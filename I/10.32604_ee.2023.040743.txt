1Introduction
With the development of industry and technology, wind energy is widely used for its cleanness,
environmental protection and sustainability [ 1]. Wind power technology has become a new technology
growth point and entered a stage of rapid development [ 2]. However, due to the harsh working
environment and the increasingly complex mechanical structure, wind turbines are prone to failure,which not only increases the maintenance cost of the wind power plant, but also seriously affects thepower output [ 3,4].

Blades are one of the main components of wind turbines. Blades working safely and efficiently
has an essential impact on the stable operation of the wind turbine. However, the harsh workingenvironment, unceasing working, and the wear between the blades and other unit components willaccumulate potential failures, quickly leading to cracks and damage to the wind turbine blades.According to the Global Wind Energy Council statistics during eight years of the wind farm operation,
about 30% of the accidents that causing shutting down for more than 7 days are caused by blade
faults [ 5]. Blade crack harms wind turbine shafting, tower cylinder and other unit components, and
if not treated, they will lead to accidents [ 6]. The cost and time required for repairing blade crack
are high [ 7,8]. Therefore, detecting the state of the blade, especially when the blade cracks under
complex working conditions, can quickly and accurately judge the fault state of the blade, which isvery important for ensuring overall efficiency, safety and reliability of the wind turbine, reducing theloss and improving the economic benefit [ 9,10].
The traditional fault detection methods on wind turbine blades include acoustic emission detec-
tion [ 11], infrared imaging detection [ 12], and abnormal vibration detection [ 13]. Although these
traditional fault detection methods have the advantages of fast detection speed and strong real-time,however, they are usually unable to detect the faults of the wind turbine blades in the working state,and have extremely high requirements on the detection environment and equipment, making themunable to be widely used in practice.
In recent years, commonly used wind turbine blade fault detection methods can be classified as
model-based and data-driven [ 14]. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and discrete mathematical
model are often used in wind turbine blade crack fault detection by using the changes in naturalfrequencies [ 15,16]. By applying the residual to describe the deviation degree of each characteristic
parameter value, and through progressive parameterization, a blade icing identification model isestablished [ 17]. However, in practical applications, due to the difficulty of modeling multiple couplings
and unexpected disturbances of system parameters, model-based methods often fail, and fan bladefault detection methods based on data analysis have received more extensive attention. Machinelearning based data analysis methods do not need complex physical model construction and can utilizeSCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition, SCADA) system data [ 18]. These methods include
support vector machine (SVM) [ 19,20], XGBoost, deep neural network (DNN), etc. DNN and other
methods extract the information from SCADA data to realize the fault detection of fan blades [ 21].
Bayesian belief networks (BNN) were also adopted for fault detection of wind turbine blades [ 22,23].
At present, in the field of fault detection, the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithmis one of the most widely used algorithms [ 24,25]. Meanwhile, in unsupervised learning research, a
wavelet enhanced autoencoder model (WaveletAE) to identify wind turbine dysfunction by analyzing
the multivariate time series monitored [ 26].
To increase the quality and reliability of data for better analysis and prediction, noise reduction
in data mining aims to eliminate extraneous noise and outliers from the data. A prominent featurescreening technique is principal component analysis (PCA), which can eliminate noise, reduce dimen-sionality, and improve model performance [ 27,28]. However, because PCA is a linear transformation
technique, it can only be used with data that can be separated along linear axes. Tree models such as
XGBoost and LightGBM are common techniques for reducing unnecessary characteristics in faultdetection [ 29,30]. However, these techniques may overlook some crucial features and cannot ensure
the integrity of variable information.
Wind turbine blade fault detection relies heavily on information fusion, which can enhance data
quality, increase the accuracy and dependability of mining findings, and so better enable data mining

applications. Although XGBoost [ 31] and LightGBM [ 32] are frequently employed to handle data
mining, the training data can introduce noise and outliers. TabNet [ 33] is a deep learning model for
tabular data that can carry out operations on tabular data such feature selection, regression, andclassification. Although TabNet is highly interpretable and performant, it is not suited for processingmassive amounts of high-dimensional tabular data because of its great reliance on the quality of the
input data. Although TabTransformer [ 34] performs well in terms of performance and interpretability,
it is not suited for processing vast amounts of high-dimensional tabular data because it is verydependent on the quality of the input data. SAINT (Self-Attentive Interactions) [ 35] is a deep learning
model for sequence data. It has large modeling capabilities and high accuracy, but it takes a long timeto train and has a strong dependence on hyperparameters. In conclusion, classic data fusion modelsrequire a lot of training time and rely heavily on the accuracy of the input data.
To address these issues, this paper proposes a Gated Fusion based Transformer Model for crack
detection on wind turbine blades by integrating GRN, a fusion module and a Transformer. GRN is adeep neural network structure that can be used for feature screening [ 36]. GRN combines a residual
network and a gating mechanism, which can effectively extract useful features in input data and removeirrelevant or redundant features while preserving the integrity of feature information. This approachcan improve the accuracy and generalization of the model. Meanwhile, this paper proposes a newinformation fusion module that is changed from the model MLP-Mixer [ 37]. The fusion module can
extract features from the two-dimensional vectors of wind turbine blades to fuse different dimensionsof information. Because the MLP in the module shares the weight in the mapping process of differentcolumns and channels, the number of parameters is significantly reduced, and the complexity of thenetwork is reduced.
This method takes the original SCADA data of wind turbine blades as the research object. It uses
the SCADA data to detect the fault of wind turbine blade crack to ensure that maintenance personnelcan timely and accurately judge whether the fault occurs and give early warning of the defect duringthe wind turbine operation. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
1. This paper introduces Gated Residual Network (GRN). GRN, through the gating mechanism,
can reduce any unnecessary noisy inputs that could negatively impact performance whilepreserving the integrity of feature information, enabling efficient information flow.
2. This paper proposes a fusion module that consists of Channel-mixing MLP and Column-
mixing MLP . By using Channel-mixing MLP and Column-mixing MLP to map the columnsacted on the data channel and map the rows acted on the data column of two-dimensionalfeature data, information fusion between the spatial and channel domains is realized. Becausethe MLP in the module shares the weight in the mapping process of different columns andchannels, the number of parameters is significantly reduced, and the complexity of the networkis reduced.
3. The experimental results show that the proposed method has a better detection effect and can
better meet the actual fan maintenance requirements than the existing methods. At the sametime, this paper also provides a new solution for table data processing.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the available SCADA data used in
this work. Section 3 introduces the model of this paper. Section 4 presents the experimental procedure
and experiment setup. Section 5 introduces and analyzes the experimental results. Section 6 is the
conclusion, including a summary of the method and future work.

2Data Description
The dataset used in this paper comes from the operation data collected from 300 wind turbines
published by State Power Investment Corporation for two consecutive months. SCADA systemcollects all kinds of information about wind turbines in real-time, including environmental, state,and control parameters. According to the wind turbine blade crack state data collected every 10 minby SCADA for wind farms, 48,339 sample files were recorded. Each file contained about 400 linesof data, and each sample had 75 features. The SCADA system collects two different types of data:
discrete characteristic variables and continuous characteristic variables. Continuous variables monitor
the operation and progress of each component in real time. Discrete variables indicate the operationstatus of each fan component. Among them, ‘state of reactive power control’, ‘current state value ofwind turbine’, ‘current state value of wheel’, ‘state of yaw value’ and ‘yaw required value’ are discretecharacteristic variables; the rest characteristics are continuous characteristic variables. An example ofthe SCADA dataset is provided in Table 1 . In addition, more detailed SCADA data can be seen in
Appendix A ,Table A1 .

Table 1 shows an example of data collected by a SCADA system. In the table, ‘WT’ uniquely
identifies each wind turbine in the wind farm. ‘wheel speed’, ‘wheel angle’, and ‘blade angle’ areworking condition parameters. ‘state of yaw value’ is a state parameter and is usually a discrete variable.
Fig. 1 compares the kernel density estimation of wheel speed for an identical fan in normal and
cracked blade states. Wheel speed is a working condition parameter. The figure shows maxima forboth normal and cracked blade data value probability densities. Thus, it is impossible to distinguishbetween normal and defective fan blades using just one working condition eigenvalue.

3Model Structure
3.1Overall Architecture
This paper presents gated fusion based Transformer model for crack detection on wind turbine
blade. The proposed model mainly includes Gated Residual Network, fusion module and Transformer.The overall architecture of proposed model is shown in Fig. 2 . First, each feature of the wind turbine
blade is subjected to feature mapping, and the feature vectors are spliced to obtain a two-dimensionalvector. Then, the gated residual neural network is used to effectively extract the features of the featurevectors and strengthen the expression of key features. Through the fusion module, the informationexchange on different channels of the same feature and the same channel of different features can berealized. Use Transformer for feature learning, enhance the influence of important feature informationand improve the anti-noise ability of the model. Finally, the state results of wind turbine blades areoutput through feature classification to achieve the purpose of crack fault detection.

3.2Feature Mapping
The input of the model includes categorical feature variables and continuous feature variables. The
proposed model uses feature embedding to embed each categorical feature variable into a parametricembedding of dimension dand map each continuous feature variable to a parametric embedding of
dimension dthrough MLP . And then, the feature vectors are spliced to obtain a two-dimensional
vector. Therefore, after feature mapping, the vector dimension input to GRN is (m+n)∗dif there
aremdiscrete feature variables and ncontinuous feature variables.
3.3Gated Residual Network
Due to subjective limitations in selecting input feature variables in commonly used fan blade
feature screening methods, the integrity of variable information cannot be guaranteed. This paperuses GRN for feature screening. Gated Residual Network (GRN) enables efficient informationflow with gating mechanism and skip connections. The framework of Gated Residual Network is
shown in Fig. 3 . The gating mechanism can reduce unnecessary noisy inputs that could negatively
impact performance. Skip connections can provide adaptive depth and network complexity. In orderto improve the performance of the model, a Dropout layer and a Swish activation function aresimultaneously added to the network. The formula of skip connection is shown in Eq. (1) .

3.4Fusion Module
The fusion module in this paper is modified from the MLP-Mixer model [ 37]. The MLP-Mixer
network model simulates the convolution operation and attention mechanism using only the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture. The original MLP-Mixer first separates the image and then
uses two MLP blocks to fuse data on each channel. Fusion module uses Channel-mixing MLP and
Column-mixing MLP alternately to extract features from the two-dimensional vectors of wind turbineblades to fuse different dimensions of information. The framework of fusion module is shown inFig. 4 . The Channel-mixing MLP and Column-mixing MLP carry out mapping transformation of
two-dimensional characteristic data in different channels of the same characteristic variables andthe same channel of different characteristic variables, thus achieving fusion operations in the spatialdomain and channel domain. To be specific, the feature vector is input into the MLP to obtain in-depth information about the same feature in different channels. Then, the processed feature vectorswere transposed so that the channels and dimensions of the data were exchanged and then input intothe MLP so that it could obtain in-depth information about different features in the same channel, andthen the channels and dimensions were transposed. Because the MLP in the module shares the weightin the mapping process of different columns and channels, the number of parameters is significantlyreduced, and the complexity of the network is reduced.

4Experiment Setup
In this section, the effectiveness of the proposed method will be evaluated through a case study
of wind turbine blade crack fault detection. The experiment of the model in this paper is completedbased on Tensorflow.
4.1Overall Experimental Process
To provide a reliable basis for wind farm staff to monitor the status of fan blades and avoid more
significant losses caused by blade crack, it is necessary to timely and accurately detect whether thereis a crack fault in wind turbines. Therefore, the proposed wind turbine blade fault detection methodis as follows.
4.1.1 Data Preprocessing
SCADA data should be cleaned to solve the problem of missing or unreasonable partial charac-
teristic data caused by sensor errors, line errors and other issues.
4.1.2 Data Segmentation
Four-fold cross-validation was used to divide the cleaned data set into 4 subsamples, one of which
was selected as the test set each time, the other 3 subsamples were chosen as the training set to conductmodel training, and 10% of the training set was selected as the verification set, which was repeated fora total of 4 times, which was equivalent to using 4 kinds of data sets to train the model.
4.1.3 Model Training and Testing
The experimental flow chart is shown in Fig. 5 . Appropriate evaluation criteria were used to
evaluate the results of each experiment. Each model had a consequence. Finally, the mean value ofthe four marks of each model was calculated as the final experimental result.

4.2Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
In real life, the database is easily affected by noise and some force majeure external factors,
resulting in missing data and errors. Correct data processing can reduce the interference of erroneousdata in the experiment and improve the efficiency and accuracy of data mining. In this experiment,the collected SCADA data were preprocessed as follows:
1. Delete data with integer row 0. Data with an integer value of 0 is obviously due to a sensor or
wire error, so it needs to be deleted.
2. Delete the last three features where the data is null: ‘Drive outputs torque 1’’, ‘Drive outputs
torque 2’, ‘Drive outputs torque 3’.
3. According to physics knowledge, the atmospheric pressure on the blade under the natural
environment cannot be 0, so the row where the characteristic atmospheric pressure is 0 in thedata set is deleted. In addition, this paper is to forecast the wind turbine in a working state, sothe row where the Wheel Speed is less than 3 m/s is deleted.
4. The four-fold cross-validation was used to divide the cleaned data set into 4 subsamples. Each
time, one of the subsamples was selected as the test set, and the other 3 subsamples were selectedas the training set for model training. 10% of the training set was selected as the verificationset, and each model repeated the experiment 4 times.
4.3Performance Evaluation Index of Fault Diagnosis
The model evaluation index can reasonably measure the model’s generalization ability and
accurately explain the quality of the model. The prediction results of this model belong to the binaryproblem. Accuracy is the proportion of correctly classified samples in total samples. Precision refersto the proportion of the predicted positive samples to the predicted positive samples. Recall is theproportion of the predicted positive samples out of the actual positive samples. F1-score is mainlyused to measure the accuracy of the binary model, taking into account the accuracy rate and recall ofthe classification model. Accuracy can intuitively see the prediction effect of the model, Precision andRecall can evaluate the prediction effect from different aspects, while F1-score combines Precisionand Recall. So with Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-score index to evaluate the model is morereasonable.
4.4Comparison Models
To verify the proposed model’s effectiveness and accuracy in detecting wind turbine blade crack
faults, it is compared with state-of-the-art methods such as XGBoost, LightGBM, LSTM, TabNet,TabTransformer, Variable Selection Network, and SAINT.
4.5Hyperparameter
The selection of hyper-parameters is of great importance in modeling. For all model training,
Adam is used for network optimization for its efficient computation and little memory. The crossentropy loss function is used in all models to train the network. Meanwhile, the initial learning rateof all neural network models is set as 0.01, if the val_loss of the model does not drop 3 times, thelearning rate will be halved to help the model converge and make it easier to obtain the best solution.If the val_loss of the model does not drop 10 times, the model will stop early to reduce overfitting.The proposed model has Embedding_dim of 64, GRN_dim of 192, Num_transformer_blocks of 4,Num_heads of 4, Dropout_rate of 0.2, and Learning_rate is 0.01, Epoch is 100 and Batch_size is 256.
For the comparison models, XGBoost has Max_depth of 300, N_estimators of 500, Colsam-
ple_bytree of 0.8 and Subsample of 0.7; LightGBM has Num_leaves of 500, N_estimators of

50, Max_depth of 0.8 and Subsample of 0.7; LSTM has Num_input_layers of 256 and Num-
ber_hidden_layers of 2; VSN has Encoding_size of 192 and VSN_dim of 72; SAINT has Num_self-attention_heads of 8, Num_intersample_heads of 8 and Embedding_dim of 64; TabNet has N_d of324, N_a of 256 and N_steps of 2; TabTransformer has Num_transformer_blocks of 4, Num_headsis 4 and Embedding_dim is 64.

The result showed that compared with other seven algorithms, the gated fusion based Transformer
model works best in F1-score which is around 0.9907, Accuracy which is around 0.9907, Recall which isaround 0.9853 and Precision which is around 0.9961. The LSTM algorithm works worst in evaluationindicators, it reaches around 0.9698 in F1-score which is reduced by around 0.0209 compared withproposed model.
Analyzing the overall experimental results, it can be found that the traditional machine learning
models such as XGBoost and LightGBM are better than the other deep learning models such asLSTM, TabNet, VSN, TabTransformer. And there is little difference between experimental results ofLightGBM and SAINT. The F1-score of LightGBM is around 0.9896, which is increased by around0.0042–0.0171 compared with LSTM, TabNet, VSN and TabTransformer. Compared with XGBoostand LightGBM, the F1-score value of the model used in this paper has increased by 0.0072 and 0.0038,respectively.
From the perspective of stability, it is clear that the fault detecting ability of machine learning
models is more stable than other models including the gated fusion based Transformer model.Comparing proposed model and other deep learning models, the fluctuation of Accuracy andPrecision range is too small. In conclusion, the Gated Fusion based Transformer Model proposedin this paper has high prediction accuracy and stability.

5.3Discussion
This paper proposes a crack fault-detection strategy for high-precision wind blade crack detection.
Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms conventional fault detection models. TheF1-score of proposed model can reach 0.9907, which is 0.0040–0.0209 higher than traditional models.The accuracy of proposed model can also reach 0.9907, which is 0.0013–0.0212 higher than traditionalmodels. Its recall can reach 0.9853, which is 0.0009–0.0252 higher than traditional models. Its precision
can reach 0.9961, which is 0.0036–0.0164 higher than traditional models. These results demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed model.
The ablation experiment reveal that the model’s gated residual neural network, fusion module, and
Transformer all contribute to superior experimental outcomes. GRN reduces unnecessary noisy inputs
that could negatively impact performance while preserving the integrity of feature information. The
fusion module fuses information between the spatial and channel domains to comprehensively obtainthe in-depth information of fan features. The proposed model is suitable for structured data with bothcategorical and continuous feature variables. However, the gated fusion based Transformer model isless stable than XGBoost and LightGBM. The stability and generalization ability of the proposedmodel should be further improved.
6Conclusions
Considering that the data collected by the SCADA system is complex and challenging to obtain
the features related to the target information, a new state monitoring Model–Gated Fusion basedTransformer Model is proposed in this paper, which is used for wind turbine blade crack faultdetection. Gated residual network was used for effective feature extraction and enhanced expressionof critical features. The fusion module proposed in this paper can map two-dimensional feature datain columns acted on the data channel and rows acted on the data column, realize the informationfusion between the spatial domain and the channel domain, and obtain the in-depth information offan features more comprehensively. Finally, the model can enhance the influence of important featureinformation and improve the detection accuracy of the model by Transformer. The experimentalresults show that the model yields state-of-the-art performance.
In summary, the method proposed in this paper outperforms other fault detection methods.
The experiments used a dataset with single fault. Future research could study methods for detectingmultiple types of faults in fan blade data.
