Abstract: When wind turbine blades are icing, the output power of a wind turbine tends to
reduce, thus informing the selection of two basic variables of wind speed and power. Then other
features, such as the degree of power deviation from the power curve ﬁtted by normal sample data,
are extracted to build the model based on the random forest classiﬁer with the confusion matrix for
result assessment. The model indicates that it has high accuracy and good generalization ability
veriﬁed with the data from the China Industrial Big Data Innovation Competition. This study looks
at ice detection on wind turbine blades using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
data and thereafter a model based on the random forest classiﬁer is proposed. Compared with other
classiﬁcation models, the model based on the random forest classiﬁer is more accurate and more
efﬁcient in terms of computing capabilities, making it more suitable for the practical application on
ice detection.

1. Introduction
With the gradual depletion of traditional fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas,
the development and use of new energy such as wind power has received increasing attention making
wind power one of the fastest growing energy sources in the world [ 1]. In 2017, the newly installed
capacity of wind power worldwide reached 52,492 MW, and the cumulative installed capacity reached
539,123 MW. Among them, the newly installed capacity of wind power in China accounted for 37%,
and the cumulative installed capacity accounted for 35%. The newly installed capacity of wind power
accounts for more than 15% of the total installed capacity in recent years, and the cumulative installed
capacity accounts for a steady increase. The Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) predicts that as costs
drop and the market begins to recover at the end of this decade; global wind power installed capacity
will increase by more than 50% over the next ﬁve years. According to GWEC, as countries around the
world develop renewable energy sources to achieve emission reduction targets, wind energy costs
continue to decline, and by the end of 2022 installed capacity global wind power is expected to increase
to 840 GW [2].
Wind power however faces some challenges that restrict its development with cost making of
the list of the important issue. According to the study of Department of Energy (DOE), United States,
20% revenue growth of wind farms by 2030 will come from improvement of wind turbine working
status and reduction of maintenance costs. Using the appropriate maintenance and maintenance
strategy to reduce the cost of operation and maintenance is an important way to increase wind
farm income [3].

Land-based wind farms are established mostly based on high altitude mountainous areas.
These regions experience low temperature and high humidity, which makes it possible for wind turbine
blades to form varying degrees of icing easily, especially in winter. However, there are shutdown events
caused by wind turbine blade icing, which seriously threatens the normal operation of wind power
plants. Any wind turbine blade icing will cause power loss, mechanical failure, equipment failure,
and safety issues [ 4]. The freezing of wind turbine blades changes the aerodynamic performance of
the blades, which yield into power generation loss. Equally, the uneven distribution of ice from the
blade changes the original mass distribution, making the wind turbine to run unstably, and causing
severe damage to the blade in varying degrees, which not only lead to huge economic losses, but also
have serious security risks [ 5]. Therefore, a reliable detection method for icing wind turbine blade is
very important, especially in the early stage icing detection.
Now there are many standards and guidelines that have been developed by the IEC (International
Electro technical Commission), and it has helped us a lot in analyzing turbine faults [ 6]. For the
problem of ice detection in the blades, the existing methods mainly use the mechanism of icing to
conduct theoretical analysis and research and establish the physical model of icing, then according
to the monitoring data, make a judgment whether the wind turbine blades are frozen at the current
moment. Davies et al. studied three methods of creating a power threshold curve to distinguish
the ice growth period from the non-icing period to identify the power loss caused by icing [ 7].
Wang et al. proposed a numerical simulation method for three-dimensional wind turbine blade
icing and compared it with experimental results to verify the effectiveness of the method [ 8]. Shu et al.
studied the characteristics of leaf icing and the severity of icing on the power characteristics of wind
turbines under natural icing conditions [ 9]. Blasco et al. performed a quantitative analysis of the power
loss of a representative 1.5 MW wind turbine under various icing conditions, attempting to reduce the
loss of wind farms in cold regions by formulating some control strategies [ 10]. Based on the analysis
of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data, Li et al. proposed a method for detection
of blade icing based on logistic regression [ 11]. Aral et al. proposes and demonstrates Phase-based
Motion Estimation (PME) and a motion magniﬁcation algorithm to perform non-contact structural
damage detection of a wind turbine blade [ 12]. Yu et al. developed a simple method to detect damage
based on a discrete mathematical model for fan blades using changes in natural frequencies combined
with a ﬂuid-structure analysis [ 13]. The above research generally requires additional sensor placement
for wind turbine blades. The disadvantages such as inconvenient practical application and increased
wind farm operation and maintenance cost make them unable to be widely used in practice.
Vibration signal analysis [ 14] and SCADA system data analysis are two different aspects.
The former pays more attention to the analysis of the equipment mechanism, while the latter tends to
analyze the data. Both have their own advantages. Wind turbine blades work at high altitude, and they
are inconvenient to measure the vibration acceleration signal ofﬂine. The amount of acceleration signal
on the line is larger, which is inconvenient to transmit and store. Therefore, more and more people are
committed to using SCADA data to predict and diagnose wind turbine faults. The SCADA system is
the most widely used and technologically advanced data acquisition and monitoring system, in fault
diagnosis of a large amount of wind power equipment [ 14–19]. This system collects environmental
parameters and operating parameters of wind power equipment, which can fully characterize the
operational status of the wind turbine. More and more people use it for data modeling and analysis to
mine information of equipment fault and blade icing detection, etc. [20–24].
When the wind turbine blade is early frozen and detected by the model in this paper, this warning
information will be fed back to the wind farm owners (or managers, or controllers). At this time,
the wind farm has not experienced a serious accident. This early warning information of early icing
gave them time to deal with the icing of the wind turbine blades. During this time, they could use
other methods to reasonably arrange when to take measures such as deicing the blades, to prevent loss
and damage due to severe icing of wind turbine blades.

2.1. Ice Detection on Wind Turbine Blades
2.1.1. Theory and Process of Icing
Icing is a physical phenomenon with a complete and specialized theory and research system.
Blade icing of wind turbines is a type of atmospheric icing. The international standard ISO12494:
2017 [ 25] describes in detail the deﬁnition, scope, classiﬁcation, principle, characteristics, and effects of
such an icing. For wind turbines, atmospheric icing refers to the process of icing in the air frozen or
adhered to objects exposed in the atmosphere under certain atmospheric conditions, including water
droplets, rain, drizzle, snow, and other forms.
There are three forms of blade icing: cloud ice, sedimentation ice and accumulation of frost. Cloud ice
refers to icing condensed from sub-cooled water droplets ﬂoating in clouds; sedimentation ice refers
to icing caused by freezing rain or wet snow under low temperature conditions; frost accumulation
refers to the direct phase change of water vapor. The icing process usually occurs at low temperatures.
Among them, cloud ice and sedimentation ice are more common in wind turbine icing, and once it
occurs, it will have a serious impact on the wind turbine and cause more damage.
2.1.2. Ice Detection Method
Ice detection analysis on blades is generally composed of several parts such as physical
principle analysis, icing process analysis, feature extraction, detection model establishment and result
presentation. This paper adopts blade detection model construction process based on a random forest
classiﬁcation, as shown in Figure 1.

Severe icing detection during the actual operation of the wind turbine is easily established,
but automatically deicing by the wind turbine deicing system is also a challenge. However, the icing
of the wind turbine blade is a slow process. In the early days of icing, the impact on the wind turbine
is generally small and difﬁcult to ﬁnd. Besides, early icing will cause certain changes to the shape of
the blades, which will cause water droplets in the atmosphere to stick to and freeze at the surface of
the blades. Eventually, the probability of serious icing is greatly increased. The treatment of early icing
is easier and has less impact on the wind turbine. It has a certain early warning effect of the occurrence
of severe icing. Therefore, the detection of early icing is very important.

2.2.1. Random Forest Classiﬁer
The random forest [ 26] is a machine learning algorithm ﬁrst published in 2001 by Breiman, L.
which combines bagging ensemble learning theory [ 27] proposed in 1996, with the stochastic subspace
method proposed by Ho, T. in 1998 [ 28]. This model adopts bootstrapping re-sampling technology to
randomly select n samples from the original training sample set N and put it back randomly to generate
a new training sample set to train a decision tree. Then, the above steps generate m decision trees to
form a random forest. The classiﬁcation results of new data-based upon the score formed by how many
classiﬁcation trees vote. Its essence is an improvement in the decision tree algorithm, with multiple
decision trees merged together. The establishment of each tree depends on the independently extracted
samples. Figure 2 shows the basic structure of the random forest classiﬁer.

3.1. Data Sources and Introduction
In this paper, the test data are driven from the ﬁrst China Industrial Big Data Innovation
Competition [ 30], which contains two wind turbines SCADA data in a wind farm provided by
Goldwind for predicting icing failures on blades. The SCADA data of each wind turbine contains
28 variables such as the time stamp, operating condition parameters, environmental parameters,
and status parameters. The acquisition time was two months and with the sample size of about 580,000.
Table 2 shows the statistical information of SCADA data. In addition, more detailed information of
SCADA data can be seen in the Appendix A, Table A1.

In addition, the organizers of the event conducted preliminary processing on the data,
which removed severely frozen data and made the data not continuous; the data was also standardized,
thus lost the physical meaning of the original data. Standardization means that making the mean of
every variable in data is 0 and the variance is 1. The contest organizer has already set the labels for the
data-icing and non-icing (due to the authority of the data owner and the supervisor, the accuracy of
the data label is guaranteed, so the basis for judging whether the data is frozen or not is also credible);
we only need to process the data that has been tagged.

3.2. Features Extraction
Some indicators in the raw data given by the contest organizers are sensitive to icing, and some
indicators are almost not related to icing. So, the ﬁrst step in this paper on the data is to pick out the
icing-sensitive indicators from the raw data indicators. However, relying solely on these indicators
does not well identify early icing data from non-icing data, this paper further processed the data and
obtained some better indicators of icing and non-icing. In general, it is through the screening and
supplementation of indicators to achieve better characterization of early icing with fewer features,
which not only reduces the running time of the model but also gives better results.
This section will introduce the process of data preprocessing, including the screening of basic
features and the construction of other features, with giving some ﬁgures to make features more
intuitively judgment—whether it is easier to distinguish between icing and non-icing.
Extraction features, especially quantitative features [ 31] are very essential for the fault diagnosis of
equipment. On the one hand, because the inertia of the wind turbine blade will reduce the correlation
between the instantaneous power and the instantaneous wind speed, taking the average value from
the data over a certain time span can reduce the inertial effect to some extent. On the other hand,
in the original data, about 8 samples are collected every minute, but because the data provider has
deleted some data, the sample interval time in the data is not ﬁxed. So, the data are resampled in
one-minute intervals, the speciﬁc process is as follows. According to the timestamp, the SCADA data
grouped every minute for the time span, and then the mean of each group sample is taken as the new
sample characteristics.

å
i=1wind _speed i (3)
where Vis the average wind speed—the new sample characteristics; nis the number of wind_speed in
one minute. The solutions of average power P and other new variables are the same as Equation (3).
Then the data is ﬁltered.
1. Filter unspeciﬁed data. In the given raw data set, the data covers normal sample data, icing
sample data, and other unspeciﬁed data, according to the status tag. Unspeciﬁed data will
affect the classiﬁcation of normal sample data/icing sample data, due to the uncertainty of its
information; it will be classiﬁed as invalid data.
2. Filter samples below 80% of full power. Taking wind turbine 21# as an example, it can be found
that when the wind turbine is at more than 80% full power icing status data does not exist by
comparison of the original instantaneous power-wind speed scatter plot (shown in Figure 3),
and the processed average power-wind speed scatter plot (shown in Figure 4). In other words,
the wind turbine power cannot reach 80% of full power after the blade’s freeze. Filter the samples
below 80% of full power can make it easier to identify early icing data.
In following ﬁgures, the green points are in the wind turbine normal state and the red points are
in the icing state. The blue lines in Figures 3 and 4 represent the dividing lines representing 80% of
full power.

In the early stage of icing, the operation state of the wind turbine is similar to the normal state, 
and it is difficult to separate the icing state from the normal state. However, the detection of early 
icing conditions is a very important process, and the healthy operation of the wind turbine unit is of 
utmost importance. It can minimize the loss to the unit due to icing on the blades. Because icing is a 
cumulative process, instantaneous characteristics such as the wind speed, the power, and the degree 
of deviation make it difficult to characterize fully icing conditions, especially in the early icing part. 
Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the evolution of the icing process and extract features that can 
characterize icing changes to better distinguish early icing conditions and achieve early icing 
prediction.

4.1. Classiﬁcation Model Optimization
This paper mainly adjusts two important parameters of the model based on the random forest
classiﬁer to optimize the model: the number of trees and the maximum depth of the tree. Divide 70%
of sample data of wind turbine 15# into the training set, 30% of sample data into the test set, adjust the
number of decision tree and maximum depth of a tree in the random forest classiﬁer, and then calculate
the output from the model. The confusion matrix is chosen as the evaluation index, and the calculation
results are shown in Table 4.

4.2. Test Results
After the optimization of the model based on the random forest classiﬁer in the previous section,
the parameters of the model based on the random forest classiﬁer are determined.
The next four groups of tests are about the different classiﬁcation results of the model based on the
random forest classiﬁer between data of wind turbines 15# and 21#. The train and test set details and
the classiﬁcation results from each test are as follows. In addition, in the following tables, the indicator,
the running time, refers to the total time the model takes to training and predicts the data on the
experimental computer.
In the Test No. 1, 70% of the sample data of the wind turbine 15# was divided into training sets,
and 30% of the sample data was divided into a test set. The results are shown in Table 5.

Consequently, the classiﬁcation results between different classiﬁcation models are also compared.
This paper selects the logistic regression classiﬁer, the GBDT (Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) classiﬁer
and the random forest classiﬁer for comparison. In these tests, 70% of the sample data of the wind
turbine 15# is the training set, and 30% of the sample data is set as the test set.
Test No.5 used a logistic regression classiﬁcation model. After the optimization, the classiﬁcation
threshold was set to 0.86, as results shown in Table 9 demonstrate.

The precision and recall of the six tests computed separately, and the obtained results are shown
in Table 11.

Where RF means random forest classiﬁer, and LR means logistic regression classiﬁer.
As we all known, for a classiﬁcation model, when both precision and recall have higher values at
the same time without considering other factors, the model is thought to have a better performance.
Through the comparison of test results we draw, the following summary is concluded:
1. Considering precision and recall at the same time, the results of the model based on the random
forest classiﬁer are better than other models (as the result of Table 11 shown), so that the model
based on the random forest classiﬁer has high accuracy in ice detection of wind turbine blades
and can identify the early failure.
2. The trained model based on the random forest classiﬁer still performs well on a new test set
(as the results of Tests No. 3 and No. 4 shown), so that the model has good generalization ability,
thus it has a strong adaptability to the new sample data.
3. The data of wind turbine 15# is more than the data of 21#. From the results of these tests (as the
results of Tests No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4), when only focusing on precision and recall
without considering the running time, increasing the sample size of the training set can improve
the classiﬁcation performance of the model.
4. Considering the running time of these models, the model based on the random forest classiﬁer
shorter running time than the logistic regression and the GBDT classiﬁcation models (as the
results of Tests No. 5 and No. 6), so that the model based on the random forest classiﬁer has more
efﬁcient calculation ability.
5. Conclusions
To detect wind turbine blade icing, a model based on the random forest classiﬁer was proposed.
The model with high accuracy and good generalization ability was veriﬁed by the data of the China
Industrial Big Data Innovation Competition.
1. The features extracted in this paper well reﬂect the characteristics of icing failure. Two basic
variables of wind speed and output power from SCADA data and more instantaneous and
statistical features extracted from a power curve can be used to characterize the early icing on
wind turbine blades. The various models selected in this paper have good results on this data
set. So, it has high practical application value for ice detection in wind farms, which, as reﬂected
in the effective prevention of severe ice formation in the blades, increase of wind farm’s proﬁt,
and reduction of safety accident.
2. The model based on the random forest classiﬁer has very high accuracy and good generalization
ability for ice detection on a wind turbine’s blades, which is used to identify the early icing.
Compared with other classiﬁcation models, the model based on the random forest classiﬁer has
higher accuracy and more efﬁciency in terms of computing capabilities, making it more suitable
for the practical application of ice detection.

3. In the identiﬁcation of new data, the accuracy of the model has reached more than 80%,
which shows that there is room for further improvement. In the future, it can expand better
features or use other models to ensure the best results in both accuracy and generalization.
