 Abstract --- This study makes an attempt of classifying 
different fault  conditions which occurs on wind turbine blade due 
to environmental stress and high wind speed. “Here three bladed 
horizontal axis variable wind turbine was used for experimental 
study and different faults like blade crack, hub -blade loose 
connection, eros ion, pitch angle twist and blade bend was 
considered. This study had been carried out in three phases 
namely feature extraction, feature selection and feature 
classification. Initially vibration signals are noted for different 
blade conditions and required  features are obtained using 
histogram features . Secondly, from the extracted feature, most 
dominating feature need to be chosen using J48 decision tree 
classifier. Later, the selected feature is fed into the classifiers like 
Nested Dichotomy ( ND), Class -Balanced Nested Dichotomies 
(CBND) and Data near Balanced Nested Dichotomy ( DNBND) 
for classification of the faults. These classifiers are compared 
with respect to their accuracy to suggest a better model for fault 
diagnosis  on blade.  The suggested model ca n be incorporated in 
real-time system to monitor the condition of wind turbine blade .”

I. INTRODUCTION  
Renewable energy  sources have drawn  in much 
consideration because of their positive influence  on society 
and environment. “Wind energy  is a rapid  growing clean 
renewable energy  source  [1]. 
Wind turbines are actuality  produced  to upgrade 
operational implementation  and yiel d through expanding 
blade size  and enhancing physical  framework . It has been 
confirmed  that blade damage  may bring about lack in 
productivity , and its repair is ex pensive  and req uires 
considerable repair time.  
To avoid  extreme blade damage  and minor failur es, it is 
important to identify the early failures  by routine  
monitoring , and proceeding with evaluation  of the structural 
health of wind turbine blades  [2]. The objective  of this study 
is to build up a model for the condition monitoring of wind 
turbine bl ade using machine learning approach. ”

Krishna College of Engineering and Technology, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu.  There are two types of approaches which are carried out 
on condition monitoring assessment they are traditional 
approach and machine learning approach. “The traditional 
approach is mainly used for the stationary signal s where 
frequency of the signals component does not change with 
respect to time but rotating machines prod uce non -stationary 
signals [3].  
Since the frequency components change due to wear and 
tear, fault discrimination is very difficult in traditional 
approach. Hence, not preferred. In machine learning 
approach, algorithms have capability to learn continuously 
and adapt themselves to the varying situations. Researches 
often resort to machine learning approach for fault diagnosis 
of mechanical systems [4]. ” 
Many studies were carried out using machine learning 
studies and simulation studies to name a few, Andrew 
Kusiak and Anoop Verma [5] built a data -driven model for 
monitoring blade pitch faults in wind turbines.  “They 
considered two blade pitch faults namel y, blade angle 
asymmetry and blade angle implausibility and determine  the 
associations between them.  
They conducted the study using bagging (72.5%), 
artificial neural network (76.2%), pruning rule -based 
classification tree (75.5%), K -nearest neighbour (73. 5%) 
and genetic programming (74.7%) algorithms. They 
considered only pitch fault and other faults were not 
considered in their study. ” 
Abouhnik and Albarbar [6] simulated crack in wind 
turbine blades and carried out crack location prediction 
study using vi bration measurements and the level of an 
empirically decomposed feature intensity level (EDFIL) . 
“The main drawback in this study is they do not consider 
other fault parameters in their study expect crack. A 
classification and detection of wind turbine pit ch faults were 
done by Godwin and Matthews [7]. They used R IPPER 
algorithm in their study.  They diagnosed the electrical 
control system faults, in particular, wind turbine pitch faults 
which yielded them 87.05% classification accuracy. They 
considered pitc h faults alone in this study.  
A study on integrating structural health management with 
contingency control for wind turbines using nonlinear high 
fidelity simulation was carried out by Frost et al ., [8] . They 
studied about the structural health of the blad e, the speed of 
the turbine and decision making using prognostic 
information and achieved 90% accuracy in their work. They 
have done the study for blade bend fault; and not considered 
other faults.  Fault Diagnosis of Wind Turbine Blades

 Chen et al., [ 9] conducted an experiment on wind turbine  
pitch faults prognosis using apriori knowledge based 
adaptive neuro -fuzzy inference  system (ANFIS) and 
SCADA data.  They obtained 88.30% classification accuracy 
for the blade pitch fault. In this study also they considered 
pitch fault alone. ”  
A work on st ructural health monitoring of wind turbine 
blades with acoustic source localization using wireless 
sensor networks was done by Bouzid et al., [ 10]. “They 
done the online monitoring of the blade for the fault 
identification of erosion and crack which affect s the blade 
using acoustic emission N DT. They predicted the error rate 
of 7.98%. Lee et al., [ 11] done a work on wind turbine blade 
moment signals to blade condition monitoring using a 
transformation algorithm. They presented a novel method of 
transforming  blade moment signals on a horizontal axis 3 -
blade wind turbine.  
Herath et al., [ 12] conducted a study on the design of 
shape adaptive wind turbine blades using differential 
stiffness bend twist (DSBT) coupling using FEA analysis. 
They proposed this concep t to control the deformation 
behaviour in the blades. Liu et al., [ 13] carried out a study 
on the influence of alternating loads on nonlinear vibration 
characteristics of cracked blade in a r otor system using FEM 
analysis.  They did the experiment for diffe rent alternating 
loads for the identification of the crack fault and other faults 
not taken into consideration. ” 
Numerous works were carried out using simulation 
studies however, only a very few of the experimental studies 
for condition monitoring on wind turbine blade was carried 
out. Some researchers carried out fault diagnosis system 
using machine learning approach and they considered very 
few faults in their study. “Only selected algorithms were 
used to perform the fault prediction on wind turbine blade  
and many algorithms are yet to be studied  [14]. Figure 1

Figure 1: Methodology  1. This study considers more than two faults for fault

blade bend).

classification problem and attempts to classify 
using classifiers such as Nested Dichotomy ( ND), 
Class -Balanced Nested Dichotomies  (CBND) and 
Data  near Balanced Nested Dichotomy  
(DNBND). ” 
II. EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES  
The main aim of this study is to classify whether the 
blades are in good condition or in a defective state. “If it is 
defective, then the objective is to identify the type of fault. 
The experim ental setup and experimental procedure are 
described in the following subsections.  
Experimental Setup  
The experiment was carried out on a 50W, 12V variable 
speed wind turbine (MX -POWER, model: FP -50W -12V). 
The technical parameters of a wind turbine are giv en in 
Table 1. The wind turbine was mounted on a fixed steel 
stand in front of the o pen circuit wind tunnel outlet.  
The wind tunnel speed ranges from 5m/s to 15 m/s and 
acts as a wind source to start the wind turbine. The wind 
speed was varied continuously  in order to simulate th e 
environmental wind condition. The experimen tal setup is 
shown in Figure 2.  
Piezoelectric type accelerometer was used as a transducer 
for acquiring vibration signals. It has high se nsitivity for 
detecting faults.  
Hence, acceleromet ers are widely used in condition 
monitoring. In this case, an uniaxial accelerometer of 500g 
range, 100 mV/g sensitivity, and resonant frequency around 
40 Hz was used.

technique.  
It was connecte d to the DAQ system through a cable. The 
data acquisition system (DAQ) used was NI USB 4432 
model. The DAQ card has five analogue input channels with

 a sampling rate of 102.4 -kilo samples per second with 24 -
bit resolution. The accelerometer is coupled to  a signal 
conditioning unit which consists of an inbuilt charge 
amplifier and an analo gue-to-digital converter (ADC).  
From the ADC, the vibration signal was taken. These 
vibration signals were used to extract features throug h 
feature extraction technique.  
One end of the cable is plugged to the accelerometer and 
the other end to the AIO port of DAQ system. NI – 
LabVIEW was used to interface the transducer signal and 
the system (PC).  
Experimental Procedure  
In the present study, three -blade variable horizontal  axis 
wind turbine (HAWT) was used.  
Initially, the wind turbine was considered to be in good 
condition (free from defects, new setup) and the signals 
were r ecorded using an accelerometer.  
These signals were recorded with the following 
specifications.  
1. Sampl e length: The sample length was chosen 
long enough to ensure data consistency; and also 
the following points were considered. ARMA 
measures are more meaningful when the number of 
samples is sufficiently large. On the other hand, as 
the number of samples in creases the computation 
time increases. To strike a balance, a sample length 
of 10000 was chosen.  
2. Sampling Frequency:  The sampling frequency 
should be at least twice the highest frequency 
contained in the signal as per Nyquist sampling 
theorem. By using th is theorem sampling 
frequency was calculated as 12 kHz (12000Hz).  
3. Number of samples:  Minimum of 100 (hundred) 
samples were taken for each condition of the wind 
turbine blade and the vibration signals were stored 
in data files.  
 
Figure 2 : Wind Turbine Setu p 
The following faults were simulated one at a time while 
all other components remain in good condition and the 
corresponding v ibration signals were acquired.  Figure 3 shows the different blade fault conditions which are 
simulated on the blade.  
a) Blade bend (BB):  This fault occurs due to the 
high-speed wind and complex forces caused by the 
wind. The blade was made to flap wise bend with 
10 º angle.  
b) Blade crack (BC -2): This occurs due to foreign 
object damage on the blade while it is in operating 
condition. On  the blade, 15mm crack was made.  
c) Blade erosion (BE):  This fault is due to the 
erosion of the top layer of the blade by the high -
speed wind. The smooth surface of the blade was 
eroded using emery sheet (320Cw) to provide an 
erosion effect on the blade.  
d) Hub -blade loose contact:  This fault generally 
occurs on a wind turbine blade due to an excessive 
runtime or usage time. The bolt connecting the hub 
and blade was made loose to obtain this fault.  
e) Blade pitch angle twist (PAT):  This fault occurs 
due to the stre ss on the blade caused by high -speed 
wind. This makes the pitch get twisted, creating a 
heavy vibration to the framework.  To attain this 
fault, blade pitch was twisted about 12º angle with 
respect to the normal blade condition.

Figure 4 : Vibration Signal Plot  
In Figure 4, the vibration sig nals (sample number vs. 
amplitude) are shown which were taken for different 
conditions of the wind turbine blade (good condition blade, 
blade bend, blade erosion, hub -blade loose connection, 
blade crack and pitch angle twist).  
III. FEATURE EXTRACTION  
The vibrat ion signals were obtained for good and other 
faulty conditions of the blades. If the time domain sampled 
signals are given directly as inputs to a classifier, then the 
number of samples should be constant. The number of 
samples obtained are the function of  rotation of the blade 
speed. “Hence, it cannot be used directly as the input to the 
classifier. However, a few features must be extracted before 
the classification process. The histogram was used as a 
feature extracting tool in this study. From the noted 
vibration signals, the needed feature is taken and that features are denoted as histogram features. There are two 
main factors to be considered in selection of bins they are, 
bin range and bin width [ 15]. 
The bin range must be from lowest of minimum 
amplit ude ( -0.017988) to extreme of maximum amplitude 
(0.024833) of all the six classes (good, bend, crack, erosion, 
loose and PAT). The number of bins for the fault diagnosis 
of wind turbine blade has been attained by carrying out a 
sequence of trials using J48  algorithm with different number 
of bins. Initially, the range of bin is separated into two 
equivalent portions. That is to say, the number of bins 
utilized is two. The two histogram features, to be specific,

 X1 and X2 are extracted and the relating clas sification 
accuracy is additionally acquired by using J48 algorithm.  
The approach and methodology of performing the same 
using J48 algorithm are clarified in Section 4. A set of 
related trails is done with various numbers of bins from 2, 3, 
4,5,…, 100 and  the corresponding results are shown in 
figure 5.  
 
Figure 5: Bin R ange vs. Classification Accuracy  
From figure 5, bin size 77 has been chosen since the 
classification accuracy of bin 77 was found to be 92%. A set 
of 77 starting from X1, X2… X77 were extra cted from the 
vibration signals and these are  denoted as histogram 
features.  
The amplitude ranges from -0.017988 to 0.024833. For 
further study, rather than utilizing vibration signals directly, 
the histogram features extracted from vibration signals are 
utilized.  
The procedure of calculating applicable parameters of the 
signals that represent the data contained in the signal is 
called feature extraction. Histogram analysis of vibration 
signals yields distinctive parameters. ” 
All the extracted histogram fea tures, X1 to X77 extracted 
from the vibration signals may not contain the needed 
information for classification. The applicable ones are 
selected using J48 algorithm.  
IV. FEATURE SELECTION  
Once the bin size 77 is chosen, the applicable features are 
to be selec ted from the bin since some features will be less 
predicting the faults. “For feature extraction, J48 algorithm 
is used where they predict the classes in a tree structure [ 16].  
A typical tree comprises of a number of branches, one 
root, a number of nodes and a number of leaves. One branch 
is a chain of nodes from the root to a leaf; and each node 
involves one feature. The occurrence of a feature in a tree 
delivers the data about the significance of the accompanying 
feature.  
J48 algorithm provides the infor mation of most 
contributing features in the bin via top -down tree structure. 
Features that have less discriminating capability can be 
deliberately rejected by fitting the threshold.  
This conception makes use of in choosing good features 
by the algorithm by  inbuilt nature. Features which have 
good discriminating ability alone will appear in the tree. The 
features which dominate usually represent the condition of 
wind tur bine blade.  
From figure 6, X33 is the most dominating feature 
followed by X34, X35, X36 a nd X32.  
 
Figure 6: J48 Tree Classification for Feature Selection  
V. FEATURE CLASSIFICATION  
Next step after feature selection is feature classification. 
The chosen elements are to be classified utilizing the Nested 
Dichotomy classifier.  
Nested Dichotomy (ND)  
A basic approach to enhance the classification accuracy 
for problems with a little number of classes is to store two -
class models and re -use them in distinctive individuals of an 
ensemble of nested dichotomies. “An arrangement of nested 
dichotomies is a st atistical model that is utilized to break 
down a multi -class issue into numerous two -class issues. 
The breakdown can be characterized by as a binary tree. 
Every hub of the tree stores an arrangement of class names, 
the equivalent preparing training data an d a binary classifier. 
At the absolute starting point, the root hub contains the 
entire collections of the original class labels relating to the 
multi -class characterization issue. This set is then divided 
into two subsets. These two subsets of class names  are 
treated as two „meta ‟ classes and a binary classifier is 
learned for predicting them.  The training dataset is divided 
into two subsets relating to the two metaclasses and one 
subset of training data is viewed as the positive illustrations 
while the ot her subset of testing data is viewed as the 
negative cases. The two successor hubs of the root acquire 
the two subsets of the first class names with their 
corresponding training datasets and a tree is built by 
applying this process recursively. The procedu re, at last, 
achieves a leaf hub if the hub contains one and only class 
name. It is clear that for any given c -class issue, the tree 
contains c leaf hubs (one for every class) and ( c−1) interior 
hubs. Each interior hub contains a binary classifier. A good 
feature of utilizing a system of nested dichotomies for multi -
class issues is that it yields class probability estimates in a 
direct manner. Frank and Kramer [ 17] inspected arbitrar y 
from the space of every single conceivable tree by 
considering every tree with equivalent probability.

 The determination of the tree structure will impact the 
characterization results. It signifies well to utilize all 
conceivable nested dichotomies for a given issue and mean 
their probability assessments to yield exact forecasts. For a 
c-class issue, the quantity of conceivable frameworks of 
nested dichotomies is (2c  − 3)!!. Subsequently, utilizing all 
conceivable nested dichotomies is not possible. Without 
former learning, any sampling plan that does not give 
special treatment to a specific class can be considered as a 
suitable competitor. The issue with arbitrary sa mpling based 
on uniform appropriation over trees is that the tree depth is 
just constrained by the number of classes, and deep trees can 
take quite a while to build.  
Class -Balanced Nested Dichotomies (CBND)  
The class -balanced nested dichotomy (CBND) techni que 
depends on adjusting the number of classes at every hub. 
“Rather than testing from the space of every single 
conceivable tree (as in nested dichotomy), it is sampled 
from the space of every balanced tree. The benefit of this 
strategy is that the depth of the tree is ensured to be 
logarithmic in the number of  classes.  
The number of conceivable class - balanced nested 
dichotomies is clearly smaller than the aggregate number of 
nested dichotomies [ 18]. The relation characterizes the 
number of conceivable cl ass-balanced trees.  
(1) 
At every hub, the arrangement of classes is divided into 
equivalent size subsets (obviously, if the number of classes 
is odd, the size won't be precisely equivalent), and the base 
learning algorithm is used to the data comparing to these 
two subsets. The algorithm then recuses until one and only 
class is left out.  
It is applied over and over with distinctive random 
number seeds to produce a committee of trees. It 
demonstrates that a non -paltry number of class -balanced 
nested dichotomy can be produced for classification issues 
with five or more classes. There is a further chance to 
enhance the training time for ga therings of nested 
dichotomies.  
This is an added advantage of the class based nested 
dichotomy.  There is a disa dvantage with the class balanced 
methodology. Some multi -class issues are extremely 
unequal and a few classes are conside rably more crowded 
than others.  
In that case, a class -balanced tree does not imply that it is 
also data balanced. This can contrarily i nfluence runtime if 
the base learning algorithm has time unpredictability more 
regrettable than linear in the number of instances.  
Data near Balanced Nested Dichotomy (DNBND)  
An easy algorithm called data near balanced nested 
dichotomy (DNBND) can be utili zed as a substitute for the 
class balanced nested dichotomy. “Since this system violets 
the condition that the sampling plan should not be one -sided 
towards a specific class.  
It arbitrary appoints classes to two subsets until the size 
of the training data in one of the subsets surpasses a large 
portion of the aggregate sum of training data at the hub. It is exceptionally fundamental to keep up a level of arbitrariness 
in the task of classes to subsets with a specific end goal to 
protect differing qualities in the committee of randomly 
generated systems of nested dichotomies [ 19]. 
On account of a skewed class appropriation, the base 
nested dichotomy algorithms‟ runtime is more poor than 
linear. 
In that case, the number of instances is separated as 
uniformly a s could be expected under the circumstances at 
every hub, in order to diminish the greatest measure of data 
considered at a hub as fast as would be prudent. ”  
VI. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
The vibration signals were noted for good condition and 
faulty blade condi tions using DAQ. “Totally 600 samples 
were collected; out of which 100 samples were from good 
condition blade. For different faults such as like blade bend, 
erosion, blade crack, hub -blade loose connection, pitch 
angle twist, 100 samples from every conditi on were noted.  
J48 decision tree algorithm was used to select the best 
contributing histogram features from bin size 77. From 
Figure 5 and 6, the selected features are given as the input to 
the classifier to determine the classification accuracy with 
respect to faults created on the wind turbine blade.  
From Figure 7, the class -balanced nested dichotomy 
(CBND) classifier gives the maximum classification 
accuracy of 93.17% when compared to other classifiers. In 
Nested Dichotomy, the default classifier is fix ed to be 
rotation forest algorithm.  
The confusion matrix of class -balanced nested dichotomy 
(CBND) is shown in Table 2. In confusion matrix, the 
diagonal element represents the correctly classified instance 
and the others are misclassified.  From class -balanced nested 
dichotomy (CBND) classifier, the kappa statistics were 
found to be 0.918. It is used to measure the arrangement of 
likelihood with the true class.   
The mean absolute error was found to be 0.0438. It is a 
measure used to measure how close forec asts or prediction 
are with the ultimate result. The root mean square error was 
found to be 0.1321. It is a quadratic scoring rule which 
processes the average size of the error. The detailed class  
wise accuracy is shown in Table 3.  
Out of 600 samples, 559 samples are correctly classified 
(93.17%) and remaining 41 are misclassified (6.83%). The 
time taken to build the model is about 0.29 seconds; hence, 
this can use in real time for the fault detection on the wind 
turbine blade.

From class  wise accuracy of class -balanced nested 
dichotomy (CBND)  (Table 3), the properties like  true 
positive rate  (TP), false positive rate (FP), precision, recall, 
F-Measure, Matthews  correlation coefficient (MCC), 
precision -recall curve (PRC) area, receiver operating 
characteristics (ROC) area are determined. TP is also called 
as sensitivity which used to predict t he ratio of positives 
which are correctly classified as faults. FP is commonly 
described as false alarm in which the result that shows a 
given fault condition has been achieved, when it really has 
not been achieved [ 20-23]. The true positive (TP) rate 
shou ld be close to 1 and the false positive (FP) rate should 
be close to 0 to propose the classifier is a better classifier for 
the problem classification [ 24-27]. In the class -balanced 
nested dichotomy (CBND), it shows that the TP near to 1 
and FP close to 0,  then one can predict that the classifier we 
build for the particular problem is very much effective for 
the fault diagnosis problem.”

Classifiers  
Precision is the ratio of correctly classified instances for 
those instances that have been classified as positive. “Recall 
is merely equal to sensitivity in which the information 
retrieval is the fraction of the faults that are relevant to the 
query that are successfully retrieved. F -measure is defined 
as the e quivalent resistance formed by sensitivity and 
precision positioned in parallel phase [ 28-32]. Matthews‟s  
correlation coefficient (MCC) is used to measure of the 
class of binary classifications. The MCC is in essence a 
correlation coefficient between the o bserved and predicted 
binary classifications; it returns a value between −1 and +1 
[33-37]. Precision -recall curve (PRC) area is used to predict 
the classification properties using precision and recall values [38-44]. It is more or less similar to receiver  operating 
characteristics (ROC). ROC is a graphical representation 
that demonstrates the performance of a classifier as its 
discrimination threshold is varied. ”

VII. CONCLUSION  
The wind turbine is very important in the creation of wind 
energy in everyday life.  This paper displayed an algorithmic 
based clarification of vibration signals for the evaluation of 
the wind turbine b lade conditions.  From the acquired 
vibration data, three model was developed using data 
modelling  technique. These models were tested in 10 -fold 
cross validation. All the classifiers were compared with 
respect to their types and maximum correctly classifie d 
instances were found to be 93.17% for class -balanced nested 
dichotomy (CBND). The error rate is relatively less and may 
be considered for the blade fault diagnosis. Hence, the class 
balanced nested dichotomy (CBND) algorithm can be 
practically used for t he condition monitoring of wind turbine 
blade to reduce the downtime and to provide more wind 
energy.  The methodology and algorithm suggested in this 
paper can be potentially used for any kind of wind turbine 
blade to diagnose the blade fault with minimal modification.
