Abstract: Wind turbines generate clean and renewable
energy for the international market. The most important
aspect of wind turbine maintenance is reducing failures,downtime, and operating and maintenance expenses. This
study aims to detect multiple faults exhibited by wind tur-
bine blades; failures such as cracks (tip crack, mid-spancrack, and crack near the root) were observed in the blades
at diﬀerent locations. The research suggests a new approach,
incorporating vibration signals and machine learning tech-niques to identify various failures in wind turbine blades.The technology of ranking features such as ReliefF algo-
rithms, chi-squares, and information gains was adopted to
discuss a method framework to diagnose several problemsin wind turbine blades, such as cracks in di ﬀerent locations.
The k-nearest neighbors (KNNs), support vector machines,
and random forests are used to classify data based on mea-sured vibration signals. The eight main time-domain fea-
tures are calculated from the vibration signals. The proposed
methodology was validated using four databases. The resultsshowed good classi ﬁcation accuracy in four databases, with
at least three non-conventional features in each database ’s
top nine features of the three classi ﬁcation techniques. The
results also showed that when the ReliefF selection algorithmis applied with the KNN classi ﬁcation algorithm, it generates
the highest classi ﬁcation accuracy under all failure con-
ditions, and the value is 97%. F inally, the performance of
the proposed classi ﬁcation model is compared with other
machine learning classi ﬁcation models, and a promising
result is obtained.Keywords: fault diagnosis, blade crack, machine learning,

1 Introduction
Wind energy generated by wind turbines is becoming
increasingly important as a renewable energy source
worldwide. Wind turbine blades have become increasinglycommonplace in recent years due to intense wind loads
and material-level defects in composite systems. To pro-
duce the maximum power possible, turbine manufacturershave extended the length of turbine blades, often con-structed of composite materials. Because turbine blades
account for 15 –20% of the total cost [1
,2], it is indispensable
to monitor the structural health of the blades. Repairingblade damage is one of the most expensive processes in
wind turbines [3]. The failure of a blade when it occurs can
cause substantial secondary damage to the wind turbinesystem due to rotational imbalance. Therefore, research on
monitoring wind turbine blades is of utmost importance.
Monitoring techniques aim to establish whether the mon-itored part performs the required functions, such as pro-viding the power output as planned. It is impossible to
schedule maintenance actions in advance when there is
not enough information on the types of faults that occur.Speciﬁc preparations could have been made routinely or
well organized before the fault if more knowledge and
understanding of the ﬂaws had been obtained.
The blades are subject to various failures caused by
numerous environmental factors and massive construc-
tions because they are exposed to air. Vibrations in theblades caused by varying wind speeds, contact with foreign
objects, and various weather conditions (rain, snow, etc.)
result in a delayed rotation or even failure of the turbine,which can impact total production and result in disruption.Due to the massive construction and various operating
conditions, the vibration and the wind turbines ’remote
location are di ﬃcult to assess [4
]. The analysis of vibration

signals is crucial to determine the strength and to detect
and diagnose blade leaf conditions in wind turbines. Dif-ferent fault diagnostic techniques using di ﬀerent mea-
sured variables, such as vibration [4], acoustic and noise
emission [5], electrical current [6], characteristics of thegenerated power curve [7], etc., and signal processing,
such as time domain, frequency domain, and wavelet ana-
lyses, to check the health of wind turbines (such as blades,structure, gearbox, bearings, electrical generator, etc.) and
develop a maintenance plan [8]. Data-driven approaches to
condition monitoring involve four fundamental steps indiagnosing wind turbine blades, gearbox, and bearing faultpatterns: signal capture and conditioning, feature extraction,
feature selection, and classi ﬁcation [9]. The signal can come
from things such as vibration [10 –13], thermal infrared
[14], acoustic emission signals [14,15], and current [16].
Conditional monitoring includes two methods: tradi-
tional and machine learning-based methods. Traditionalmethods are used when there is no change in the frequency
component over time. The rotating machine generates non-
stationary signals since the frequency components changedue to operating speed and wear and tear changes. Hence,
using the traditional approach of automation systems is
very di ﬃcult. Therefore, it is not desirable. In machine
learning methods, algorithms can continuously learn andadapt to di ﬀerent situations. Consequently, researchers
often resort to machine-learning approaches to diagnose
mechanical system defects [17
].
Various studies have been conducted on diagnosing
wind turbine defects using mac hine learning. Abdulraheem
and Al-Kindi [18 ] conducted a simpli ﬁed investigation of
cracks in wind turbine blades using experimental modal
analysis. In order to simulate the blade of a wind turbine,
step beams were used to study the application of experi-mental method analysis techniques to identify blade failuressuch as crack propagation. Tcherniak and Mølgaard demon-
strated a structural health monitoring system based on the
vibration of the blade of the Vestas V27 wind turbine [19].They developed a plan for the structural health monitoring
system to detect problems such as cracks, openings at the
top and bottom edges of wind turbines, or distortions inwind turbine blades. They simulate the opening of the
blade ’s edge (naturally introduced) and gradually increase
the size from the original 15 to 45 cm. Semi-supervisedlearning algorithms classify it. Sahoo et al .[ 2 0 ]s u g g e s t e d
using machine learning techniques, such as K-nearest
neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and deci-sion trees, together with captured vibration signals fromturbine blades. The health conditions were healthy blades,
bent blades, cracked blades, and eroded blades. Accordingto the results, SVM had the highest identi ﬁcation accuracy
(87%), followed by the decision tree (82%) and KNN (80.8%).Kusiak et al . [21] developed a data-driven methodology to
monitor wind turbine blade pitch issues. They determined
the relationships between the blade pitch ﬂaws: blade angle
asymmetry and blade angle plausibility. Bagging (72.5%), an
artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) (76.2%), pruning a rule-
based classi ﬁcation tree (75.5%), KNN (73.5%), and genetic
programming (74.7%) techniques were used to conduct the
study. In their analysis, only pitch faults were examined; other
fault types were ignored. Joshuva et al. [22] investigated the
identiﬁcation and location of cracks in wind turbine blades
using vibration signals. Using d ata from piezoelectric acceler-
ometers, the blade reaction is calculated to construct the
models when it is excited. With a multilayer perceptron clas-siﬁer and a computation time of 1.51 s, the maximum number
of correctly identi ﬁed cases was 94.95%. Chen et al .[ 2 3 ]
developed a model to predict wind turbine pitch failure.They acquired a classi ﬁcation accuracy to identify blade pitch
faults. In this investigation, they also investigated pitch defects
on their own. Liu et al. [24] provided a comprehensive over-
view of previous research on similar ﬂaws using naive Bayes,
SVMs, deep learning techniques, and the KNN. The advan-
tages, disadvantages, and pract ical implications of such AII
algorithms were also debated. Another review [25,26] detailedthe algorithm for machine learning to detect machine pro-
blems over the years. They divide intelligent fault diagnosis
algorithms into three categories: (a) traditional machinelearning theories, such as probability-based graph methods,
ANNs, SVMs, KNNs; (b) CNNs, raster networks, and deep
learning theories, such as deep-knowledge networks; and(c) transfer learning theories, such as transfer component
analysis and antagonistic genetic networks. They stated that
almost all of them could be used to diagnose rotatingmachine problems. Both review articles focus on machinelearning methods and cutting-edge techniques for diag-
nosing di ﬀerent mechanical defects rather than errors or
speciﬁc mechanical defects. Sánchez et al . [27] classi ﬁed
gearbox and bearing problems using random forest (RF)
and KNN machine learning techniques; through these, a
methodical structure was discussed to detect various pro-blems in rotating machinery. They estimated 30 time-
domain features of the vibration signal using function
ranking techniques such as relief, information gain (IG),and chi-square. Wang et al. [28] used multichannel convolu-
tional neural networks (MCNN) to detect wind turbine
damage using raw vibration signals automatically. Thisapproach eliminates the need for manual inspection andanalysis, thus improving e ﬃciency and accuracy. MCNNs
extract features from multiple channels of vibration data,2 Ahmed Ali Farhan Ogaili et al.

enhancing the ability to detect and classify various types of
damage. In machine learning, the information held by var-ious features retrieved from signals is a crucial factor.
Researchers employ a feature selection process in numerous
applications to improve classi ﬁcation accuracy. The objec-
tive is to choose the most useful features based on feature
ranking and eliminate irrelevant features to improve classi ﬁ-
cation accuracy with the smallest possible subset of data. Wuet al. [29] used Fisher score and Mahalanobis distance tech-
niques to select the highest-ranked feature to increase
classiﬁcation accuracy. Zheng et al . [30] employed another
feature ranking technique, the Laplacian score, to discoverinformative aspects among the numerous defects. Kappa-
ganthu and Nataraj [31] calculated statistical characteristics
in the time, frequency, and time –frequency domains and
used the mutual information technique to select feature
sets. They discovered that classi ﬁcation accuracy could be
signiﬁcantly improved by using feature ranking techniques.
Therefore, this article compares condition monitoring
indicators to ﬁnd faults, such as cracks, in di ﬀerent loca-
tions. The experimental procedure is discussed brie ﬂy, and
information about the experiment is tested under acceler-
ated fault circumstances at various wind speeds and loads. In
addition, the authors evaluated an experimental method ofblade models for wind turbine blade identi ﬁcation based on
the normal state and three common fault types: the tip of the
b l a d ec r a c k ,t h eb l a d ec r a c ki nt h em i d s p a n ,a n dt h eb l a d e
crack at the root. An intelligent detection system is developedfor wind turbines based on machine learning algorithms. The
blade model for wind turbines is based on four states of ﬁber-
reinforced polymer (FRP) blades.
The article is organized as follows: Section 2
presents
common faults in wind turbine blades. Section 3 presents
the methodological framework for the multi-fault diagnosisof a wind turbine blade using feature ranking methods andmachine learning techniques. Experiments on wind turbine
blades used to test the proposed methodological framework
are described in Section 4. The ﬁndings of the diagnosis
using the feature ranking in the time domain according to
our framework are shown in Section 5. Section 6 indicatesthe outcomes for which a discussion using numbers and
evidence is necessary. Section 7 provides the conclusion.
2 Common faults in the wind
turbine blade
Wind turbine blades are susceptible to damage caused by
both external factors and invisible defects resulting from
manufacturing processes. External factors, including strongwinds, rain, snow, salt fog, lightning, freezing, and storms,directly contribute to blade damage [32
]. Conversely, imper-
ceptible faults caused by manufacturing processes endure
repeated high loads and severe environmental conditionsduring wind turbine installation and operation [33]. The
gradual expansion of these invisible defects can lead to
blade damage, which can be attributed to a combinationof causes due to the blade ’s complex materials and structure
[34]. Manufacturing defects are a common cause of early
blade failures, necessitating qu antifying, disposing, and miti-
gating such defects to safeguard the current and future wind
turbine ﬂe e t[ 3 3 ] .D e f e c t ss u c ha sd r y spots, excess resin, and
delamination can damage the bl ade [35]. Early blade failures
often stem from manufacturing defects, emphasizing theimportance of understanding h ow to measure, address, and
mitigate these issues to ensure wind turbine reliability [35].
Blade damage can range from minor degradation, such ascracks and chips, to more severe problems leading to blade
fracture [33]. Despite the near aerospace quality demands
imposed on wind turbine blades, they are produced at con-siderably lower costs than compa rable aerospace structures.
Blade failures currently rank as the second most critical con-
cern for wind turbine reliability [36]. Figure 1 shows somecommon faults in the wind turbine blades. Various techni-ques have been developed to detect and prevent blade
damage, including computer vision-based approaches, arti ﬁ-
cial intelligence-based image analytics, and ultrasonic non-destructive testing [36]. Structural health monitoring of
wind turbine blades also aids in identifying damage

propagation during fatigue testing. For the wind turbine
industry to create strategies that address manufacturingﬂaws and improve overall reliability, it is crucial to under-
stand the factors that lead to wind turbine blade damage.
Implementing strategies to mitigate blade manufacturingdefects and enhance performan ce is paramount in ensuring
wind turbine systems ’long-term operational e ﬃciency
and reliability.
3 Methodological framework
This section presents the methodological framework uti-
lized for analyzing the vibration signals generated by
wind turbines in various operational conditions. The pri-mary objective is to calculate a single value, known as the
wind turbine blade condition index, which indicates the
turbine ’s overall health. This index can exhibit ﬂuctua-
tions, either increasing or decreasing, as the damage to
the turbine worsens. It is widely recognized that faulty
blades exhibit amplitude modulation at frequencies asso-ciated with speci ﬁc defects. Analyzing the vibration spec-
trum at the characteristic frequency of a defect makes it
possible to detect the presence and location of a fault. Thisapproach forms a crucial aspect of the traditional diag-nostic scheme employed, as depicted in Figure 2
. To assess
the eﬀectiveness of signal characteristics in fault diagnosis,
a ranking stage is employed. Three classi ﬁers, namely RF,
SVM, and KNN, are utilized to estimate the performance of
the best attributes based on the accuracy achieved by eachclassiﬁer. The methodological procedure, as illustrated in
Figure 2, comprises the following steps:
•Signal acquisition and conditioning: vibration signals from
a wind turbine test rig are acquired and conditioned.
•Statistical feature calculation: Eight statistical features
are calculated for each signal, as outlined in Section 5 .
•Feature selection: The three most important features are
selected from the extracted features using three di ﬀerent
ranking techniques.
•Feature ranking: The extracted features are ranked using
the ReliefF algorithm, ChiSquare, and IG.
•Fault classi ﬁcation: The RF, SVM, and KNN classi ﬁers are
utilized for fault classi ﬁcation.
4 Experimental work
4.1 Experimental rig
The experimental test rig used in this study is based on a
wind turbine blade and utilizes the Computer-Controlled
Wind Energy Unit (EEEC) provided by Edibon Equipment,
as shown in Figure 3(a) . It comprises a laboratory-scaled
aerogenerator with a rotor, generator, and computer-con-trolled axial fan. The rig allows air velocity control by
adjusting the rotational speed and o ﬀersﬂexibility in blade
conﬁguration. The set-up includes a stainless steel tunnel
with transparent windows to simulate natural wind condi-
tions, with wind tunnel velociti es ranging from 1.3 to 5.3 m/s.
Figure 2: Fault detection procedure.4 Ahmed Ali Farhan Ogaili et al.
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
The aerogenerator has a diameter of 510 mm and generates
60 W of power with a maximum voltage of approximately
12 V and an operational charging current of 5 A.
In the experimental design, as depicted in Figure 4(b)
and (c) , a piezoelectric accelerometer was employed as a
transducer to capture vibration signals. This sensor iswell-suited for detecting faults at high frequencies and iscommonly used in condition monitoring. The speci ﬁc accel-
erometer model utilized in the study is the PCB Piezotronics
352C65 uniaxial accelerometer; its speci ﬁcation is shown in
Table 1. An adhesive mounting technique was employed to
securely install the accelerometer on the nacelle near the
wind turbine hub, enabling vibration data collection.
A cable connected the accelerometer to the data acquisi-
tion (DAQ) card. The NI USB 4431 DAQ card was utilized in thestudy, featuring ﬁve analog input channels, a sampling rate of
102.4 kS/s, and a resolution of 24 bits. The accelerometers and
the DAQ devices interfaced to a Lenovo laptop equipped withCore i7 CPUs. The DAQ process was facilitated using LabVIEW
software.
4.2 Experimental procedure
Initially, the wind turbine was healthy (without defects);
the accelerometer was used to record the signals. These
signals were captured using the listed requirements:
1. The sample length was established to maintain con-
sistency, and the following factors were also considered.
Statistical measures are more relevant when the number

of samples is large enough. On the contrary, as the number
of samples increases, so does the computation time. According
to the Nyquist sampling theore m, the sampling frequency must
be at least twice the maximum frequency to achieve balance

2. A minimum of 500 samples were collected for each
state of the wind turbine blade, and vibration signals were
recorded using LabVIEW 2020.
The turbine was operated at 240 rpm. The acceler-
ometer is positioned vertically on top of the hub to monitorvibrations ( y-axis), as illustrated in Figure 3(b)
. DAQ is used
to gather vibration signals at a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz and
a sample size of 500. This results in four rotations (240/60 ≈4
rotations per second). The fol lowing faults were simulated
one at a time on the blade. In contrast, the remaining blades
and components remained in good condition, and the rele-vant vibration signals were obtained.
4.3 Intentionally adopted faults
In this research, we created models of wind turbine blades
based on normal conditions and common blade fault states
(cracks with di ﬀerent locations) to discuss the vibration
signals generated by wind turbine blades in various states.The blades in this study were custom-designed by the manu-
facturer of genuine commercia l wind turbines. The blades
were made of FRP, measured 300 mm long, and were solidfrom the inside. Figure 4
shows the three simulated fault
types in addition to the healthy case of the blades used in
this investigation. This study de ﬁnes three fault types such as
Fa: Blade tip crack fault, F b: mid-span crack fault, and F c:
crack near the root fault.
5 Feature extraction and selection
Wind turbine vibration signals are nonlinear, necessitating
appropriate signal processing t echniques for accurate analysis
of component health. This study extracts the vibration signal ’s
features using time-domain signal analysis [38 ]. Signals in thetime domain can be analyzed directly by observing their pat-
terns, simplifying calculation s. The time-domain characteris-
tics are computed directly from the time waveform of the
s i g n a l .T y p i c a l l y ,t i m e - d o m a i n signals contain valuable infor-
mation regarding temporal amplitude changes. Analyzingthese signals is economical, req uiring only fundamental signal
conditioning as preprocessing. The analysis entails visually
examining sections of the time waveform and identifyingany anomalous behavior. However, visual inspection alone
is unlikely to detect defects d ue to multiple components in
machine-generated vibration signals that are di ﬃcult to dis-
tinguish in the time domain.
Consequently, statistical data, known as condition indi-
cators, are gathered and compared to predetermined cri-
teria to determine whether the machine is operating normallyor exhibiting abnormalities. Thes e statistical features are uti-
lized for the fault diagnosis of wind turbine blades. Below is a
brief explanation of these s tatistical features [17
–20,22 –39]:
•Kurtosis: It measures the degree of peakedness or ﬂat-
ness of a distribution. It is calculated by taking the sum of
the fourth power of the deviations from the mean anddividing it by the square of the standard deviation.

calculates the square root of the average of the squaredvalues within a dataset. It is a reliable measure to assess

5.1 Feature selection
Before pattern recognition, selecting features is crucial
because it eliminates loud, redundant, or unnecessary fea-
tures, signi ﬁcantly reducing the number of features. In
most cases, it optimizes classi ﬁcation tasks and improves the
performance of learning algorithms. In the diagnosis proce-
dure, selecting the appropriate f eatures or collecting features
that re ﬂect the device ’s condition is important. It is believed
that a good feature or set of features allows one to distinguish
between normal and abnormal circumstances, enabling trend
analysis while avoiding the impact of other device operatingparameters [36
]. In most cases, selecting features is considered
a dimension-reduction problem. Techniques such as principal
component analysis, multidimen sional scale, factor analysis,
projection search, and kernel Fisher discrimination analysisare used. However, these methods usually produce synthetic
properties greater than the original set, so the reduced set
properties are not of physical importance [37,40]. Fisher ’s
scores, ReliefF algorithms, Wilcoxon ranks, gains ratios,
memetic characteristics selection, chi-squares, and IGs are
used to select relevant characteristics and improve precisionin the diagnosis of mechanical failures [41 –43].
5.2 ReliefF algorithm
ReliefF is a supervised feature classi ﬁcation algorithm [44 ].
It is typically used in data preprocessing to select featuresubsets. ReliefF is based on randomly generating instances,
computing their nearest neighbors, and adjusting a featureweighting vector to provide greater weight to attributes
that distinguish the instance from neighbors of other
classes. It is an extension of the Relief approach (used forbinary classi ﬁcation) that aims to evaluate the quality of
the distinguishing factors of neighboring samples [45]. The
ReliefF algorithm begins by selecting a random instance,followed by a search for the k nearest instances of the
same class. This operation alters a weighting vector ( W)
that gives greater weight to traits that better di ﬀerentiate
between surrounding groups and is de ﬁned by [46]:

where Wfrepresents the weight of the feature f.
5.3 Chi-square ( χ²)
The chi-square statistical optimal feature selection approach
was used to improve prediction accuracy [47 ]. Feature
ranking allows testing to determine whether a speci ﬁcf e a -
ture ’s occurrence and a speci ﬁcc l a s s ’s occurrence are inde-
pendent. Thus, when a feature is independent of the class,
this is discarded [48]. It can be computed as follows:
()∑=−

In this equation, χ² represents the chi-square statistic, and
the summation symbol ( ∑) signi ﬁes that the equation is
computed for each category or cell in the dataset. uj
denotes the observed frequency in each category or cell,
while ujrepresents the expected frequency in each cate-
gory or cell, assuming no association exists between the
variables.
5.4 IG
IG is a crucial metric in machine learning for evaluating
feature relevance in classi ﬁcation tasks [43 –49]. It mea-
sures the reduction in entropy when a feature is known.
The IG for a feature is calculated as the di ﬀerence between
the entropy of the original dataset and the weightedDetecting multiple faults in wind turbine blades  7
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
average of the entropies of the subsets created by splitting
the dataset based on that feature. The equation for IG is
( ) ( ) ((∣ ∣ | |) ( ))=− ×FH DΣ DHIG Dv / Dv , (11)
where IG( F) is the IG for feature F,H(D) is the entropy of
the original dataset, |Dv| represents the number of instances
in each subset, and H(Dv) is the entropy of each subset.
Decision trees use IG to determine feature selection order,selecting features with higher IG as more relevant for accu-
rate classi ﬁcation. Alternative metrics like gain ratio and Gini
index address limitations of IG. Overall, IG quanti ﬁes the
reduction in entropy and aids in identifying informative fea-
tures for classi ﬁcation.
6 Machine learning
This section presents an overview of three prominent
machine learning algorithms commonly employed for fault
classiﬁcation. SVM, KNN, and RF. These algorithms have
demonstrated e ﬀectiveness in various domains, including
fault diagnosis and detection in rotating machinery.
6.1 SVM
SVM is a supervised learning algorithm mainly used forclassiﬁcation and regression. Vapnik described the theore-
tical concepts of SVMs [50
]. Due to its high precision and
good generalizability, some researchers [51,52] have used
SVM to classify mechanical failures in rotating machines,
even if the sample is small. The formulation of the SVM isbased on the principle of minimization of structural risk.For binary classi ﬁcation problems, the aim is to maximize
the margin between the di ﬀerent planes. The maximum
margin to separate hyperplanes ( H
1) can be used to classify
the data sets into the classes to be considered. The equation
ofH1can be written as follows.
·+=xwb 0, (12)
where xis the point on the separator plane (H 1), and wis
the vector on the plane. Normalization of the two-class w
parameters can be represented as
·+≤ − + = −xwb ξ y 1f o r 1 , ii i (13)
and
·+≥+ = +xwb ξ y 1f o r 1 . ii i (14)
By combining Eqs. (13 ) and (14), we obtain the following:(· )+≥ −yxw b ξ 1 ,iii (15)
where ξirepresents the slack parameter.
Due to better generalization capabilities, SVM is of
great interest to academic and industrial societies as analgorithm for fault detection systems.
6.2 KNN
The KNN algorithm is a supervised learning approach usedfor classi ﬁcation and regression tasks. It is a nonpara-
metric model that utilizes training datasets to classify
new samples from test datasets based on nearest-neighbor
criteria [53
]. The algorithm searches for ksamples in the
training set that is closest to the new test sample. Classi ﬁ-
cation is then based on the most prevalent classes among
the nearest neighbors. Given a training set D(x,y) where x
represents a sample and yits corresponding class, and a
test sample z=(x′,y′), the algorithm calculates the distance
between zand all training samples ( x,y)i nDto obtain a list
of nearest neighbors [54]. The class assignment for ycor-
responding to the test sample xis determined by a majority
vote of the neighboring classes.
The class assignment equation can be expressed as
follows:
(( ( ) )( ) ) =∈ =′y Σxy D I v y arg max , , iii (16)
where vrepresents a class label, yᵢdenotes the neighboring
class label, and Iis an indicator function that returns 1 if
the condition in parentheses is true. This equation allowsfor the determination of the class with the highest fre-quency among the neighboring samples.
In some cases, a weighted approach is used to account
for the contribution of each neighboring sample based onits distance from the sample to be classi ﬁed. The weight
factor can be de ﬁned as the inverse square of the distance:
()=′ωdx x1
,. i
i2 (17)
In this manner, the kNN algorithm can be de ﬁned as
follows:

Another important consideration in the kNN algorithm
is the choice of distance metric. The most common distancemetric used is the Euclidean dist ance, but alternative metrics
such as cosine similarity, Minkowski distance, correlation,
and chi-square distance can also be employed [55
].

training samples. The class assi gnment is determined through
majority voting, and a distance metric is used to measure thesimilarity between samples [56
].
6.3 RF
RF is a machine-learning technique introduced by Breiman[57
] that leverages an ensemble of decision trees. By com-
bining the concepts of bagging and random feature selec-
tion, RF aims to address issues related to variance andoverﬁtting. In this approach, each tree in the forest inde-
pendently determines the class for a given sample, and the
ﬁnal class prediction is made through majority voting. The
training data used to construct each tree are referred to asthe “in-bag ”data, while the remaining data constitute the
“out-of-bag ”observations (OOB) [58]. OOBt represents the
OOB sample associated with tree t. The classi ﬁcation error
of the forest, errForest, can be de ﬁned as follows:
{{ } }=∈ ≠nin y errForest1Cart 1, …, , y ̄,ii(19)
whereyirepresents the true class label for the ith sample,
and ȳ_idenotes the majority class predicted by the trees
where the sample iis part of the OOBt. It is important to
note that “Cart ”in the equation may have been intended to
represent a speci ﬁc mathematical function, but its precise
deﬁnition or context is not provided. Further elaboration
or clari ﬁcation is required to ensure an accurate under-
standing and interpretation of the equation.
6.4 Evaluating the machine learning model
Developing a machine learning model is a crucial skill foraspiring data scientists. However, the initial model is rarely
the “best ”model. Evaluating the quality of our machine
learning model is crucial for improving its performanceuntil it reaches its maximum potential. Evaluation metrics
for classi ﬁcation problems compare the expected class label
to the predicted class label or interpret the predicted prob-abilities for class labels. Classi ﬁcation problems are wide-
spread and have numerous applications in the real world,
such as identifying spam emails, targeting marketing, frauddetection, and determining whether a patient is at high risk
of having a particular disease diagnosis. In this blog article,
we examine various categorization evaluation metrics thatcan be applied to issues of this nature.
•Confusion matrix (CM)
The CM is crucial in classi ﬁcation tasks, summarizing
the predicted and observed values. It represents fouroutcome combinations and enables evaluation using pre-
cision, recall, accuracy, F1 score, and area under the curve
(AUC)-receiver operating characteristics (ROC) metrics.
Engineers and professionals in the wind industry rely
on the accuracy and interpretability of the proposedmodel, which is visualized in a table-like format. The
CM provides count values for accurate and inaccurate
predictions, allowing for analysis and decision-making.Overall, the CM is a valuable asset for evaluating classi ﬁ-
cation models in various ﬁelds, including the wind
industry.
•Precision is the number of classi ﬁed correct outputs or
the exactness of the model. It is calculated using the
following equation:
=+T
TFPrecision .p
pp(20)
•Recall: Recall is our model ’s measurement to identify the
real positive. The calculation is done using the followingequation:
=+T
TFRecall .p
pn(21)
•Accuracy: Accuracy is the percentage of production that
is correctly predicted. Measure how many positive and nega-
tive observations were correctly classi ﬁed. Calculations are
made using the following equation:
=+
+++TT
TFFTAccuracy .pn
ppn n(22)
•F1 score: The F1 score is an average of accuracy and
recall. They combine accuracy and memory into a singlemetric by calculating their harmony average. The for-
mula is calculated using the following equation:
=++FT
TFF12
2.p
ppn(23)
•Speci ﬁcity, S, also called the true negative rate, measures
the proportion of negatives that are correctly identi ﬁed,
given by the following equation:
=+ST
FF,n
pn(24)
where Tprepresents actual positive values, Tnrepresents
valid negative values, Fprepresents false positive values,
and Fnrepresents false negative values.
•ROC
The ROC based on the CM is used to evaluate the clas-
siﬁcation. The ROC curve extracts many indices to assess
a classi ﬁer’seﬀectiveness. The region between the ROC
curve and the negative diagonal is the AUC, with a valueDetecting multiple faults in wind turbine blades  9
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
between 0.5 and 1 [59 ,60]. Because there is an area where
the value of R and P is 1 for each cuto ﬀpoint, AUC =1
implies a perfect rating, while AUC =0.5 shows that the
classiﬁer is faulty. The Wilcoxon rank test and AUC ’s sta-
tistical characteristics are equal [61]. The Gini coe ﬃcient
[62] is twice the area between the diagonal and the ROC
curve, and the AUC is also closely connected.
7 Results and discussion
This study aimed to evaluate a methodological framework
to classify features in the multi-fault diagnosis of rotating
equipment using RF, KNN, and SVM classi ﬁers and deter-
mine the importance of non-conventional features in windturbine fault diagnosis processes. The datasets were uti-
lized to test the technique and signi ﬁcance of the four
non-standard characteristics.7.1 Time domain vibration signals analysis
In the present study, the state of the wind turbine blades
included standard blades and blades with various faults.
The wind turbine blades rotated at various wind speedsduring health state detection. The blades rotated at a wind
speed of (1.3 –5.3) m/s, which is compatible with the Iraqi
climb [2
]. Recent research [16 –25] has used vibration sig-
nals extensively due to their e ﬃciency in forecasting di ﬃ-
culties. Using NI LabView signal processing software, accel-
erometer voltage values were collected and converted totime-domain acceleration signals. Figure 5 shows the refer-ence vibration signals of the healthy blade and another
blade with fault condition signals taken when di ﬀerent
cracks in the wind turbine blade at di ﬀerent wind speeds.
They show the vibration signal plot (time vsamplitude) for
a healthy condition blade, Fa (blade tip crack fault), Fb
(blade mid-span crack fault), and Fc (blade root crack

fault), respectively. This gives a basic idea about how the
magnitude of the acquired vibr ation signal varies over time
concerning simulated faults. It was observed that the vibra-
tion signals changed dependin g on wind speed, from Figure 5,
Vwind=1.3 m/s observed the vibration signals in the healthy
case. Normally, a slight vibration would occur during the
operation; therefore, the vibration measure. Therefore, the
observed signals suggested th at the wind turbine was oper-
ating normally. While obser ved, the signals changed and
were a ﬀected by the type of faults. It can be seen that the
signs change signi ﬁcantly compared to the rest of the cases.

7.2 Result of the feature ranking
Eight-time domains are measured from the vibration sig-
nals of the wind turbine. They are input to machine
learning algorithms for fault classi ﬁcation [34 ]. Three fea-
ture ranking algorithms were used to optimize the featureset,viz.the IG Chi-square ( χ²) and ReliefF reduce the order
of the set of features. Table 2 compares the results of the
feature ranking algorithms and shows how the calculatedfeatures are ranked. Variance, standard deviation, and
RMS are the best-ranked features based on IG, and varia-
tion is the most helpful feature. Although using Chi-square(χ²) to rank the characteristics, kurtosis, skewness, and RM
were the most important. The kurtosis value in the time
domain was the most important feature since it shows theaverage power of the measured signal and is given moreweight than the other features.
Furthermore, Table 2 displays the ranked feature list
generated by the ReliefF algorithm, which is utilized todemonstrate further the utility of the feature ra nking method
for fault classi ﬁcation and observed that the standard devia-
tion and the variance and value become the most signi ﬁcant
of the ten measured features. It is observed from Table 2 that
the standard deviation f e a t u r e sa r em o r es i g n i ﬁcant comparedto other time domain features. Where it appears in each
algorithm, the measure of the vibration signal ’s actual
energy or power content is weighted high compared to the
other feature. The same observation is also found in Table 2.
Using the RF-ranked feature set, two classi ﬁers compare the
classiﬁcation accuracy with selected features. In the current
study, the classi ﬁcation of features depends on the time
domain from which the characteristics are calculated andthe weight assigned by the ranking method.
7.3 Result of machine learning
This study focuses on the application of three widely usedmachine learning algorithms, namely SVM, KNN, and RF,
to detect faults in wind turbine blades. Additionally, the
integration of feature ranking techniques, speci ﬁcally IG
(IG), Chi-square ( χ²), and ReliefF, is employed to identify
the most e ﬀective methodology for integrating machine
learning models. The objective is to identify the optimalcombination of algorithms and feature ranking methods
to enhance the accuracy and e ﬃciency of fault detection
in wind turbine blades.
The confusion matrices presented in this study illus-
trate the performance of three di ﬀerent types of machine
learning algorithms, namely KNN, SVM, and RF, in classi-
fying instances into four categories: Fa (crack at tip blade),Fb (crack at mid-span blade), Fc (crack near the blade root),
and H (healthy state). The confusion matrices display the
number of instances predicted for each category and com-pare them to the actual distribution of instances.
Table 3
presents the confusion matrices for the three
machine learning algorithms (kNN, RF, SVM) when applyingthe IG feature ranking method. Each matrix shows thenumber of instances classi ﬁed into di ﬀerent categories: Fa
(crack at tip blade), Fb (crack at mid-span blade), Fc (crack
near the blade root), and H (healthy state). The numbers inthe matrix represent the count of instances correctly classi-
ﬁed and misclassi ﬁed for each category. For example, in the
kNN CM, there are 963 instances of Fa correctly classi ﬁed,
482 instances misclassi ﬁed as Fb, 202 instances misclassi ﬁed
as Fc, and 453 instances misclassi ﬁed as Healthy.

The Chi-square feature ranking method was employed
as the second approach for fault selection in wind turbine
blades. Table 4 presents the confusion matrices for each
model utilizing the chi-square feature ranking. Within theconfusion matrices, the diagonal elements represent cor-
rectly identi ﬁed instances, while the o ﬀ-diagonal elements
indicate misclassi ﬁcations. In this context, Fa corresponds
to the root crack, Fb denotes the mid-span crack, and FcTable 3: Comparison of the evaluation matrices with other models for Info. gain

represents the crack at the blade ’s tip. The classi ﬁcation
accuracy for the KNN model is 58.4097%, with 583.785instances misclassi ﬁed as Fb and 584.505 instances misclas-
siﬁed as Fc. Outperforming the kNN model, the SVM model
achieves an accuracy of 79.8953% and correctly classi ﬁes
789.53 instances as Fb, yielding an F1 score of 0.798075.
Similarly, the RF model demonstrates strong performance
with an accuracy of 79.8456% and an F1 score of 0.798456.
These ﬁndings emphasize the e ﬃcacy of the chi-square
feature ranking method in accurately identifying faults in
wind turbine blades. The kNN model exhibits moderateaccuracy but encounters challenges in distinguishingbetween Fb and Fc instances, resulting in a signi ﬁcant
number of misclassi ﬁcations. On the other hand, the
SVM and RF models showcase superior performance in
correctly classifying Fb insta nces. Further investigations
can delve into optimizing these models, re ﬁning feature
selection techniques, and exploring ensemble methodsto enhance the overall accuracy and robustness of the
fault classi ﬁcation systems.
Table 5
displays the results of applying the ReliefF
algorithm to three machine learning models: SVM, KNN,
and RF. Table 5 presents confusion matrices, indicating the
number of instances classi ﬁed into categories representing
blade conditions (H: healthy, Fa: crack at tip blade, Fb: crackat mid-span blade, and Fc: crack near blade root). SVM
achieved accurate classi ﬁcation for Fa in 1,344 instances
but misclassi ﬁed 127 Fa instances as Fb, 108 as Fc, and 521
as H. kNN achieved perfect classi ﬁcation for the Healthystate (H) and accurate Fa classi ﬁcation for 2,083 instances.
RF accurately identi ﬁed Fa (1,997 instances) but misclassi ﬁed
some instances across other states. These matrices provide
valuable insights into the performance of each algorithm, facil-
itating analysis of accuracy and misclassi ﬁcation patterns.
The results obtained from the machine learning models
for wind turbine blade fault detection demonstrate remark-
able advancements in accuracy and precision. The applica-tion of the ReliefF feature ranking method yielded an
impressive classi ﬁcation accuracy of 97%, surpassing the
accuracy reported in the reference [61
], which achieved a
maximum of 94.94% accuracy [22]. Furthermore, the pro-posed hierarchical feature selection approach based on
relative dependency exhibited a remarkable classi ﬁcation
accuracy of 97.08% for gear fault diagnosis, as documentedin the study of Manju et al. [63]. The utilization of multimodal
deep support vectors with homologous features for gearbox
malfunction diagnosis also showcased exceptional perfor-mance, with accuracy exceeding 97% using any of the four
ranking features for the RF and kNN classi ﬁers [63,64].
Comparatively, the precision achieved by these modelsranged from 96.7 to 97%, outperforming the precision
values reported in previous studies [63,64].
Table 6 provides a comprehensive overview of the
precision values obtained by the kNN classi ﬁers, revealing
that the IG feature selection method resulted in the lowest
precision, plunging as low as 54.0649%. Conversely, the
ReliefF feature ranking method consistently yielded thehighest precision and delivered superior results across

all fault classi ﬁcations. Table 6 further supports these ﬁnd-
ings, demonstrating that the IG algorithm yielded thelowest precision value, while the employment of ReliefF
resulted in the highest precision and recall values. These
results are congruent with the F score and AUC metrics,aﬃrming the e ﬃcacy of the ReliefF algorithm for feature
selection in identifying the most critical features and achieving
exceptional precision in fault classi ﬁcation, as corroborated by
prior research [65].
The exceptional precision and accuracy achieved by the
machine learning models, particularly when employing the
ReliefF feature ranking method, signify substantial progressin wind turbine blade fault detection. These ﬁndings signi ﬁ-
cantly contribute to the advancement of fault diagnosis
methodologies and bear vital implications for enhancingwind turbine maintenance strategies and minimizing opera-tional downtime.
8 Conclusion
This research sought to address the crucial aspect of windturbine maintenance by reducing failures, downtime, and
operational expenses. The emphasis was detecting multiple
faults in wind turbine blades, speci ﬁcally cracks at various
locations (tip, mid-span, and near the root). To accomplish
this, a novel method was proposed that combines vibration
signals and machine learning techniques. Within a meth-odological framework, feature ranking algorithms, such as
ReliefF, chi-square, and IG, were used to diagnose blade
failures. The KNN, SVM, and RF classi ﬁers were used to
classify data based on measured vibration signals, consid-ering eight primary characteristics in the time domain. Theproposed methodology was validated using four databases,
and the resulting classi ﬁcation accuracy in all failure con-
ditions was excellent. In particular, the ReliefF algorithm,
in conjunction with the KNN classi ﬁer, achieved a classi ﬁ-
cation accuracy of 97%. This ﬁnding demonstrates the e ﬃ-
cacy of the feature selection algorithm in detecting andclassifying blade failures.
Furthermore, the performance of the proposed classi-
ﬁcation model was compared to that of other advanced
machine learning models, demonstrating its superiority
in fault detection. The ﬁndings provide valuable informa-
tion and contribute to the ﬁeld of fault diagnosis for wind
turbines. The proposed method has the potential to accu-
rately diagnose blade failures with minimal adjustments,
resulting in improved maintenance procedures and tur-bine performance. Future research directions may includereﬁning the methodology, investigating alternative feature
selection algorithms, and examining innovative machine-
learning approaches. These e ﬀorts will advance the diag-
nosis of wind turbine faults, promoting more e ﬃcient and
reliable wind energy harvesting. By minimizing failures
and optimizing maintenance strategies, the industry canmaximize the potential of wind turbines as a renewable
energy source.
