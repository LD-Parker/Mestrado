Abstract: Structural health monitoring (SHM) and the operational condition assessment of blades are
greatly important for the operation of wind turbines that are at a high risk of disease in service for
more than 5 years. Since certain types of blade faults only occur during wind turbine operation, it is
more signiﬁcant to perform in situ SHM of rotating full-scale blades than existing SHM of small-scale
blades or static testing of full-scale blades. Considering that these blades are usually not prefabricated
with relevant sensors, this study performed SHM and condition assessment of full-scale blades in
operation with stereo digital image correlation. A self-calibration method adapted to the outdoors
with a large ﬁeld of view was introduced based on the speckled patterns. To accurately obtain the
in- and off-plane deformation, a new reference frame is constructed at the center of the rotation
of the blades. The 3D displacements of the points of interest (POIs) on the blade of a 2 MW wind
turbine were characterized. Furthermore, the frequency spectrum of the measured 3D displacements
of the blades was compared with the blades with the faults. The results showed that the introduced
technique is a convenient and nondestructive technique that enables SHM of full-scale wind turbine
blades in operation.

1. Introduction
During the past three decades, multiple sources of evidence show that the overuse of
fossil fuels is a major factor in unabated global warming [ 1–3]. Wind energy has attracted
extensive attention as one of the most promising clean renewable energy alternatives to
fossil energy. According to the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC), the total wind power
capacity in the global market reached 837 GW in 2022 [4].
Meanwhile, wind turbines are designed with larger blade diameters to generate
electricity more efﬁciently [ 5]. Moreover, the efﬁciency of power generation efﬁciency
is strongly related with the operating conditions of the blades. Once a blade is faulted,
its structural and aerodynamic characteristics change in a way that reduces the power
generation efﬁciency [ 6–8]. Furthermore, as a critical component of wind turbines, the
manufacturing cost of blades accounts for about 22% of the total cost of a wind turbine.
Without effective techniques for early detection and risk warning of blade micro-defects,
the accumulation of micro-defects can lead to signiﬁcant blade faults [ 9]. If the faulty
blade continues to operate, it can induce the failure of other components of the wind
turbine or even cause a catastrophic accident in the unit. Not only is there a signiﬁcant
cost to maintain the wind turbine, but the power generated during maintenance is also
lost. Therefore, structural health monitoring (SHM) and condition assessment of full-scale
blades are signiﬁcant for sustainability.
Currently, the SHM techniques for blades can be roughly categorized as contact
and non-contact [ 10,11]. The current mainstream contact-based blade fault measurement

methods include strain gauge measurement, vibration measurement, acoustic measurement,
electromagnetic measurement, etc. [ 12–15]. Liu et al. proposed a strain prediction method
for wind turbine blades based on genetic algorithm back propagation neural networks to
investigate the strain prediction methods for full-scale blade static testing [ 16]. It is clear
that the laboratory method of testing full-scale blades ﬁxed on a test bench is not suitable
for wind turbines in operation. In fact, certain types of faults can only be detected when
the wind turbine is in operation, i.e., the germination stage of these types of faults can
easily be missed by shutdown examinations [ 17,18]. In situ detection of the blade faults of
wind turbines in operation is more effective than traditional off-line testing [ 19]. Khazaee
et al. revealed the effect of faulty blades on tower vibration by installing accelerometers
on the tower of a wind turbine to collect tower vibration signals. A convolutional neural
network classiﬁer was developed to categorize the tower vibration collected under blade
health and fault conditions [ 20]. Sun et al. proposed a self-supervised health representation
learning method for SHM of blades, where they accurately monitored blade icing by
mounting accelerometers on the internal blade surface of a wind turbine [ 21]. Both of the
above studies implemented blade fault detection by installing sensors. It is commendable
that they have built convolutional neural network (CNN) models for fault recognition
and categorization. However, the method is difﬁcult to be applied to wind turbines that
are at a high risk of disease in service for more than 5 years due to the absence of pre-
assigned relevant sensors. Overall, contact measurement methods can hardly be used to
measure the motion of large wind turbine blades due to the complexity of the layout and
expensive cost.
Recent advances in photogrammetry provide new opportunities for non-contact SHM
of full-scale blades [ 5,22]. Stereo digital image correlation (stereo DIC) typically uses two
cameras to capture structural images from different perspectives and then uses pattern
recognition techniques to compare these patterns frame by frame to measure 3D displace-
ment, deformation, and motion [ 23,24]. As the main load-bearing component, blade faults
can manifest in its 3D trajectory, and many faults only occur during blade rotation. There-
fore, it is signiﬁcant to prevent the deterioration of blade micro-defects by periodically
performing in situ SHM of the blade to obtain the 3D motion and deformation of the
blade. LeBlanc et al. performed static tests on a 9 m composite turbine blade using stereo
DIC and showed that the technique can be readily expanded to accommodate large-scale
blades [ 25]. Baqersad et al. identiﬁed the mode shapes of a wind turbine blade using the
stereo DIC technique and compared its performance with the ﬁnite element and impact test
approaches [ 26]. Both studies were static tests, as in [ 18]. Wu et al. tested the performance
of the stereo DIC in blade fault examination with prefabricated faults in the blades of
wind turbine models [ 27]. Bharadwaj et al. estimated the full-ﬁeld dynamic strain of wind
turbine blades using the DIC method and compared it with strain gauge measurements [ 28].
Both studies were conducted on small-scale wind turbines and did not really address the
technical problems of full-scale wind turbine SHM. Lehnhoff et al. estimated the aeroe-
lasticity of wind turbine blades based on the deformation measured by the DIC method
and compared the results measured by the Spinner LiDAR method [ 29]. This study pasted
speckle patterns only at the blade tips, while the rest of the blades were not considered. In
summary, most of the existing DIC-based blade fault detection studies are for small-scale
wind turbines or shutdown detection of full-scale wind turbines. Moreover, the apparent
difference between laboratory and operating conditions also hinders the application of the
traditional stereo DIC techniques for in situ SHM of full-scale wind turbine blades.
Due to the uncontrollable testing environment, the application of stereo DIC is still
challenging for in situ SHM and condition assessment of full-scale wind turbine blade
faults in operation. Therefore, this paper performs research on several major challenges,
i.e., camera parameter calibration, reference frame construction, and test system construc-
tion, for in situ SHM of full-scale blades with stereo DIC. An in situ SHM method based on
stereo DIC for operating full-scale blades is proposed. The effectiveness of the introduced
method was veriﬁed by measuring the 3D motion of the blades of an operating 2 MW wind

ing image frame as 𝑂ଵ−𝑋 ଵ𝑌ଵ𝑍ଵ  and 𝑜ଵ−𝑢 ଵ𝑣ଵ , respectively. Similarly, 𝑂ଶ−𝑋 ଶ𝑌ଶ𝑍ଶ  and 
𝑜ଶ−𝑢 ଶ𝑣ଶ represent the camera 2 frame and its image frame. The world frame is set to 
align with the frame of camera 1. The relative  pose of the two cameras can be represented 
as rotation matrix R and translation vector t, respectively. Assume that any point of inter-
est (POI) P has coordinate ሺ𝑥௪,𝑦௪,𝑧௪ሻ under the world frame, and the coordinates of it

DIC and perspective projection model and ( b) the matching strategy of POIs.  
The gray gradient of the subset determines the performance of the correlation match-
ing algorithm. In the case of a mismatch, a non-negligible error is introduced in the 3D 
reconstruction of the POIs. Therefore, for e ﬃcient matching performa nce, the sample sur-
face is usually sprayed with arti ﬁcial speckles [31]. As shown in Figure 3b, both cameras 
capture a set of images 𝑖𝑚𝑔 ଵ_଴ and 𝑖𝑚𝑔 ଶ_଴ simultaneously as reference images at the be-
ginning of loading. During the loading process, the cameras capture the deformation im-
ages 𝑖𝑚𝑔 ଵ_ଵ~𝑖𝑚𝑔 ଵ_௡ and 𝑖𝑚𝑔 ଶ_ଵ~𝑖𝑚𝑔 ଶ_௡ of the specimen at the same frame rate. First, the 
image coordinate 𝑝ଵ_଴ of the POI P in the image 𝑖𝑚𝑔 ଵ_଴ is given, and its coordinates 𝑝ଶ_଴ in 
image 𝑖𝑚𝑔 ଶ_଴ are estimated using the correlation ma tching algorithm. Then, the coordi-
nates 𝑝ଵ_ଵ~𝑝 ଵ_௡ and 𝑝ଶ_ଵ~𝑝 ଶ_௡ of the POIs in the deformed image are determined sequen-

2.2. Stereo Camera Extrinsic Parameter Calibration 
Since the intrinsic parameters 𝑨ଵ  and 𝑨ଶ  depend on the camera’s sensor and lens, 
they can be pre-calibrated in the laboratory  based on Zhang’s method [35]. Extrinsic pa-
rameters R and t calibration based on the scene cont rol points can be divided into epipo-
lar-based and homography-based methods. Both methods require su ﬃcient control 
points uniformly distributed in the ﬁeld of view. The former requires that the control 
points have depth variation, while the la tter requires that the control points be coplanar. 
In this study, speckle pa tterns attached to blades can be used as control points for the 
calibration of extrinsic parameters. It is clear that the homography-based method is more 
suitable for the application scenario of this st udy. Theoretically, the control points are not 
strictly coplanar due to wind load and blade self-weight. In practice, the control points 
can be considered as approximately coplanar du e to the long distance of the cameras from 
the wind turbine and the slight depth  variation of the control points. 
The homography of the projection points of the spatial points in the two views can 
be described in Figure 5. Assuming that P is any point on the spatial plane π, the normal-
ized coordinates of the image points of its projection in the two perspective views are

In theory, H with 8 degrees of freedom can be ca lculated by 4 sets of corresponding 
points [36]. In practice, the corresponding po ints do not strictly satisfy the relation 𝑝ଶ=
𝑯𝑝 ଵ due to image noise. Therefore, hundreds of correspondences with  sub-pixel accuracy 
were used to calculate H in this study. Perform a singular value decomposition of the 
homography matrix H:

gular values of the matrix H. The diagonal matrix Λ can be decomposed as:

According to Equation (8), we can obtain up to 8 different solutions for the triplets:

It is clear that not all of these 8 solution s are physically possible. Several constraints 
have been introduced to determine the unique solution [37]. 
For the measurement system in Figure 2, since the two cameras are mounted on sep-
arate mounts, possible ground vibrations or wind loads during measurements can inval-

in each deformed image pair, and the extrin sic parameters were updated with the fast 
extrinsic parameter re-correction algorithm in [38]. Once the re ﬁnement of 𝐑 and 𝐭 is de-
termined, the 3D coordinates of the spatial point can be estimated via the triangulation

2.3. Construction of the Reference Frame 
The 3D deformation of the blades measured by stereo DIC depends on the chosen 
reference frame [39]. For 3D photogrammetry, the reference frame (world frame) is 
aligned with the left camera frame by default. This con ﬁguration results in the in- and o ﬀ-
plane deformation of the specimen not bein g measured accurately. Therefore, it is

2.3. Construction of the Reference Frame
The 3D deformation of the blades measured by stereo DIC depends on the chosen
reference frame [ 39]. For 3D photogrammetry, the reference frame (world frame) is aligned
with the left camera frame by default. This conﬁguration results in the in- and off-plane
deformation of the specimen not being measured accurately. Therefore, it is necessary to
establish a new reference frame on the specimen surface before loading. Since there is no
coplanar orthogonal line on the blade surface, ﬁtting a reasonable reference plane is the key
to establishing the reference frame.
As shown in Figure 6, image points ( 3,white points ) are selected on the specimen
surface, and their 3D coordinates in the left camera frame are calculated based on the
calibrated stereo camera parameters. According to the 3D coordinates (X1n,Y1n,Z1n,),
a reference plane can be ﬁtted to construct a reference frame Or XrYrZr. The displacement
in the Zrdirection is the out-plane displacement and the XrandYrdirections are the in-
plane displacement components. Equation (10) represents the function of the reference
plane where the reference frame is located [40].

3.1. Experimental Setup
In this experiment, the blades of an operating 2 MW wind turbine with a length of
47 m were tested. Since the coating of the blade’s surface is pure white, it causes the
images of the blades captured by the stereo cameras to lack the gray gradient necessary
for correlation matching. Therefore, we pasted random speckle patterns with a size of
4040 cm on the pressure side of the blades before the test, as shown in Figure 7a.

According to the schematic in Figure 2, a measurement station of the test system con-
structed in this study is shown in Figure 7b . The imaging system consists of a CMOS cam-
era (Mikrotron 25CXP, Unterschleißheim, Germany) with a spatial resolution of 5120 × 5120 pixels and a lens (Nikkor Lens, Tokyo, Japan) with a focal length of 75 mm. The pixel 
size is 3.45 µm pixel
−1. The baseline length of the stereo DIC was 63.9 m. The position of 
the camera can be adjusted through the a ttitude control unit, avoiding the inconvenience 
of manually adjusting the camera posture. Du e to the high resolution and frame rate of 
the images, a high-speed image card (Active Si licon FireBird, Langley, UK) with a transfer 
rate of 6.25 Gbps was built into the computer (Intel Core (TM) i7 CPU @2.4 GHz, Santa 
Clara, CA, USA). All the algorithms are dev eloped in C++ as the programming language. 
In addition, we used the open-source library  OpenCV. The measuring system is arranged 
in front of the wind turbine according to the direction of the wind, as shown in Figure 8. 
The distance between the wind turbine and the camera was approximately 250 m. 
The pan-tilt and controller shown in Figure 7b were utilized to adjust the positions 
of the two cameras to ensure that the entire blades were in the ﬁeld of view of both cam-
eras. When one of the blades is approximat ely perpendicular to the ground, the stereo 
camera starts capturing images of the wind turbine in operation. The stereo camera cap-
tured images of 560 pairs of blades over 5 rotation cycles.

Determining the parameters of the stereo camera is one of the most important steps 
in the tests of the SHM of wind turbine blades. The process of calculation is shown in 
Figure 9. Before the in-site measurement, the intrinsic parameters of the two cameras were 
pre-calibrated using Zhang’s method [35]. To es timate the extrinsic parameters of the ste-
reo camera, six pairs of images were selected as calibration images from the capture im-
ages mentioned above. The control points ar e extracted and matched using the SIFT algo-
rithm from the speckle pa tterns of the blade’s surface in the calibrated images. About 4000 
pairs of control points are retained and used to calibrate the extrinsic parameters of the 
stereo camera according to the method introduced in Section 2.2, as shown in Figure 10. The intrinsic and extrinsic parameters are listed in Table 1.

To realistically illustrate the 3D trajectory of the blades, a reference frame was con-
structed at the center of rotation of the wind turbine in this study. Figure 11 shows the
cabin portion of the ﬁrst wind turbine image captured by the left camera. Several image
points were arbitrarily selected on the contour of the front circular cover of the wind turbine
cabin. The image coordinates of these image points in the corresponding right view can
be determined by the DIC method. Since the extrinsic parameters of the stereo camera
have been determined, the 3D coordinates of the image points in the left camera frame can
be estimated. The 3D coordinates can be used for ﬁtting a reference plane. The origin of
the reference frame is located at the center of the reference plane. And then, the reference
frame Or XrYrZrcan be constructed according to the method described in Section 2.3.

It should be noted that according to the reference frame shown in Figure 11, the x-direction
displacements represent horizontal motion, the y-direction displacements represent vertical
motion, and the z-direction displacements represent off-surface motion. It can be observed
that as the POIs are far away from the rotational center of the blade, the magnitude of the
motion in each direction increases gradually. This is consistent with the motion law of
the blade. Taking POI 5 as an example, its peak displacement in the y-direction is about
40 m, which is basically consistent with the distance between the point and the center of
rotation of the blade. This sufﬁciently demonstrated the effectiveness of the reference frame
construction method.

tation angles of the POIs in the right view over time for ﬁve cycles. The pixel displace-

The 3D coordinates of the POIs can be reconstructed according to the determined 
image coordinates of the POIs in the deformed image and the stereo DIC parameters, 
where the 3D coordinates are represented in the camera 1 frame. Then, these 3D coordi-

and ( c) rotation angles.
In addition, the motion amplitude of the POIs over ﬁve rotation cycles is approximate.
This indicates that the wind speed and direction were relatively stable during the test
period, and the wind turbine blades were in orderly operating condition. It should be noted
that the off-surface displacement is caused by inertial and aerodynamic loads during blade
rotation. In this case, the z-direction motion trajectories of the POIs close to the blade root
approximate a sinusoidal curve, while the motion trajectories of the POIs close to the blade
tip are more disorganized. This is due to the fact that the deﬂection of the blade tip is much
larger than the blade root in the operating condition, and the forces are more complicated.
Transforming displacement signals to the frequency domain using fast Fourier trans-
form (FFT) is one of the most common methods in blade fault diagnosis [ 41]. Therefore,
the raw data were transferred to time frequency in this study to be considered as the fault
indicators. As an example, the 3D motion of POI 5 was analyzed with Fourier transform,
as shown in Figure 15a–c. In contrast, small-scale wind turbine blades with prefabricated
faults were tested in the laboratory in another of our studies, as shown in Figure 15d [ 42].
Figure 15e presents the results after transforming the 3D displacements of the cracked blade
measured in the operating condition to time frequency using FFT. It can be found that there
is only one fundamental frequency signal in the frequency domain corresponding to the
3D displacements measured in this study, while there are multiple fundamental frequency
signals for the 3D displacements of the blade with faults. This further veriﬁes that the wind
turbine blades shown in Figure 12 were in healthy operating conditions.

The factors a ﬀecting the measurement accuracy mainly include image resolution, 
FOV size, FOV angle, system parameters, etc., in which the ﬁrst three factors are closely 
related to the con ﬁguration of the stereo DIC system. To accommodate the size of the 
blades, a high-speed CMOS camera  with high resolution was used to ensure the clarity of 
the captured images. For an ideal FOV angle, the two cameras were arranged at a distance 
of 63.9 m apart, which facilitated the 3D reco nstruction of the POIs. In addition, for con-
venience in ﬁeld environments, each camera was ﬁtted with an inclinometer and a pan-
tilt to assist in adjusting the camera’s a ttitude. 
The accuracy and e ﬃciency of calibration of the extrinsic parameters of the stereo 
camera are crucial for in situ SHM of a full-sca le wind turbine in operation. The former is 
closely related to the reliability of the measured blade’s motion, and the la tter determines 
the convenience of the testing. To improve th e robustness of the self-calibration method

4. Discussion
The factors affecting the measurement accuracy mainly include image resolution,
FOV size, FOV angle, system parameters, etc., in which the ﬁrst three factors are closely
related to the conﬁguration of the stereo DIC system. To accommodate the size of the
blades, a high-speed CMOS camera with high resolution was used to ensure the clarity
of the captured images. For an ideal FOV angle, the two cameras were arranged at a
distance of 63.9 m apart, which facilitated the 3D reconstruction of the POIs. In addition,
for convenience in ﬁeld environments, each camera was ﬁtted with an inclinometer and a
pan-tilt to assist in adjusting the camera’s attitude.
The accuracy and efﬁciency of calibration of the extrinsic parameters of the stereo
camera are crucial for in situ SHM of a full-scale wind turbine in operation. The former is
closely related to the reliability of the measured blade’s motion, and the latter determines
the convenience of the testing. To improve the robustness of the self-calibration method for
large FOV applications, this paper enhances the number and quality of scene control points
by pasting spackle patterns on the blades, and the homography constraint is employed as a
calibration principle to accommodate the spatial characteristics of the blades. Experimental
results showed that the introduced method can efﬁciently and accurately estimate the
extrinsic parameters of the stereo DIC for large FOV applications. The method of pasting
the spackle patterns in the shutdown condition of the wind turbine has the disadvantage of
high cost. As a suggestion, some markers can be created during the manufacturing process
for large wind turbines.
For most of the studies, the reference frame is aligned with the left camera frame. This
leads to the fact that the existing studies only obtain the trend of the blade motion, and the
measured values are not reliable for the real deformation of the blade. In this study, the in-
and off-plane displacements of the blades were accurately measured by constructing a new
reference frame at the rotation center of the blades, which is important for the assessment
of the operational condition of the blades. In fact, it is more appropriate to construct the
reference frame at the blade’s root. Unfortunately, there is no available reference plane for
the blade’s root in this test. In addition, since it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd a full-scale wind turbine
with a disordered operating condition, this study used the motion frequency spectrum of a
prefabricated fault small-scale wind turbine blade as a reference to verify the validity of the
proposed techniques.
By analyzing the 3D displacement and frequency spectrum shown in Figure 14, it can
be clearly identiﬁed that the measured blade is in good operating condition. According
to Figure 15, it is known that the introduced technique can diagnose the presence of
damage in the blade. The results of the analysis showed that the technique can serve as
a reliable tool for SHM and the operational condition assessment of blades of full-scale
wind turbines. Since the technique can detect potential blade damage in time, more critical
blade or turbine accidents can be avoided. This is signiﬁcant for the efﬁcient utilization of
wind energy and sustainability. It is also potentially helpful for the SHM of other outdoor
engineering structures.
5. Conclusions
This study performed in situ SHM of full-scale wind turbine blades in operation
and provided solutions to several challenges with existing technologies. A test system
was constructed to accommodate the full-scale wind turbines. Given the difﬁculty in
determining the pose relationship between cameras when applying the stereo DIC with
a large FOV outdoors, control points for determining the camera poses are provided by
pasting speckle patterns on the pressure side of the blades. A self-calibration method based
on scene control points is introduced, and its effectiveness is veriﬁed by reconstructing
the size of the pattern with a known geometric. To accurately obtain the in- and off-plane
deformation of the blades, a new reference frame is constructed at the center of rotation of
the blades.

An experiment was conducted to evaluate the operational condition of the blades
of a 2 MW wind turbine. Eight POIs were selected at roughly equal intervals from the
root to the tip of the blade. The experimental results showed that the displacements of
the POIs in each direction over ﬁve rotational cycles approximated sinusoidal curves
with the same amplitude. To further evaluate the operational condition of the blades, the
frequency spectrum of the measured 3D displacements of the blades was compared with
the blades with the faults. The results show that the proposed method is a convenient and
nondestructive technique that enables online assessment of the operational condition of
full-scale wind turbine blades.
The frequency spectrum of 3D motion can only distinguish whether the blade opera-
tion is orderly or not; it is not able to further identify the cause of disordered operation. In
fact, different types of blade damage correspond to different 3D motion trajectories, which
were not investigated more thoroughly in this study. In addition, the measurement errors
caused by light refraction, illumination variations, and communication delays need to be
considered. In the next step, we plan to incorporate the blade’s 3D motion data into a deep
learning model to accurately identify and locate blade faults.
