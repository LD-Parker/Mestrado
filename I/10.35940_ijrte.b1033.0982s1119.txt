 Abstract --- Wind energy is one of the essential renewable 
energy resources because of its consistency due to the 
development of the technology a nd relative cost affordability. The 
wind energy is converted into electrical energy using rotating 
blades which are connected to the generator. Due to 
environmental conditions and large construction, th e blades are 
subjected to various faults and cause the lack of productivity. The 
downtime can be reduced when they are diagnosed periodically 
using condition monitoring technique. These are considered as a 
machine learning  problem which consists  of three p hases, 
namely feature extraction, feature selection and fault 
classification. In this study, statistical features are extracted from 
vibration signals, feature selection are carried out using J48 
algorithm and the fault  classification was carried out  using  
logistic model tree algorithm. ”

I. INTRODUCTION  
In recent years, wind energy becomes the most demanded 
resource in power generation. Because of worldwide 
ecological contamination due to other resources, the 
sustainable energy and natural resources like wind energy 
have risen [1]. “Wind energy is one of the efficient 
renewable sources and an alternative option for commonly 
used sources. The objective of the wind turbine is to boost 
ideals by extreme energy extraction and in this manner, the 
performance of the wind turbine frequently differs with 
wavering winds. To make wind energy more focused from 
different sources of energy, like perfor mance, accessibility, 
reliability, effectiveness, the life of  turbines must be 
improved [2].  
Generally, horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) is used 
for power generation since it is more effective than the 
vertical axis wind turbine [3]. Most HAWT are with three 
rotor blades typically placed upwind of the tower and the 
nacelle. The nacelle is typically furnished with anemometers 
and a wind vane to calculate the wind rate and direction of 
the wind. The nacelle also contains aviation light signal and

The main objective of condition monitoring method is to 
create the power yield as calculated. When there is an 
awareness of t he time and categories of defects, 
maintenance activities can be arranged ahead of time [5].  
Thus, condition monitoring of blade fault is a critical 
activity. There are two types of approaches which are 
carried out for condition monitoring: traditional ap proach 
and machine learning approach. The traditional approach is 
mainly used for frequency component does n ot change with 
respect to time.  
Rotating machines produce non -stationary signals. Since 
the frequency components change due to wear and tear, fault 
discrimination is very difficult using an automated system in 
the traditional approach. Hence, not preferred. In machine 
learning approach, algorithms have the capability to learn 
continuously and adapt themselves to the varying situations. 
Researchers oft en resort to machine learning approach for 
fault diagnosis of mechanical systems. ” 
Many studies were carried out using machine learning 
studies and simulation studies to name a few, Godwin and 
Peter Matthews [6] have done classification and detection of 
wind turbine pitch faults through SCADA data analysis and 
RIPPER algorithm which yield them 87.05% classification

 Shizhong Zhang et al., [11] carried out a work on design

performance evaluation on the erosion of wind turbine blade 
coatings.  
Xiang Li et al., [12] have carried out a research on crack

made a novel folding blade of wind turbine rotor for 
effective power control using MATLAB and achieved 
maximum reduction of 51.1% in pitch control (Optimum 
fold angles of 550 and 900 ). 
Simon Hoell and Piotr Omenzetter [14] have carried out a 
struc tural damage detection in wind turbine blades based on 
time series representations of dynamic responses using 
vibration data and cross -correlations, principal component 
analysis (PCA), genetic programming (GP) as the diagnostic 
algorithms. ” 
Wang Yongzhi et  al., [15] have carried out a study on a 
composite wind turbine blade aerodynamic and structurally 
integrated design optimization based on radial basis function 
(RBF) meta -model, blade element momentum (BEM) 
theory, finite element method (FEM) and multi -island

“This paper aims to reduce the mass of blade under some 
constraints, including the power and deflection at the rated 
wind speed, and the strength and deflection under the 
ultimate case. P.U. Haselbach et al., [16] studied the  effect 
of delamination on local buckling in wind tur bine blades 
using FEM analysis.  
They simulated by bending the blade in flap -wise 
direction and conducted the experiment. Although numerous 
works were carried out using simulation studies, only a very 
few of the experimental studies for condition monitoring on 
wind t urbine blades were carried out.  
Some researchers carried out fault diagnosis system using 
machine learning approach and they considered very few 
faults in their study.  
Only selected algorithms  were used to perform the fault 
prediction on wind turbine blades and many algorithms are 
yet to be studied [17]. Figure 1 shows the methodology of 
the work done. ” 
The contribution of the present study  
1. This study considers more than two faults for fault 
diagnosis of the wind  turbine (blade crack, erosion, 
hub-blade loose connection, pitch angle twist and 
blade bend).  
2. Vibration signals are taken for the blade using data 
acquisition.

II. EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES  
The main aim of this study is to classify whether the 
blades are in good condition or in a defective state. “If it is 
defective, then the objective is to identify the type of fault. 
The experimental setup and experiment al procedure are 
described in the following subsections.  
Experimental Setup  
The experiment was carried out on a 50W, 12V variable 
speed wind turbine (MX -POWER, model: FP -50W -12V)  
[18]. The technical parameters of a wind turbine are given in 
Table 1. The wi nd turbine was mounted on a fixed steel 
stand in front of the open circuit wind tunnel outlet. The 
wind tunnel speed ranges from 5m/s to 15 m/s and acts as a 
wind source to start the wind turbine. The wind speed was 
varied continuously in order to simulate  the environmental 
wind condition. The experimental setup is shown in Figure 
2. Piezoelectric type accelerometer was used as a transducer 
for acquiring vibration signals. It has high sensitivity for 
detecting faults. Hence, accelerometers are widely used i n 
condition monitoring. In this case, an uniaxial accelerometer 
of 500g range, 100 mV/g sensitivity, and resonant frequency 
around 40 Hz was used.

 The piezoelectric accelerometer (DYTRAN 3055B1) was 
mounted on the nacelle near to the wind turbine hub to 
record the vibration signals using an adhesive mounting 
technique. It was connected to the DAQ system  through a 
cable. The data acquisition system (DAQ) used was NI USB 
4432 model. The DAQ card has five analogue input 
channels with a sampling rate of 102.4 -kilo samples per 
second with 24 -bit resolution. The accelerometer is coupled 
to a signal conditionin g unit which consists of an inbuilt 
charge amplifier and an analogue -to-digital converter 
(ADC). From the ADC, the vibration signal was taken. 
These vibration signals were used to extract features through 
feature extraction technique. One end of the cable is plugged 
to the accelerometer and the other end to the AIO port of 
DAQ system. NI – LabVIEW was used to interface the 
transducer signal and the system (PC).  
 
Figure 2 : Wind Turbine Setup  Experimental Procedure  
In the present study, three -blade variable horizontal axis 
wind turbine (HAWT) was used. Initially, the wind turbine 
was considered to be in good condition (free from defects, 
new setup) and the signals were recorded using an 
accelerometer. These signals were recorded with the 
following specificati ons. 
1. Sample length: The sample length was chosen 
long enough to ensure data consistency; and also 
the following points were considered. ARMA 
measures are more meaningful when the number of 
samples is sufficiently large. On the other hand, as 
the number of samples increases the computation 
time increases. To strike a balance, a sample length 
of 10000 was chosen.  
2. Sampling Frequency:  The sampling frequency 
should be at least twice the highest frequency 
contained in the signal as per Nyquist sampling 
theorem. B y using this theorem sampling 
frequency was calculated as 12 kHz (12000Hz).  
3. Number of samples:  Minimum of 100 (hundred) 
samples were taken for each condition of the wind 
turbine blade and the vibration signals were stored 
in data files.

 corresponding vibration signals were acquired. Figure 3 
shows the different blade fault conditions which are 
simulated on the blade.  
a) Blade bend (BB):  This fault occurs due to the 
high-speed wind and complex forces  caused by the wind. The blade was made to flap wise bend with 
10 º angle.  
b) Blade crack (BC -2): This occurs due to foreign 
object damage on the blade while it is in operating 
condition. On the blade, 15mm crack was made.  
 
  
 
  
 
  
Figure 4:  Vibration Signal Plot  
c) Blade erosion (BE):  This fault is due to the 
erosion of the top layer of the blade by the high -
speed wind. The smooth surface of the blade was 
eroded using emery sheet (320Cw) to provide an 
erosion effect on the blade.  
d) Hub -blade loose contact:  This fault generally 
occurs on a wind turbine blade due to an excessive 
runtime or usage time. The bolt connecting the hub 
and blade was made loose to obtain this fault.  
e) Blade pitch angle twist (PAT):  This fault occurs 
due to the stress on the blade caus ed by high -speed 
wind. This makes the pitch get twisted, creating a heavy vibration to the framework.  To attain this 
fault, blade pitch was twisted about 12º angle with 
respect to the normal blade condition.  
In Figure 4, the vibration signals (sample numb er vs. 
amplitude) are shown which were taken for different 
conditions of the wind turbine blade (good condition blade, 
blade bend, blade erosion, hub -blade loose connection, 
blade crack and pitch angle twist).

 III. FEATURE EXTRACTION – STATISTICAL 
ANALYSIS  
The vibration signals were acquired for good and other 
faulty conditions of the blade. If the time domain sampled 
signals are given directly as inputs to a classifier, then the 
number of samples should be constant. “The number of 
samples obtained which are the  functions  of rotation of the 
blade speed. Hence it varies with speed. Also, the number of 
digitized data points in a signal is too large; generally the 
work of classifiers may not handle it efficiently. Therefore, 
a few features must be extracted before t he classification 
process. Descriptive statistical parameters [1 9] such as sum, 
mean, median, mode, minimum, maximum, range, 
Skewness , kurtosis, standard error, standard deviation and 
sample variance were computed to aid as features in the 
feature extracti on process.  
IV. FEATURE SELECTION - J48 ALGORITHM  
J48 decision tree algorithm is adapted from the C4.5 
algorithm in WEKA [ 20]. “It consists of a number of 
branches, one root, a number of nodes, and a number of 
leaves. One branch is a chain of nodes from the ro ot to a 
leaf, and each node involves one attribute. The occurrence 
of an attribute in a tree provides information about the 
importance of the associated attribute [ 21]. A decision tree 
is a tree based knowledge representation methodology used 
to represent classification rules. J48 decision tree algorithm 
is a widely used one to construct decision trees [ 22]. The 
procedure of forming the decision tree and exploiting the 
same for feature selection is characterized by the following:  
1. The set of features availab le at hand forms the 
input to the algorithm; the output is the decision 
tree.  
2. The decision tree has leaf nodes, which represent 
class labels, and other nodes associated with the 
classes being classified.  
3. The branches of the tree represent each possible 
value of the feature node from which they 
originate.  
4. The decision tree can be used to classify feature 
vectors by starting at the root of the tree and 
moving through it until a leaf node, which provides 
a classification of the instance, is identified.  
5. At each decision node in the decision tree, one can 
select the most useful feature for classification 
using appropriate estimation criteria. The criterion 
used to identify the best feature invokes the 
concepts of entropy reduction and information 
gain.  
Inform ation gain measures how well a given attribute 
separates the training examples according to their target 
classification. The measure is used to select the candidate 
features at each step while growing the tree [ 23]. 
Information gain is the expected reducti on in entropy caused 
by portioning the samples according to this feature.  
Information gain ( S, A ) of a feature A relative to a 
collection of examples S, is defined as:  
         (1) 
where Value (A)  is the set of all possible values for 
attribu te A, and Sv is the subset of S for which feature A has value v. Note the first term in the equation for gain is just 
the entropy of the original collection S and the second term 
is the expected value of the entropy after S is partitioned 
using feature A. The expected entropy described by the 
second term is simply the sum of the entropies of each 
subset Sv, weighted by the fraction of samples | Sv|/|S| that 
belong to Sv. Gain (S, A ) is, therefore, the expected 
reduction in entropy caused by knowing the value  of feature 
A. Entropy is a measure of homogeneity of the set of 
examples and it is given by  
    (2) 
where, c is the number of classes, Pi is the proportion of  S 
belonging to class  „i’.   
The J48 decision tree algorithm has been applied to the  
problem of feature selection. The input to the algorithm is 
the set of statistical features described above and output of 
the decision tree shown in Figure 5. It is clearly shown that 
the top node is the best node for classification. The other 
features in  the nodes of decision tree perform in descending 
order of significance. It is to be mentioned here that only 
features that contribute to the classification appear in the 
decision tree and other features do not contribute much. The 
features which have the less discriminating capability can be 
consciously discarded by deciding on the threshold. This 
concept is made use for selecting good features. The 
algorithm identifies the good features for the purpose of 
classification of the given training data set, and  thus reduces 
the domain knowledge required to select good features for 
pattern classification problem [24 -26]. Referring from 
Figure 5, one can identify the most dominating features to 
represent the blade conditions are the sum, range, standard 
deviation,  and kurtosis.  
 
Figure 5: J48 Tree Classification for Feature Selection  
V. FEATURE CLASSIFICATION - LOGISTIC 
MODEL TREE (LMT) ALGORITHM  
A logistic model tree essentially comprises a normal 
decision tree arrangement with logistic regression tasks at 
the leave s [27]. “As in normal decision trees, an assessment  
on one of the qualities is connected with each internal hub. 
For an identified property with k values, the hub has k child 
hubs, and illustrations are sorted down one of the k branches 
relying upon their estimation of the feature. For numeric 
features, the hub has two child hubs and the test comprises

 of contrasting the characteristic significance to the 
threshold. Generally, a logistic model tree comprises of a 
tree arrangement that is comprised of an a rrangement of 
internal or non -terminal hubs N and an arrangement of 
leaves or terminal hubs T. Let S indicate the entire 
occurrence in space, spread over by all characteristics that 
are available in the information [2 8]. At that point,  the tree 
structure g ives a separate section of S into areas St, and each 
area is characterized by a leaf in the tree.  
 
       (3) 
Not like all decision trees, the leaves t ∈ T has a related 
logistic regression function ft rather than only a class name. 
The regression function ft considers a subset Vt⊆V of all 
characteristics existing in the data and models the clas s 
relationship possibilities as

VI. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
The vibration signals were ac quired for good condition 
and faulty blade conditions using DAQ (total 600 samples 
were collected; 100 samples for each condition). From 
vibration signals, twelve descriptive statistical features were 
extracted. Out of them, four best contributing features  were 
selected using J48 decision tree algorithm. They are the 
sum, range, standard deviation, and kurtosis. From Figure 5, 
the feature „sum‟ is the most contributing features when 
compared to other features. The other contributing features 
are a range, st andard deviation, and kurtosis.  
The minimum number of instances per leaf and the 
number of data used for reduced -error pruning was kept at 
50 for selecting 4 dominating feature in J48 decision tree 
algorithm. The rest of the features like mean, median, mo de, 
minimum, maximum, skewness, sample variance and 
standard error were eliminated as they contribute very less 
in fault classification. With the selected features, the fault 
classification process was carried out using logistic model 
tree. The classificat ion accuracy of LMT algorithm using 
WEKA software package was found to be 90.33% with the 
minimum number of instances to be 20 and the logitboost 
iteration to be -2. The confusion matrix of the logistic model 
tree algorithm is shown in Table 2. In confusio n matrix, the 
diagonal elements represent the correctly classified 
instances and the others are misclassified instances [2 9]. 
Also one can observe more misclassifications between good 
and loose conditions. For the loose condition, the bolts 
between the hub  and the blade were made loose (please note 
that the blade was in good condition). However, at high 
wind speed, the blade can stick to the hub and behave like a 
good condition during operation. Because of this, the 
signature of the loose condition sometime s resembles good 
condition and the classifier finds difficult to distinguish 
between them; hence, more misclassifications.  From logistic model tree (LMT), the kappa statistic was 
found to be 0.884. It is used to measure the arrangement of 
likelihood with t he true class.  The mean absolute error was 
found to be 0.0496. It is a measure used to measure how 
close forecasts or prediction are with the ultimate result 
[30]. The root mean square error was found to be 0.1621. It 
is a quadratic scoring rule which pro cesses the average size 
of the error. The detailed class  wise accuracy is shown in 
Table 3. The class  wise accuracy is expressed in terms of the 
true positive rate (TP), false positive rate (FP), precision, 
recall, F -Measure, receiver operating characteris tics (ROC) 
area [31-34]. 
TP is used to predict the ratio of positives which are 
correctly classified as faults. FP is commonly described as a 
false alarm in which the result that shows a given fault 
condition has been achieved when it really has not been 
achieved. The true positive (TP) rate should be close to 1 
and the false positive (FP) rate should be close to 0 for a 
better classifier [ 35-41]. One can observe from table 3, the 
TP rate of most of the classes are close to 1 and FP rate were 
close to 0. Th is reassures that the result presented by 
confusion matrix in Table 2.

From 600 samples, 542 samples are correctly classified 
(90.33%) and remaining 58 are misclassified (9.67%). The 
time taken to build the  model is about 0.23 seconds. This 
can be used in real time for the condition monitoring of the 
wind turbine due to low c omputational time.  
The logistic model tree algorithm is a better classifier that 
can be used in multiclass fault prediction on wind tur bine

 VII. CONCLUSION  
The wind turbine is very important in the production of 
wind energy in the day to day life.  This paper presents an 
algorithmic based clarification of vibration signals for the 
assessment of wind turbine blade conditions. “From the  
acquired vibration data, a model was developed using data 
modeling  technique. LMT algorithm was used to learn and 
classify the different conditions of the blade. The model is 
tested under 10 -fold cross validation and correctly classified 
instances were  found to be 90.33%. The error rate is 
relatively less and may be considered for the blade fault 
diagnosis. Hence the logistic model tree can be practically 
used for the condition monitoring of wind turbine blade to 
reduce the downtime and to provide uninterr upted wind 
energy.
