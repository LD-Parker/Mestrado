Abstract  18 
Wind power is becom ing one of the most important renewable energies in the world. The 19 
reduction in operating and maintenance costs of the  wind  turbines has been identified as one of 20 
the biggest chal lenges to establish this energy as an alternative to fossil fuels. Predictive 21 
maintenance can detect a potential failure at an early stage reducing operating costs.  Structural 22 
Health Monitoring together  with Non-Destructive Techniques are an effective method to detect 23 
incipient delamination in wind turbine blades . Ultrasonic guided waves offer possibilities to 24 
inspect delamination and disunion between layers in compos ite structures. Delamination results 25 
in a concentration of tensions in certain areas near the fault, which can propagate and create the 26 
total break of the blade.  This paper presents a new approach for disunity detection between layers 27 
comparing two real bl ades, also new in the literature , one of them  built with three disbonds 28 
introduced in its manufacturing process.  The signals are denoised by Daubechies wavelet 29 
transform. The  threshold for the de -noising is obtained by a wavelet coefficients selection rule 30 
using the Birgé -Massart penalization method. The signals were normalized and their envelopes 31 
were obtained by Hilbert transform. Finally, a pattern recognition based on correlations was 32 
applied.  33

1. Introduction . 2 
The challenge for the future is to get a cheap source of energy, non-polluting, renewable and 3 
accessible to all countries in the world, allowing to reduce dependence on fuels to households, 4 
industries and transportation.  Wind power is being one of the main energy sources globally. Its 5 
importance in the energy market is essential , and all the studies show  that this trend will continue 6 
in the near future. The evolution of wind energy over the last 15 years suggest s that its importance 7 
will continue to grow in the future  1. Figure 1 shows the annual installed wind power capacity in 8 
the world from 2001  to 201 7. 9

 12 
Wind Turbines  (WT)  are typically subject to high and varying loads, as well  as extreme weather 13 
conditions. Consequently, the operational unavailability of WTs reaches 3% of the lifetime of a 14 
WT. The operation and maintenance costs can be 10%-20% of the total cost of energy for a wind 15 
farm, and it can reach 35% for a WT at the end of life  3.  16 
It is necessary a high degree of maintenance to provide a safe, cost -effective, and reliable power 17 
generation. This is even more critical for offshore wind farms , where WT cannot be reached 18 
during adverse weather condit ions. 19 
Structural health monitoring (SHM) is employed  to analyse  the condition  of a structure  4-6. It is 20 
usually considered as part of a predictive maintenance strategy 7-9. The objective is to extend the 21 
life cycle of the analysed system and prevent the triggering of critical failures , resulting in  less 22 
cost and downtime s.  23 
75% of the annual downtime in WTs is caused by only 15% of the failures  10. It is more relevant 24 
to install the SHM  in critical  structural  components  that cause  larger  downtime s instead  to the 25 
components that present  more failure rate  11. Haln et al.  12 present  the average failure rate and 26 
downtime per component  for a WT . Figure 2 shows that the failure of the blades occupies the 27 
fourth position in terms of unavailability time in a WT.  28 
 29 
Figure 2 Failure rates and downtime s from two large surveys of European WTs over 13 years.  30 
 31 
SHM can be  used to determine the optimum equilibrium to set corrective  and scheduled 32 
maintenance strategies in WTs  10,13,14. Maintenance approaches in WT industry can be classified 33 
into three main groups:  34 
• Corrective maintenance : The reaction is initiated after the failure occurs.  35 
• Preventive maintenance : The operative period of a WT is around 20 years 12,15, and most 36 
of the failures are predictable using time -based strategies.  37 
• Predictive maintenance . This strategy is based on the co ndition of the WT. It is possible 38 
to detect faults  in an early stage  by the structural condition of the parts of the machine 39

 The proposed methodology is applied for predictive maintenance for fault detection in the blades , 1 
e.g. surface c racking, disbonds, scuffing, pitting, etc. All the information analysed by the system 2 
is obtained through non -destructive techniques using transducers.  3 
The main propose of this paper is to identify, by SHM techniques  combined with signal 4 
processing methods , delamination in blade structure s, being the approach new according to the 5 
state of the art . 6 
There are several non -destructive techniques for inspecting  WT blades, e.g. visual inspection, 7 
thermography 17,18, detection of acoustic emission s produced by a breakage of fiberglass 19-21 and 8 
conventional ultrasonic inspection  20,22-25.  9 
The technique  showed in this paper  uses ultrasonic guided waves for inspection. It has been 10 
proven successfully in detecting faults  in this type of material . It could be integrated into the 11 
SCADA system in the wind farm , and they could be complementary to other condition monitoring 12 
systems  26.  13 
1.1. Wind turbine blades . 14 
Blades are  generally  made with sandwich materials formed by composite skins and a core of 15 
lightweight materials and isotropic. The need to manufacture blades with a complicated geometry, 16 
low weight and adequate mechanical properties , has driven to choose  these materials. It presents 17 
high resistance to the fatigue , and  low thermal expansion and thermal conductivity.  In addition, 18 
to increase the size of the blades creates new problems related with the loads and str esses 27,28. 19 
A composite material is formed by long and straight fiber s located within a matrix that surrounds 20 
and binds the fibers . Laminates are made by superimposed layers of fibers in the thickness 21 
direction  29. The material properties depend on the orientation, stacking sequence and physical 22 
properties of these fibers.  23 
Sandwich structures are composed by two outer skins covering a m aterial that is lightweigh t, 24 
called core. Th is scheme provides characteristics of high rigidity and lightweight. The core is 25 
thick compared to the outer skins , and it has lower density. The core function is to prevent  relative 26 
movement of the skin  30. 27 
Most manufacturers use  blades with polymeric matrix composite  because it has  lower prices  and 28 
maintaining the structural properties . The e -glass is the most used fiberglass.  Epoxy resins are 29 
generally  used due to its mechanical properties . 30 
The manufacturing process of the WT blades is a delicate process, because these blades support 31 
a continuous fatigue , that can cause stress concentration in areas with discontinuities  31. 32 
 33 
1.2. Inspection with Ultrasonic Guided Waves . 34 
 35 
The ultrasonic waves are mechanical waves that travel through an elastic medium (liquid, solid 36 
or gaseous)  with frequenc ies over 20 kHz. A wave is generated when a particle is disturbed and 37 
vibrates around its equilibrium position, then it is displaced and returns to its position. The 38 
oscillatory motion is transmitted to the adjacent particles initiati ng the wave movement  32.   39 
In thin structures with two surfaces , e.g.  plates or shells, the energy of the wave is confined in its 40 
thickness, allowing the waves  to propagate further. Th ese properties are used to detect  structural 41 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

 damage s. The waves generated in these structures are called Lamb and Shear Horizonta l (SH) 1 
waves, depending of the motion of the particles regard ing to the wave propagation direction.  They  2 
are useful tool for the detection of defects , e.g.  as cracks, disbonds, changes in the thickness , 3 
etc.33-39 4

2. Properties of the wind turbine blade s employed in the test . 6 
The structures studied  are tw o glass -fibre composite Wind Turbine Blades  (WTB) , one of them 7 
with 3 disbond areas between skin -honeycomb. The  WTBs  were built by the manufacturer 8 
Encocam . The blades are identical  (Figure 3),  but in the manufacturing process of one of them 9 
were introduced some elements to generate debonding between their layers. The purpose is to 10 
simulate delamination and debonding between layers  in one of the WTBs , that entails a reduction 11 
in the performance of the blade.  12

The configuration of the layers is shown in  Figure 5 . The composite is Glass Reinforced Plastic 23 
(GRP), that is a composite  of tough resilient , durable plastic resin, and glass fibres of high 24 
strength. The resin employed is Epoxy resin. The laminate thickness is 4.6 mm with a tolerance 25 
of ± 0.5 mm. The numbe r of layers used varies according to the area of the blade. The latching 26 
zone has 18 layers  for increased strength , the transition zone (widening) has 12 layers , and the 27 
rest of the structure  has 6 layers  of fiberglass.  28

 The honeycomb employed is Aluminium honeycomb 4.5 1/8 5052.  The honeycomb thickness is 1 
15 mm and the overall sandwich panel thickness is 23 mm  (Figure 6) . 2

2.2. Introduction of defects in the manufacture process of the blade.  6 
Three defects were introduced during the manufacture of the blade to simulate defects in the 7 
manufacture process, that can lead potential fa ilures and large economic costs . The manufacturer 8 
Encocam  inserted three Teflon PTFE nonstick  tapes in the zones sho wn in Figure 7 to create the 9 
delamination and disbanding. The dimensions of the disbonds of A, B and C are 150x150 mm, 10 
100x100 mm and 50x50 mm respectively.  11

3. Experimental setup and S tructural Health Monitoring System  20 
The experimental setup is composed  by an ultrasonic pulse -receiver, two transducers and two real  21 
blades (undamaged and damaged).  The optimal location and number of the MFC sensors have 22 
been studied in the last few years 40-42. Lamb waves are a type of guided waves that can be easily 23 
generated in structures such as plates or shells  43. It can detect structura l changes inside the 24 
material or on its surface 44. Lamb waves propagation is confined between the two surfaces, and 25 
the attenuation is lower for this type of geometries. In addition, it is assumed to have the influence 26 
of temperature on Lamb wave propagation 45. 27 
The pulse -receiver is Teletest Focus+. It is a Log -Range Ultras onic pulse receiver with 24 28 
independent channels , and output voltage of 300 V peak to peak with improved sampling 29 
resolution and filtering.  The transducers used were Macro Fiber Composites (MFC) 46,47, the 30 
model M2814 -P1 from Smart Ma terial  . 31 
The following procedure has been repeated exactly in both blades, with the aim that the results 32 
are as similar as possible in the areas that are free -faults . The procedure has been performed in 33 
order to identify the areas with delamination in the damaged blade,  where it is analysed regarding 34 
to the same area without delamination of the undamaged blade.  35 
The method employed to collect the ultrasonic signals is pitch and catch. . The MFC  were attached 36 
on the blade surface  (Figure 8 ). A transducer working as transmitter is fixed on the tip of the 37 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

 blade. The position of the MFC transmitter does not change, while the  MFC  receiver is  placed at 1 
different distances sweeping along the blade . The first position of the receiver was 100 mm fro m 2 
the transmitter, and the experiments were done  increasing the distance 100 mm until the 3800 mm 3 
(38 different locations).  4 
 5 
Figure 8 Experimental Setup  and Transducers location on WTBs .  6 
 7 
The signal generated by the emitting transducer was a five cycles sinusoidal shaped signal, 8 
modulated by a Hanning window. At each position, a frequency sweep was deployed from 10  kHz 9 
to 100 kHz, with steps of 5 kHz. The aim of this work is to find evidenc e in the signal that may 10 
determine that there is a fault in the WTB , analysing when the guided waves travel through the 11 
defects.  12 
It was found that the signals containing  more information were the 50 kHz signals. The 50 kHz 13 
signals of the 38 distances were pooled to analyze the correlation between them . Figure 9 shows  14 
the 38 signals from the 38 different locations (X axis) and the z axis shows each sample of each 15 
signal. The Y axis shows the amplitude of each signal, where it is possible to distinguish the 16 
different arrival  of wave front s for each location , as the sensor moves away from the  transmitter.   17

4.1. Wavelet Denoising . 23 
The wavelet transform is a powerful method that allows to identify the local characteristics of a 24 
signal in the time and frequency domain. It presents some advantages that improves the limitations 25 
of resolution and the loss of information presented by the Short -Time Fourier Transform or the 26 
Fast Fourier Transform 48. The wavelet transform uses a variable window size an d adapt it to the 27 
frequency according to the information within the signal is the high or low frequencies. The 28 
resulting signal from low pass filter is the Approximations ( Ai), and the resulting signals from the 29 
high pass filter are the details ( Di) 49. 30 
In the case of the multi -level filte rs (Figure 10), they repeat the filtering process with the output 31 
signals from the previous level, leading the wavelet decomposition trees. Additional information 32 
is obtained by filtering at each level. However, more decompositions levels do not always mea n 33 
better accurate results.  34 
The number of levels was set at seven regarding to the  experiments, where it was found  the highest 35 
percentage of information.  36 
 37

 The Daubechies wavelet family were employed according to reference 50, where it is demonstrated 1 
that they are suitable for this type of signals because they are sensitive to sudden changes, and 2 
they handle with boundary problems for finite length signals, being their biggest advantage over 3 
other families.  4 
The lower wavelet approximation is removed from the original signal to avoid the trend and other 5 
components that appear in the low frequencies (Figure 11).  6 
 7 
Figure 11 Original signals (upper panel) and Wavelet decomposition approximations (lower 8 
panel).  9 
 10 
The denoising of the signals is performed employing a multilevel 1 -D Wavelet analysis using the 11 
Daubechies family. An overly aggressive filtering could eliminate infor mation about the 12 
condition, e.g. small echoes that come from defects. The threshold for the de -noising is obtained 13 
by a wavelet coefficients selection rule using a penalization method provided by Birgé -Massart, 14 
which  produces good results 51-53. Figure 12 shows the original signals, the denoised signals, and 15 
the residual noise extracted by the Wavelet denoising filters. In contrast to other digital filters, the 16 
Wavelet de -noising filter does not produce an unwanted distortion of the characterist ic parameters 17 
of the signals 54,55, e.g. time of flight.  18 
 19 
Figure 12. Residual noise extraction using Wavelet Denoising filter.  20 
 21 
The following signal processing is applied for all the 50 kHz signals of the 38 distances from the 22 
tip of the blade. Each signal is analyzed regarding to  the previous  signal. Th erefore , the incomi ng 23 
signal from  the sensor located at 20  cm to the transmitter is compared with the incoming signal  24 
from  the sensor located  at 10 cm, and the signals at 30 cm is compared with the signal at 20cm, 25 
etc.  26 
The damage in the WTB  should affect to form of the ultr asonic Lamb waves. Hence, if there is a 27 
damage between two adjoining measures, the correlation between both signals should be different 28 
than the correlations between signals in areas without damage.  Figure 13 shows  the filtered signals 29 
at 200 and 210 cm fr om the transmitter.  30 
 31

blade.  33 
 34 
4.2. Envelope and smooth.  35 
The signals were normalized and their envelopes were obtained by Hilbert transform  44. The 36 
Hilbert transform is an approach to study the energy distribution of a signal in the time domain. 37 
The energy envelope  (Figure 15)  was employed  to identify local characteristics of the signal . A 38 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
8 
 new Wavelet denoising filter is applied to smooth the envelope  and to remove small peaks. The 1 
low frequency decompositions (approximatio ns) are selected  (Figure  14).  2

4.3. Correction method.  6 
To highlight the differences between two discrete signals, “damaged” and “health”, a correlation 7 
coefficient can be extracted by Equation 1:  8 
λ𝑥𝑦=𝑁∑x𝑖y𝑖𝑁
𝑖=1−∑x𝑖𝑁
𝑖=1∑y𝑖𝑁
𝑖=1
√𝑁∑x𝑖2−(∑x𝑖𝑁
𝑖=1)2 𝑁
𝑖=1 ∙√𝑁∑y𝑖2−(∑y𝑖𝑁
𝑖=1)2 𝑁
𝑖=1 (1) 
where  λxy is the correlation coefficient of two Lamb wave signals,  𝑥𝑖 and 𝑦𝑖. The length of th e 9 
discrete signals is N samples  56,57. 10 
When a signal is correlated with itself is called autocorrelation  58,59. The autocorrelation  is used 11 
in this paper to identify patterns wi thin a signal, i.e. the periodicity hidden by the noise  12 
(Figure  15).  13 
Figure 15 Autocorrelation of the signals at 200 cm (green signal) and 210 cm (blue signal) from 14 
the tip of the blade.  15 
 16 
The pattern recognition approach is based on the autocorrelation of both signals . Then , the 17 
autocorrelation of one of the  signal s is divided by the autocorrelation of the other  signal to 18 
emphasize the differences and to obtain the ratio curve between them  (Figure 16 ). The singularity 19 
caused  by the induced disbonds in the WTB  is more recognizable in the ratio curve, and its 20 
corresponding  to the location of the damage.  21 
 22

 24 
5. Results.  25 
The maximum values of the ratio curve correspond to the maximum differences between signals. 26 
An automatic identification algorithm that analyzed  the peaks for each pair of signals has been 27 
done . The values of the higher peaks have been registered and they are shown in the Table 3. 28

Figure 17 present s the results of the experiment. The damaged and undamaged  blades  have a 4 
discontinuity in common, that is the start of the sandwich zone. The three induced disbonds in the 5 
“damaged blade” are clearly found in the  sections: 230 -240; 290-300, and; 340-350 cm. It 6 
validates the effectiveness of the approach , where the ultrasonic waves are sensitive to these 7 
changes  in the e -glass material , even at a distance of almost 4 meters.   8

6. Conclusions.  13 
Wind turbine  blades are critical elements , subjected to high loads and stresses , generating  the 14 
disbond between the layers of the composite material. These defects are  points of stress 15 
concentration, and often trigger breakage of the blade. A failure in the wind turbine blades could 16 
cause downtime s, especially in wind farms located in remote areas with difficult access , e.g.  17 
offshore wind turbines, providing considerable economic losses.   18 
The paper proposes a solution for an optimal  structural health monitoring  for wind turbine blade s. 19 
The approach  presented in this paper is able to detect potential failures in the blade in an early 20 
state by employing ultrasonic guided waves.  21 
Two wind turbine blades  were manufactured  to test the method , including three defects in one of 22 
them in the manufacturing process. An ultrasonic transmitter is located in the tip of the blade, and 23 
the sensor is moved along the blade. Then , a signal processing approach is employed to analyze 24 
the guided waves. The approach detect ed the start of the honeycomb within the blade in both 25 
blades , and the three disbonds in the damaged blade. It has been validated that the ultrasonic 26 
guided waves, despite the large attenuation in these composite materials, can determine the 27 
structural health of the blade  at least 4 meters between transmitter and sensor.  This paper  28 
demonstrate s that would be possible to implement in actual wind turbine blades a network of 29 
sensors  strategically arranged to cover the blade, or areas with higher probability of appearing 30 
defects, cracks or disbonds.  31
