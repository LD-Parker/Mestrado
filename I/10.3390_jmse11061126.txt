Abstract: With the increasing installed capacity of wind turbines, ensuring the safe operation of
wind turbines is of great signiﬁcance. However, the failure of wind turbines is still a severe problem,
especially as blade damage can cause serious harm. To detect blade damage in time and prevent the
accumulation of microdamage of blades evolving into severe injury, a damage dataset based on GH
Bladed simulation of blade damage is proposed. Then, based on the wavelet packet analysis theory
method, the MATLAB software can automatically analyze and extract the energy characteristics of
the signal to identify the damage. Finally, the GH Bladed simulation software and MATLAB software
are combined for fault diagnosis analysis. The results show that the proposed method based on GH
Bladed to simulate blade damage and wavelet packet analysis can extract damage characteristics and
identify single-unit damage, multiple-unit damage, and different degrees of damage. This method
can quickly and effectively judge the damage to wind turbine blades; it provides a basis for further
research on wind turbine blade damage fault diagnosis.

1. Introduction
In recent years, with the continuous development of the social economy and the
increasing energy demand, the consumption of fossil energy such as coal, oil, and natural
gas has rapidly caused an energy shortage. New renewable energy can alleviate the energy
crisis, reduce carbon emissions, and improve the social environment [ 1,2]. Wind energy is
one of the leading renewable energy sources. The primary form of wind energy utilization
is captured by wind turbines to generate electricity [ 3]. The global installed capacity is
increasing, and the ensuing problems are also highlighted. Among them, wind turbine
accidents have gradually attracted people’s attention. Blade damage is one of the common
fault types of wind turbines [ 4]. Most of the blades work in a relatively harsh environment.
The blades bear complex environmental wind loads and the unit’s loads. When the wind
load changes suddenly and violently, it is likely to cause the wind turbine blades to ﬂap,
shimmy, and offset [ 5]. Blade manufacturing accounts for about 20% of the total cost [ 6]. If
the blade is damaged, it will not only cause the unit to stop, affecting the power generation
efﬁciency, but also increase the operation and maintenance cost of the wind farm. Therefore,
the study of wind turbine blade damage fault has become one of the research hotspots of
scholars at home and abroad.

At present, the research methods for wind turbine blade damage mainly focus on
installing sensors on the blade, monitoring and data acquisition (SCADA) system, and non-
destructive testing technology. Lyu et al. [ 7] reviewed the research progress of optical ﬁber
sensors in wind turbine blade fault detection. Optical ﬁber sensors have good monitoring
effect. However, when monitoring the running state of the blade through the sensor, the
reliability of the sensor and the cost of installation and maintenance need to be considered.
With the continuous development and improvement of artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms
and communication technologies, SCADA-based systems have been widely used in wind
farms to monitor the operating status of blades. Based on SCADA data, Wang et al. [ 8]
proposed a fault early warning method for wind turbine blade fracture damage monitoring
by constructing a deep autoencoder (DA), which can effectively identify the fracture of the
early warning blade. Although the SCADA system can monitor the operation status of the
entire wind turbine, it needs to deeply mine the data and sometimes rely on experience to
judge the fault. Nondestructive testing technology can effectively ﬁnd and identify damage,
mainly based on strain measurement, acoustic emission, ultrasound, vibration, thermal
imaging, machine vision, and other methods. Du et al. [ 9] reviewed the detection principle
of nondestructive testing technology, their respective advantages and disadvantages, and
future research directions. Taking pictures by UAV belongs to a kind of machine vision
method; LM et al. [ 10] used wind turbine blade pictures to study an efﬁcient and accurate
wind turbine blade damage detection and fault diagnosis monitoring method. The results
show that this method can improve the health monitoring system of wind turbine blades
and improve fault detection accuracy. Similarly, to quickly and efﬁciently identify and
detect damaged image data from wind turbine blades, Guo et al. [ 11] proposed a hierarchi-
cal recognition framework for wind turbine blades. The framework consists of Haar and
AdaBoost algorithm and convolutional neural network (CNN) classiﬁers. The results show
that the method has good robustness and recognition speed. Although the wind turbine
blade image based on UAV can effectively detect the blade surface damage, this method
still requires a certain cost and consumes manpower and material resources. Blade dam-
age simulation based on software simulation can quickly, efﬁciently, and cost-effectively
diagnose blade faults. Aiming at the problem of wind turbine blade pitch angle installation
fault, Wang et al. [ 12] simulated a single blade of a 5 MW wind turbine on land through
GH Bladed software and proposed a fault identiﬁcation method of wind turbine blade
pitch angle installation. This method can accurately identify wind turbine blade pitch
angle installation fault. Feng et al. [ 13] proposed a new method to detect blade damage
using wavelet packet energy spectrum analysis and working modal analysis. The modal
parameters of the blade section are obtained using the working modal analysis method,
and the damage is located according to the modal strain energy change ratio (MSECR).
Finally, the results are veriﬁed by the online fault diagnosis platform integrated with MAT-
LAB. The results show that the proposed method can accurately diagnose and locate the
damage. In order to study the change law of structural frequency caused by blade damage,
Gu et al. [ 14] studied it from two aspects of ﬁnite unit simulation and experimentation. The
results show that the natural frequency of the blade is affected by the damage location,
damage size, and blade speed.
The most effective and commonly used method for wind turbine blade damage fault
diagnosis in actual operation is still manual observation. Therefore, a reliable and accurate
online damage diagnosis method is urgently needed. In this study, GH Bladed software
is used to simulate blade damage. In Section 2, the main performance parameters of
the wind turbine and the important parameter settings of GH Bladed are introduced.
Unlike SCADA systems, GH Bladed is a reliable wind turbine simulation software that can
simulate blade faults and obtain fault information without requiring much data. Then, the
fault simulation process is introduced in Section 3. In Section 4, the characteristic parameter
energy is extracted by a wavelet packet for damage identiﬁcation. Finally, blade damage
identiﬁcation detection is realized. Although this study can quickly and accurately identify
and diagnose whether the wind turbine blade is damaged, this study still has certain

limitations. There is a certain difference between the simulated blade damage based on GH
Bladed software and the real blade damage. In addition, the applicability of the method
of joint fault diagnosis using GH Bladed simulation software and MATLAB software still
needs to be widely veriﬁed.
2. Calculation Method
2.1. Overview of Wind Turbines
The wind turbine blade is one of the critical components of the wind turbine. The
blade captures the wind energy to convert the kinetic energy into mechanical energy, which
drives the generator to generate electricity. This paper uses the horizontal axis wind turbine,
the rated power as P= 2 MW, the wind wheel is three blades upwind, the diameter as
D= 80 m, the hub height as h= 61.5 m, and the unit level IIA. The cut-in wind speed of
the unit is Vin= 4 m/s, the rated wind speed Vr= 12 m/s, and the cut-out wind speed
Vout= 25 m/s . This paper uses the 2 MW demo wind turbine model ﬁle for research. The
main parameters of the wind turbine are shown in Table 1.

2.2. Wind Turbine Grade
The design standard of the wind turbines in this paper adopts IEC61400-1 [ 15,16], in
which the wind turbine grade is IIA, and the turbulence expectation Irefcorresponding to
IEC61400-1 is 0.16. The basic parameters of the wind turbines are shown in Table 2.

2.3. Calculation Software
The load calculation software used in this paper is GH Bladed 4.3, a comprehensive
software developed by GL Garrad Hassan for wind turbine performance and load calcula-
tion [ 17]. GH Bladed can not only simulate the operation state of different types of wind
turbines, but also simulate various faults of wind turbines. In addition, GH Bladed can
calculate and simulate various performances and loads of wind turbines and has been
widely used in engineering practice. In GH Bladed, parameters such as wind turbine
blades, blade airfoils, impellers, towers, generators, nacelles, control systems, and wind
models can be set.

2.4. Wind Speed Simulation
The operating state of this paper occurs under random wind excitation, so the wind
ﬁeld model is characterized by random wind load acting on the wind turbine blades, and
the wind speed needs to be simulated ﬁrst. When the wind turbine is in the operating
environment, the wind ﬁeld model acting around the blade is characterized by instanta-
neous wind speed. By constraining the X direction along the wind direction, the Z direction
perpendicular to the wind direction and upward along the axis of the wind turbine tower,
the three-dimensional coordinates of the right-handed Y direction perpendicular to X and
Z, the wind spectrum type is selected as the Kaimal model, the 3D turbulent wind ﬁle is
then generated according to the IEC 61400 standard.
2.5. Wind Turbine Blade Parameter Setting
The blade model is the primary data of software simulation calculation. The blade
data directly affects the simulation calculation results, so the model must be accurate. Blade
data is generally provided by the blade factory, including blade distance from the blade
root position, chord length, twist angle, relative thickness, pitch axis position, and airfoil
section, here, only the airfoil section number was selected, speciﬁc airfoil data is in the
‘Aerofoil submenu entry’.
In the actual operation of the wind turbine, the deﬂection change of the wind turbine
blade can obtain information through the sensor. In addition, the wind turbine’s voltage,
current, and generator torque are important index parameters for monitoring the regular
operation of the wind turbine, and these characteristic parameters are easy to obtain during
monitoring. Therefore, this paper initially selects blade deﬂection, wind turbine voltage,
current, and generator torque as characteristic parameters for identifying blade damage. In
order to eliminate factors such as instability in the initial operation of the wind turbine, the
initial operation time is 7 s, the actual operation time is 600 s, the time interval is 1 s, and
the total operation time is 607 s. At the same time, to clearly show the damage difference,
the middle operation period is selected as the result display, in which the blade deﬂection
is 306–310 s, and the generator torque and wind turbine current are 302–306 s.
The research method of this paper ﬁrst inputs the characteristic parameters of wind
turbine blades, the generated wind ﬁles, and damage information into GH Bladed software,
then selects the damage characteristic parameters, calculates the damage dataset, and
ﬁnally inputs the dataset into MATLAB software. The wavelet packet analysis damage
dataset is used to extract energy characteristics, and the wind turbine blade damage fault
diagnosis is realized; the research ﬂow chart is shown in Figure 1.

3.1. Simulating Blade Damage Failure 
The GH Bladed software is used for simulation, and the 2 MW wind turbine model 
is provided according to the software to si mulate the blade damage. The blade is divided 
into ten units, each of which can be set separately. The research shows that when the blade 
is damaged by cracks and cracking, its structural sti ﬀness will also change [18,19]. There-
fore, it is feasible to simulate the blade damage by se tting the sti ﬀness parameters, and the 
diﬀerent decrease percentage of the same unit sti ﬀness simulates the di ﬀerent damage 
degree here. The damage degree is de ﬁned as a, the stiﬀness before and after the damage 
is E and  E*:

In the blade se tting module, there are mainly four se tting units: blade information, 
blade geometry, mass and sti ﬀness, and additional mass information that needs to be 
added. The blade information includes blade length, installation angle, pitch angle, blade airfoil data, and whether it is frozen. The blad e geometry can be set according to the initial 
setting. The main parameters are length, chord,  torsion angle, thickness, etc. The main 
parameters set in this paper are the blade mass and sti ﬀness unit. This paper speculates 
two kinds of damage conditions: single-unit damage and multiple-unit blade damage. 
Single-unit damage simulation: the ﬁrst unit is selected to simulate blade root damage,

provided according to the software to simulate the blade damage. The blade is divided into
ten units, each of which can be set separately. The research shows that when the blade is

In the blade setting module, there are mainly four setting units: blade information,
blade geometry, mass and stiffness, and additional mass information that needs to be
added. The blade information includes blade length, installation angle, pitch angle, blade
airfoil data, and whether it is frozen. The blade geometry can be set according to the initial
setting. The main parameters are length, chord, torsion angle, thickness, etc. The main
parameters set in this paper are the blade mass and stiffness unit. This paper speculates
two kinds of damage conditions: single-unit damage and multiple-unit blade damage.
Single-unit damage simulation: the ﬁrst unit is selected to simulate blade root damage, the
ﬁfth unit is used to simulate middle blade damage, and the tenth unit is used to simulate
blade tip damage. Multiple-unit damage simulation: one unit, ﬁve units, and ten units are
selected for simultaneous damage. According to IEC 61400-23 standard and the German

classiﬁcation society wind turbine standard certiﬁcation guide [ 20,21], slight damage is
deﬁned as a change in blade stiffness of not more than 10%, and there is no apparent visible
crack or other damage traces; medium damage is deﬁned as a change of blade stiffness
between 10% and 20%, and some small cracks, wear, or deformation may appear. Severe
damage and extreme damage are more than 20% of the blade stiffness change, and there
are visible cracks, wear, or deformation damage marks, which may even lead to blade
fracture or failure. In summary, the degree of damage in this paper divides damage into
four categories: mild, moderate, severe, and extreme. Minor damage is deﬁned as 90% of
the initial stiffness, and moderate, severe, and extreme damage is deﬁned as 80%, 60%, and
50% of the initial stiffness, respectively.
3.2. Analysis of Damage Characteristics
Blade deﬂection: in this paper, the deﬂection damage of a single-unit blade is simulated
to obtain Figure 2, blade deﬂection change with time. It can be seen that the damage to the
root and tip of the blade does not change signiﬁcantly, and the damage to the middle part
of the blade increases with the degree of damage. The deﬂection change is more prominent,
and the offset is larger. Then, the simultaneous damage of multiple units is simulated; by
simultaneously damaging the ﬁrst unit, the ﬁfth unit, and the tenth unit, and measuring the
positions of the three units at the same time, the deﬂection change of the blade in Figure 3
changes with time, and the deﬂection change of the blade gradually increases with the
increase of the degree of damage. In addition, the damage from multiple units has more
obvious changes than from a single unit. The more signiﬁcant deﬂection change shows that
the damage of multiple units has a more signiﬁcant impact on the blade, which is also in
line with the actual blade damage.

 simulate blade tip damage. Multiple-unit damage simulation: one unit, ﬁve units, and ten 
units are selected for simultaneous damage. According to IEC 61400-23 standard and the 
German classi ﬁcation society wind turbine standard certi ﬁcation guide [20,21], slight 
damage is de ﬁned as a change in blade sti ﬀness of not more than 10%, and there is no 
apparent visible crack or other da mage traces; medium damage is de ﬁned as a change of 
blade sti ﬀness between 10% and 20%, and some sm all cracks, wear, or deformation may 
appear. Severe damage and extreme damage are more than 20% of the blade sti ﬀness 
change, and there are visible cracks, wear, or  deformation damage marks, which may even 
lead to blade fracture or failure. In summary, the degree of damage in this paper divides 
damage into four categories: mild, moderate, severe, and extreme. Minor damage is de-ﬁned as 90% of the initial sti ﬀness, and moderate, severe, and extreme damage is de ﬁned 
as 80%, 60%, and 50% of the initial sti ﬀness, respectively. 
3.2. Analysis of Damage Characteristics 
Blade de ﬂection: in this paper, the de ﬂection damage of a sing le-unit blade is simu-
lated to obtain Figure 2, blade de ﬂection change with time. It can be seen that the damage 
to the root and tip of the blade does not change signi ﬁcantly, and the damage to the middle 
part of the blade increases with the degree of damage. The de ﬂection change is more 
prominent, and the o ﬀset is larger. Then, the simultaneous damage of multiple units is 
simulated; by simultaneously damaging the ﬁrst unit, the ﬁfth unit, and the tenth unit, 
and measuring the positions of the three units at the same time, the de ﬂection change of 
the blade in Figure 3 changes with time, and the de ﬂection change of the blade gradually 
increases with the increase of the degree of  damage. In addition, the damage from multi-
ple units has more obvious changes than  from a single unit. The more signi ﬁcant de ﬂec-
tion change shows that the damage of multiple units has a more signi ﬁcant impact on the 
blade, which is also in line with the actual blade damage.

Figure 3. Deﬂection variation of multiple-unit blade damage: ( a)x-axis, ( b)y-axis.
Generator torque: When the blade is damaged, the wind wheel drives the transmission
bearing to produce periodic vibration, which affects the generator torque [ 22]. As shown in
Figure 4, the generator torque of single-unit and multiple-unit blade damage varies with
time. It can be seen that the damage of multiple units is more evident than that of single-
unit blades. In addition, overlap occurs due to the inﬂuence of generator torque ﬂuctuation.

4. Data Analysis Based on Wavelet Packet
4.1. Formatting of Mathematical Components
The wavelet packet transform analysis is a signal processing technology developed
from the traditional orthogonal wavelet transform, which improves the deﬁciency that the
traditional wavelet transform can only analyze the low-frequency part of the signal and
cannot analyze the high-frequency band at the same time. The wavelet packet transform
analysis can ensure the adaptive and translation characteristics of the window function and
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

distinguish the different frequency bands in the signal simultaneously. The low-frequency
part and the high-frequency part can be processed. This method can effectively ensure the
integrity of each detail and edge information of the signal [23,24].
After wavelet packet decomposition, the signal will get independent frequency in-
tervals, and the energy distribution between each interval is different. Research shows
that the energy distribution of each frequency interval obtained after the decomposition of
the signal containing the fault is different from that of the standard signal. Therefore, the
energy of each frequency interval can be extracted and compared. The speciﬁc process of
extracting feature vectors is as follows:
(1) Firstly, the appropriate basis function is selected to decompose the signal Sinto n
layers, and the signal is decomposed into 2nfrequency bands; i,jdenotes the jnode of
the n layer, i= 1, 2, . . .,n;j= 0, 1, 2, . . ., 2n 1;Xi,jrepresents the wavelet packet
decomposition coefﬁcient of the jfrequency band. The decomposition coefﬁcients
of each low-frequency and high-frequency part of the n layer are reconstructed, and
Si,jis used to represent the reconstructed signal corresponding to each frequency
band coefﬁcient Xi,jto ensure that it satisﬁes the formula. Then, the energy of each
sub-band is solved. Let Ei,jbe the frequency band energy corresponding to Si,j:
Ei,j=ZSi,j(t)2dt=å2n 1
j=1Xi,j2
(2)
(2) Finally, each sub-band can be obtained to get the vector T, the feature vector:
T=[Ei,0+Ei,1+Ei,2, . . . , Ei,2n 1] (3)
4.2. Signal Energy Feature Extraction and Analysis
According to the basic principle of wavelet transform and wavelet packet analysis and
reconstruction, the wavelet packet function used in this paper is sym4 [ 25], the sampling
frequency is 128 Hz, the decomposition layer is made of three layers, and the wavelet packet
analysis and reconstruction model is established and programmed in the mathematical
software MATLAB. The x- and y-axis deﬂection characteristics are selected for signal energy
feature extraction, and the energy feature differences between the typical blade and single-
unit damage and multiple-unit damage are compared. As shown in Figures 6–9, compared
with the typical blade, the energy of single-blade damage and multiple-unit damage is
concentrated in two frequency bands, which can clearly distinguish the standard blade
from the damaged blade. In addition, compared with single-unit damage, multiple-unit
damage energy is more concentrated in the ﬁrst frequency band energy, and the energy
value accounts for a more signiﬁcant proportion. The results show that wavelet packet
analysis can quickly identify standard blades and damaged blades, detect the occurrence of
damage in a timely manner, and avoid more serious accidents caused by the accumulation
and evolution of blade damage.

5. Conclusions 
Based on GH Bladed software, this paper simulates blade damage, single and multi-
ple-unit damage, and sets di ﬀerent damage degrees for comparison. GH Bladed can ini-
tially simulate unit damage in di ﬀerent parts and then select a speci ﬁc damage. The char-
acteristic parameters of wind turbine operation change. Finally, the signal energy charac-
teristics are extracted by wavelet packet change. 
(1) GH Bladed selected di ﬀerent characteristic parameters, and the damage changes 
of three di ﬀerent parts of the blade root, the middle part of the blade, and the tip were 
compared. The damage to the blade’s middle pa rt and multiple units’ simultaneous dam-
age signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuenced the change of characteristic parameters. 
(2) Based on wavelet packet analysis of signal data, the energy percentage of the typ-
ical blade is signi ﬁcantly smaller than that of the damaged blade in the ﬁrst frequency 
band. In addition, the energy percentage of the ﬁrst frequency band of the multiple-unit 
damaged blades is higher than that of the single damaged blades, which can aid in the 
identi ﬁcation of regular blades and damaged blades, single-unit damage, and multiple-
unit damage.

5. Conclusions
Based on GH Bladed software, this paper simulates blade damage, single and multiple-
unit damage, and sets different damage degrees for comparison. GH Bladed can initially
simulate unit damage in different parts and then select a speciﬁc damage. The characteristic
parameters of wind turbine operation change. Finally, the signal energy characteristics are
extracted by wavelet packet change.
(1) GH Bladed selected different characteristic parameters, and the damage changes
of three different parts of the blade root, the middle part of the blade, and the tip were
compared. The damage to the blade’s middle part and multiple units’ simultaneous damage
signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the change of characteristic parameters.
(2) Based on wavelet packet analysis of signal data, the energy percentage of the typical
blade is signiﬁcantly smaller than that of the damaged blade in the ﬁrst frequency band. In
addition, the energy percentage of the ﬁrst frequency band of the multiple-unit damaged

blades is higher than that of the single damaged blades, which can aid in the identiﬁcation
of regular blades and damaged blades, single-unit damage, and multiple-unit damage.
