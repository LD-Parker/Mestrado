1. Introduction
GlobalwarmingisamongthemostsigniÔ¨Åcantglobalproblems.Inthisregard,thedevelopment
ofrenewable energy sources (RESs) is important in protecting the environment. First, given the
excessively high CO2 emissions, the presumption is that any electricity generation method that
has low dependence on coal is proÔ¨Åtable and beneÔ¨Åcial. Second, fossil fuels are Ô¨Ånite and their
deposits are being depleted. Developing countries become energy-independent through RESs
because their energy security improves. Moreover, RESs may be highly relevant when countries
with gas or oil resources are involved in armed conÔ¨Çicts because such situations may lead to
energy crises.

Environmentallyfriendlyenergygenerationcanbeimplementedthroughvariousmeans,such

Accordingly, various technologies to reduce the costs associated with the periodic technical

As with any other technical devices, the technical condition and exploitation characteristics of
wind turbines deteriorate in time.
Aminordefectoccurringatacriticalpointoftheblade( ùëñ¬ïùëí¬ï,atthehuborinthevicinityofthe

processes on blades may appear 2‚Äì3 years after commissioning the turbine for operation [3].
Many studies have proven that erosion degrades turbine performance [4, 5]. Sareen et al.[5]
revealed that LE erosion is signiÔ¨Åcantly detrimental to aerofoil performance. They proved that
the increase in drag, resulting from light erosion to heavy erosion, reaches 6%‚Äì500%. Based on
the foregoing, the researchers estimated that an 80% increase in drag due to a relatively small
degree of erosion may result in an annual energy production loss of approximately 5%. If the
dragincreasesto400%‚Äì500%,coupledwiththelossinlift(moderate-to-heavyerosioncases),an
approximately 25% loss in annual energy production may be observed. This state indicates that
an eÔ¨Äective and well-organised technical diagnosis of minor defects can prevent critical damage
to windturbine blades.
Owing to the nature of objects that may constrain measurements, technologies that enable
the remote collection of metrics are optimal for diagnosis. Moreover, currently, measurement
techniques that do not interfere with the structure and surface properties of objects are highly
preferred(non-destructivetestingornon-destructiveexamination).Evidently,theintactnessofan
object under examination is among the most signiÔ¨Åcant factors aÔ¨Äecting the choice of measure-

Ô¨Ånancial losses. Despite the important advantages of this technology, it should be kept in mind
that it is not fully eÔ¨Äective. Taking photographs is possible only under favourable atmospheric
conditions, especially one must be mindful of the wind. The same cost-reduction advantages are
ensured by the TLS technology. However, an additional advantage, compared to photogramme-
try, is the ability to perform measurements under more windy weather conditions. Besides, the
automatization of data processing is nowadays an important issue. Advances in technology have
madecomputer vision (CV) an accurate methodology for assessing the condition of structures.

turbine blades with deep convolutional neural networks.
So far, the studies on the TLS technology, with regard to wind turbines, have been limited to
object deformation veriÔ¨Åcation ( ùëñ¬ïùëí¬ïdeformation and torsion of blade and tower as well as tower
verticality) based on three-dimensional (3D) coordinates. A literature review indicates that the
research on the possibility of using the TLS technology, especially that based on the analysis of
radiometric point cloud information, to detect defects on the surfaces of wind turbine structures
is limited. Accordingly, the present study entailed a thorough investigation and analysis of this
technology.
To the authors‚Äô best knowledge, the TLS technology has the potential for defect detection.
It enables remote measurements with a large information package (more than 1 million points
persecond)andconsiderablyhighresolution.Inadditiontospatialcoordinates,TLSrecordsthe

27]. The application of TLS ranges from the simple modelling of building structures to the
detailed monitoring of the technical conditions of building walls. A recent survey showed that
this technology enables the diagnosis of building structures and detection of wall cracks with
asizeevenofafewmillimetres[28].GiventhetremendouspotentialthatTLShasexhibitedthus
far, it is reasonable to argue that its application to the technical condition examination of wind
turbinebladesmustalsobeinvestigated.Anysurfacechangeontheblade(possiblyadefect)can
be detected based on radiometric point cloud analysis. However, the proposed technology also
has limitations. Many factors aÔ¨Äect the quality of TLS data. The knowledge of the potential and
limitations of a measurement method is signiÔ¨Åcant in planning to attain speciÔ¨Åc objectives. For
instance, measurement involving wind turbine blades is especially challenging.
The main aim of this study was to explore the potential of the TLS technology to examine
the technical conditions of wind turbine blades. The possibility of detecting blade‚Äôs defects was
based on the analysis of radiometric point cloud information, which forms the novelty of the
present study; similar studies are not found in the literature. Condition monitoring focused on
the detection of turbine blade defects, such as cracks, cavities, or signs of erosion. The study

to the centre of the scanner (polar coordinates). They are determined by the horizontal and
vertical angles as well as the distance to the object as measured by a rangeÔ¨Ånder. In addition
to geometric information (XYZ), radiometric information (the so-called intensity parameter) is
derived. Intensity is simply deÔ¨Åned as the ratio of the power of the received energy to the power
of the energy emitted by the TLS device.
The TLS technology is based on measuring the distance between the TLS sensor and tested
target.ManufacturersofTLSscannersusetwotechniquesfordistancemeasurements.Onescanner

technology is characterised by speed, high accuracy, and medium range, whereas the time-of-
Ô¨Çight technology has a longer range, slightly lower accuracy and speed than the former [29].
Therefore, choosing the right type of scanner in the context of expected measurement results is
necessary.
The broad application of this technology indicates its interdisciplinary nature. Therefore, its
implementation to resolve the research problem in this study is anticipated to yield satisfactory
results. The key aspect in the context of using the TLS technology for wind turbine blade defect
detection is the intensity of the laser beam. In this investigation the results were analysed based
ontheintensityparameter.IntensityisanadditionalparameterrecordedbytheTLSdetector[30]
that provides information regarding scanned objects. It is deÔ¨Åned as the backscattered energy of

(PT)and received(PR)TLSsignals[31].ForaLambertiansurface,therelationshipisdescribed
by a simpliÔ¨Åed version of the laser equation [32]. ReÔ¨Çectance is a highly problematic parameter
due to its dependence on multiple physicochemical characteristics of the scanned surface. The
mostsigniÔ¨ÅcanteÔ¨Äectonthepowerofthereceivedsignalcomesfrompropertiessuchascolour,
roughness, and moisture. Many researchers have described the inÔ¨Çuence of these properties on
the absorption and dispersion of laser beams ( ùëí¬ïùëî¬ï, [33‚Äì35]). In contrast, from the perspective
of blade defect detection, the absorption and dispersion of the laser beams can be regarded as
an advantage. This is because blade defects are typically characterised by changes in colour and
structure(smoothness).Basedonthestudiesconductedthusfar( ùëí¬ïùëî.,[34,35]),darkcolourshave
beenfoundtoabsorbagreateramountofthelaserbeamthanlightcolours.Therefore,theintensity
values in blade sections with defects are expected to be lower. Moreover, rough surfaces cause
more beam scattering than smooth surfaces. Consequently, bigger scattering occurs at defect
locations, causing changes inintensity values.
Notably, the change in intensity may also be caused by a change in the angle of incidence of
thelaserbeam.Thisoccursbecauseastheangleofincidenceincreases,thesizeandshapeofthe
laser spot are signiÔ¨Åcantly modiÔ¨Åed [36,37]. Studies have shown that as a rule, intensity values

3. Research and results
To investigate the possibility of using the TLS technology for measuring wind turbine blade
defects,theresearchwasdividedintotwostages.Thesestageswerebothimplementedasaresult
of a partnership with one of the wind farm operators. All tests were performed in an outdoor
environment using a phase-shift scanner (a Z ¬∏F 5016 IMAGER). This scanner is characterised
by a maximum data acquisition rate of 1 100 000 pixel/s, operational range of 0.3‚Äì365 m, and
range error of1mm¬∏10ppm/m. For the Z¬∏F 5016 IMAGER, the laser beam spot size and
divergencewere3.5 mm(attheexit)and0.3mrad,respectively.Theopen-sourceCloudCompare
software was used for the post-processing of datasets and mapping of results. Raw data were
used in this study. Moreover, data normalisation considering the eÔ¨Äect of the laser beam‚Äôs angle
of incidence was ignored because surface changes in a relatively close vicinity were considered.
A general scheme ofthe research programme is shown in Fig. 3.

3.1. Scheme and objects of the research programme
The Ô¨Årst stage of this study entailed laying the groundwork for the next stage of the research
programme. Because no previous work that directly conÔ¨Årmed the utility of the TLS technology
for blade defect detection could be foundin theliterature, atest study wasconducted.

The Ô¨Årst stage consisted of two parts. The Ô¨Årst and second parts were conducted close to
and at a distance from the measured blade, respectively. The close-range measurements were
approximately 5‚Äì7 m, and the far-range measurements were approximately 60‚Äì70 m from the
testedblade.Close-upmeasurementswereperformedbecausethewindfarmoperatordismantled
the blades of one of the turbines (Turbine EW-18, Location I) for maintenance. The dismantled
blades were 20 years old. The blades laying on the ground surface were surveyed for defects.
A photograph of the scanned blades is shown in Fig. 4.

The measurement process described above is crucial to the overall study. It had two primary
purposes.First,thedirectaccesstothedefectsenabledthecomparisonbetweenthevisualassess-
ment of blade defects and the obtained point clouds, providing knowledge on how a particular
type of defect aÔ¨Äected the change in the intensity value of the point cloud. Second, it enabled
the comparison between the point clouds obtained by far-range and close-range measurements,
facilitating the determination as to whether defects were detectable using the TLS technology.
Becauseoftheincreaseddistancetothemeasuredobject,thesizeofthelaserspotwasincreased,
aÔ¨Äecting the eÔ¨Éciency of measurements. These comparisons are crucial because in typical situ-
ations wherein the blades are attached to the turbine, the measurement distances are least 50 m.
The results of this stage ofthe research programmeare reportedin Section 3.2.
Thesecondstageentailedthedevelopmentofanoptimalmethodforevaluatingwindturbine
blade defects. This stage had two parts, each of which corresponds to an examination using
a speciÔ¨Åcmeasurement method.
In the Ô¨Årst part of Stage II, Turbine EW-8 in Location II was measured. Parameters of the
wind turbine: 2 MW turbine, tower height ‚Äì 80 m, blades age ‚Äì 24 years. A schematic of the
measurement method (referred to as Method No. 1) is shown in Fig. 5a. The method proceeds
as follows. The turbine blades remained stationary while the scanner locations were positioned
relative to the turbine. Five measurement positions were identiÔ¨Åed (labelled as 1‚Äì5 in Fig. 5a).
Special artiÔ¨Åcial Z ¬∏F proÔ¨Å targets were used in this measurement session (labelled as t1‚Äìt6 in
Fig.5a).Basedonthesetargets,allobtainedpointcloudswereregisteredtothesamecoordinate
reference system to generate a complete 3D model of the turbine. The results of this part of the
researchprogramme arereported inSection 3.3.
In the second part of Stage II, Turbine EW-1 in Location III was measured. Parameters of
the wind turbine: 2 MW turbine, tower height ‚Äì 100 m, blade age ‚Äì 15 years. The measurement
procedure, referred to as Method No. 2, was opposite to that of Method No. 1. In this second
method,theturbinebladeswereinmotion,andthescannerremainedinoneposition.InMethod

the measurements. Turbine operation refers to the rotation of the blades. In the Ô¨Årst step, the
blade faced downward; positioning the blade parallel to the turbine to the extent possible was
preferred. Then, the blade was positioned so that the suction side (SS) faced the scanner. The
Ô¨Årst measurement was then conducted. Next, the blade was rotated by approximately 90, and
measurements were obtained. Rotations were performed until all four sides of the blade were
measured. Subsequently, the rotor was moved, and the measurements of the second and third
blades were conducted analogously to that of the Ô¨Årst blade. The schematic of Method No. 2. is
presented in Fig. 5b. The results of this part of the research are reportedin Section 3.4.

3.2. Measurement results for Turbine EW-18 in Location I: Stage I
As mentioned in the previous section, in Stage I of the research programme, the capabilities
of the TLS technology in the context of blade defect detection were veriÔ¨Åed. It was determined
whetherbladedefectscanbeeÔ¨ÄectivelydetectedwithTLSandhowthesedefectswerepresented
as point clouds. SpeciÔ¨Åc sections of the three blades were tested. However, only a few snippets
were selected for presentation and analysis becausecertaindefects were similar.
As expected, the TLS technology enables eÔ¨Äective detection of blade defects. The com-
parison of the actual appearance of damages with the point clouds obtained from the close-up
measurements (see Fig. 6a and 6b) lead to the conclusion that the point clouds well reÔ¨Çect the
blade condition; the distribution of the change in intensity values considerably approximates the
damage shapes.
Fig. 6. Testedblade:(a) photographs,(b) close-range measurements and(c) far-rangemeasurements.
The second objective of this research stage was to determine whether the long-distance
detection of blade defects was possible (as planned for the succeeding stages). Due to this
purpose, the same three damaged sections scanned at a close-range were scanned at a distance
of60‚Äì70 m.Thepointcloudsobtainedbyclose-rangeandfar-rangemeasurementsincludingthe
areas selected for analysis are presented in Fig. 6b and 6c, respectively. An initial comparison
reveals some similarities between the selected point clouds. However, an examination of small
sectionsprovidesmoreaccurateresults.Thus,thesectionsselectedforanalysisareshownonthe
right side of Fig. 6.
In addition, four snippets were selected from the second blade. The fragments of the blade
that were apparently the most suitable in the context of analysis were selected for examination.
The selected sections enabled analyses of diÔ¨Äerent situations (see Fig. 7): detection of defects
frombothdistances(redareainFig. 7andFig.8);detectionofrepairsfrombothdistances(black
areas inFig. 7); detectionof defectsonly fromthe closerange(purplearea inFig. 7).

More extensive analyses were performed focusing on the defects that were not detectable
from a certain distance (purple area shown in Fig. 7). This issue was directly related to the size
of the laser spot, which increases with the scanning distance. The aforementioned defect was
extremely minor so it was barely visible in the photograph. The defect was dimensioned using
theCloudComparesoftwarebasedonthepointcloudobtainedbyclose-rangemeasurements.Its
dimensions were approximately 10 mm5mm (Fig. 9). The detection of such minor defects
is diÔ¨Écult because the size of the laser spot at a scanning distance of approximately 70 m is

decreases. Although this can be regarded as a disadvantage, it leads to an important conclusion:
if the damage canbe detectedwith TLS,it isprobably atleast 20 mm insize.
The investigation results indicated the possibility of using the TLS technology to measure
the technical conditions of wind turbine blades. Defects in the external structure of blades, such
as cracks, cavities and erosion can be detected. For this to be possible, turbine operation must
be stopped to immobilise the blades. However, every minute of turbine operation is extremely
expensiveconsideringeconomyandenergygeneration.Therefore,thedevelopmentofanoptimal
measurement method is crucial. Accordingly, the next two sections of this paper present the
analysis resultsof themeasurements obtainedusing twodiÔ¨Äerent methods.

the turbine to remain stationary at all times. Therefore, the Ô¨Årst measurement method assumed
changes in the position of the measurement station (scanner). After analysing the Ô¨Åeld situation
(ùëñ¬ïùëí¬ï, turbine blade arrangement), Ô¨Åve scanner locations were deemed suÔ¨Écient. The inspection
ofeachbladetotheextentpossible( ùëñ¬ïùëí¬ïscanningthefoursurfacesofeachblade)waspreferred.
Moreover,thechoiceofthenumberandlocationofthescannerpositionstoachievemeasurement
eÔ¨Éciencywascrucial.Section 4(DiscussionsandConclusions) furtherelucidatestheforegoing.
The blades were labelled as A, B, and C in accordance with the nomenclature established by
the operator. The obtained point clouds (from Ô¨Åve measurement positions) indicate that Method
No.1 enablesscanning:
‚Äì Position 1 : A fragment of PS of blade A, SS of blade B, and a fragment of PS of blade C.
‚Äì Position 2 : SS and TE of blade A, fragments of TE and PS of blade B, SS and TE of
blade C.
‚Äì Position 3 : TE and fragments of PS and SS of blade A, PS of blade B, and SS of blade C.
‚Äì Position 4 : PS of blade A, LE of blade B, and SS of blade C.
‚Äì Position 5 :TEandPSofbladeA,afragmentofSSofbladeB,afragmentofSSofbladeC.
In the foregoing, PS denotes the pressure side, and TE denotes the trailing edge; SS and LE
are as previously deÔ¨Åned.
Unfortunately, complete measurements were not obtained. The blade arrangement only re-
sulted in the satisfactory scanning of the SS of blade C. The PS, LE, and TE sections were
scanned;however,theresultswereinsuÔ¨Écientforanalysisintermsofdefectdetection.Obtaining

to the scanning of the blade TE. Studies show that the direct measurement of this edge may be

However,incasesofsuccessfulmeasurement,theobtainedpointcloudscanbeusedtoevaluate

smaller parts, some defects are clearly visible (see Fig. 11). Examining and analysing a small
section of the point cloud provide even more eÔ¨Äective results; consequently, the defects that are
not clearly visible from the Ô¨Årst observation can be detected (an exemplary defect presented

Anotherconclusioncanbedrawnbasedontheobtainedpointclouds:thebladeTEisundeni-
ably the most problematic part to inspect (evidently because of its size, speciÔ¨Åcally its relatively
small width). The following section furtherelucidates thetwomethods tested.
4. Discussions and conclusions
Everyminuteisextremelyimportantinwindturbineoperation.Shuttingdowntheturbinefor
an hour results in a considerable energy loss. For example, a 1-MW wind turbine generates ap-
proximately1000 kWin1 hofoperation.However,monitoringthetechnicalconditionsofturbine
blades using the TLS technology without temporarily shutting down the turbine is impossible.
Theanalysesofpointclouds,discussedinSubsections 3.2‚Äì3.4,indicatethatbothmethodsenable
the detection of defects in wind turbine blades. Accordingly, this section presents a comparative
analysis of the two measurement methods with the aim of identifying the better one. Two major
criteria were considered ‚Äì the eÔ¨Äectiveness of the method in relation to the value of the derived
data and the economic aspect of the implemented method. Cost eÔ¨Äectiveness was determined
based onthe rapidityof measurement.
First, the measurement methods are compared in terms of the eÔ¨Äectiveness of the obtained
data.Atthisstage,theresearchersdidnotfocusonthedetailedanalysisofeachdetecteddefectbut
on the feasibility of inspecting the blades. The optimal measurement methods developed by the
researchersallowedthecheckingofallfoursides(twosurfacesandtwoedges)ofthethreeblades,
leading to the following results. Method No. 2 clearly ensures that the results are reproducible
for allblades. Incontrast,in MethodNo.1, thepoint cloudsobtainedmustbe analysed indetail.
Therefore,theÔ¨Årstconclusionthatcanbedrawnisthatthepost-processingofdata(pointclouds)
obtained with Method No. 2 is more researcher-friendly. The analyses results are summarised in
Table2below (‚Äò¬∏‚Äô, ‚Äò ‚Äò, and ‚Äò¬∏¬ù ‚Äò indicate that the surface/edge of the blade has been scanned,
has notbeen scanned,and hasonly beenpartially scanned,respectively).

Anotherconclusionthatcanbedrawnisthatbothmethodscanclearlyprovidetheinformation
about the conditions of the PS and SS of the blades; more thorough analyses are required for
the LE and TE. Unfortunately, in the case of Method No. 1, the position at which the turbine
blades were stopped rendered the measurement of the LE of blades A and C impossible. For
blade B, the LE measurement was possible. In the table above, this measurement was marked
with the symbol ‚Äò*‚Äô, similarly to all the blades measured using Method No. 2. Based on the
obtainedpointclouds,itwasconcludedthatapproximately65%ofthelengthoftheLE(starting
at the nacelle) of a blade can be eÔ¨Äectively scanned using the TLS technology. This is because
the LE width diminishes as the distance from the nacelle increases. A similar problem occurred
in scanning a relatively small TE. In the case of TE, satisfactory measurement was possible by
scanningapproximately25%oftheblade‚Äôslength( ùëñ¬ïùëí¬ï,atthenacelle,wherethewidthisbigger).

Accordingly,theresearchersdecidedtolabelthesemeasurementsobtainedbybothmethodswith
thesymbol‚Äò**‚Äô.Inaddition,thepointcloudsobtainedusingMethodNo.1wereanalysed,leading
to the conclusion that in distant parts of the blade, the TE was extremely narrow so that it could
beconsideredasacombinationofthePSandSSofthebladeratherthanasa‚Äòseparateside‚Äôwith
oneindispensablecondition.Thisisdenotedbythesymbol‚Äò!‚ÄôshownwiththeTEresultsobtained
using Method No. 1. To form thepoint cloudof theTE, a satisfactory scanof thesurfacesof the
two blades is required.
In summary, Table 2indicates that in terms of measurement eÔ¨Äectiveness, Method No. 2 is
more credible. The implementation of this method enables the controlled measurement of the
entire blade surface (three blades). Unfortunately, with Method No. 1, the obtained point clouds
have certaindeÔ¨Åciencies.
The researchers conducted additional studies regarding the accuracy and quality of the ob-
tainedpointclouds.WithMethodNo.2,theresultswererepeatable.Forallsidesoftheblades,the
measurementaccuracyintermsofthedistanceofmeasurementandsizeofthelaserspotwasthe
same. This is deÔ¨Ånitely an advantage during the post-processing and analysis of particular faults
and defects. Unfortunately, with Method No. 1, accuracy and quality vary because of diÔ¨Äerent
scanner positions and distances to the blades. Moreover, within a single scanner position, the
measurementaccuracyofeachbladevaries.Inthismethodology,thelongestdistanceisbetween
the scanner position and the blade facing upwards (blade B). Thus, these scans have the largest
laser spot and the least precise measurement. When the length of the blade is assumed to be
approximately 70 m and the height of the tower is approximately 100 m, the resulting laser spot
becomesextremelylargewhentheendpartofthebladeisscanned.Alargelaserspotrendersthe
detection of small cavities diÔ¨Écult. In addition, with Method No. 1, because of the position of
blade B, the scanner must be more distant from the turbine compared with the required distance
using Method No. 2. This is because of the excessive angle of incidence of the laser beam and
wide scanning area; the problem is illustrated in Fig. 14. To derive a similar angle of incidence
of the laser beam for blade B in Method No. 1 to that employed in Method No. 2 the scanner
must be positioned at a greater distance from the turbine. Thus, considering the distance, range
of measurement, and angle of incidence, Method No. 1 had the worse geometric measurement
conditions thanMethod No. 2.

Another consideration is the economic aspect of the two methods. Measurement time is the
key element in determining the cost eÔ¨Äectiveness of a method. Although shutting down a wind
turbinereducestheamountofelectricitygenerated,monitoringthetechnicalconditionsofblades
is extremely important. From an economic perspective, this is because undetected blade defects
and those that are left unrepaired reduce turbine eÔ¨Éciency; thus, shutting down the turbine is
necessary. However, the length of time during which the turbine is not operational must be as
shortaspossible.Therefore,theresearchersanalysedthetwomethodsconsideringmeasurement
time.ThedurationofthescanningprocesswasmainlyaÔ¨Äectedbythewidthofthescanarea.This
is because of the operation of the scanner (rotation in the horizontal plane). Thus, a wider scan
area results in a greater number of rotations along the horizontal axis, consequently increasing
the total scanning time.
MethodNo.1wasanalysedÔ¨Årst.Themeasurementdurationforeachscannerpositionvaried
and the discrepancies were signiÔ¨Åcant. The foregoing was dependent on the position of the
scanner relative to the turbine because it aÔ¨Äected the size of the scan area. For Method No. 1,
blade scanning lasted as described:
‚Äì Scanner Position no.1: approximately 15 min.
‚Äì Scanner Position no.2: approximately 25 min.
‚Äì Scanner Position no.3: approximately 15 min.
‚Äì Scanner Position no.4: approximately 25 min.
‚Äì Scanner Position no.5: approximately 45 min.
Therefore,thetotaldurationofbladescanningwasapproximately125 min.Inadditiontothe
blade scanning time, the time for the change in the scanner position must be taken into account.
Accordingtotheauthors,a10-minwindowshouldbeallottedforthisstep.Moretimewasneeded
forscanningtheartiÔ¨ÅcialZ ¬∏FproÔ¨Åtargets;foreachscannerpositionitwasapproximately10 min.
Moreover, pre-scans are performed before the Ô¨Ånal scans and 3 min must be added for this task.
Thus, accounting for the times required for blade scanning time (125 min), proÔ¨Å target scanning
(50 min), four changes in scanner position (40 min), and pre-scans (3 min), the total execution
time using Method No. 1 was 218 min.
InthecaseofMethodNo.2,thedurationsofallmeasurements(scans)wereverysimilar.This
wasbecauseofthesamebladeplacementduringscanning.Consequently,thescanningareaswere
considerably similar in size. The average duration of scanning one side of the blade was 3 min;
thus,thefullmeasurementofonebladewasassumedtolast12 min.InMethodNo.2,considering
the time for the change in the scanner position is unnecessary. However, additional time must be
allotted for blade rotations. A single turn lasted less than a minute; thus, approximately 15 min
hadtobeaddedtocompletethesetasks.Inaddition,eachpre-scanlasted2 min.Hence,thetotal
execution time using Method No. 2 was approximately53 min.
In conclusion, the entire research programme has indicated the possibility of using the TLS
technologytosurveythetechnicalconditionsofwindturbineblades.Inthisstudy,theauthorsdid
not focus on identifying speciÔ¨Åc defects (the number and type of defects) but on the potential of
theTLStechnologyforthistask.TheauthorsaimedtoindicatewhetherTLScanbeusedforblade
defect detection and whether TLS might be competitive with the other standing methods. The

tectedbasedontheradiometricinformationofapointcloud.Suchacomprehensivestudy(report)
of the technical condition of the blade is planned in cooperation with the owner of the turbines.
Onthebasisofthecomparativeanalysesconductedandassociateddiscussion,MethodNo.2
was identiÔ¨Åed as more suitable for detecting defects in wind turbine blades than Method No. 1.
Furthermore, the former is the optimal measurement method using the TLS technology. The

obtained results were satisfactory in terms of measurement eÔ¨Éciency and cost eÔ¨Äectiveness.
An additional advantage of this method is the clarity of the point clouds that it provides, thus
enablingresearcher-friendlypost-processing.MethodNo.2isalsocharacterisedbyrepeatability,
which is another advantage. With respect to a single measurement, repeatability means that all
defectsonallbladesaremeasuredwiththesamequality.Moreover,repeatabilityenablesperiodic
measurement, which is the case in turbine blade condition inspection. By properly stabilizing
the measuring position during subsequent inspections, the use of the same scanner positions
is possible. Consequently, reliable monitoring of defect degradation is possible. In summary,
considering the greater eÔ¨Éciency and better quality of the data obtained, shorter measurement
time,andotheradvantages,MethodNo.2isrecommendedformeasuringthetechnicalconditions
of wind turbine blades.
The authors intend to expand the research and conduct laboratory investigations, ùëí¬ïùëî¬ï, to
analyse the eÔ¨Äect of a speciÔ¨Åc defect based on the radiometric information of a point cloud.
Moreover, the operators of wind farms have expressed their desire for further cooperation. The
photogrammetric method is currently the typical one used to examine the condition of wind
turbine blades. However, this study indicated the potential also of the TLS technology for this
task. Thus, in subsequent studies, comparative analyses are planned. The results of applying the
TLS technology will be compared with those obtained using the photogrammetric method. It
is presumed that these two technologies are to a great extent complementary. Such studies will
provideaninsightintoidentifyingtheappropriateapproachtoinspectingthetechnicalconditions
of wind turbine blades.
