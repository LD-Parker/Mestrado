ABSTRACT
Rotor blades are the most complex structural components in a
wind turbine and are subjected to continuous cyclic loads of
wind and self-weight variation. The structural maintenance
operations in wind farms are moving towards condition based
maintenance (CBM) to avoid premature failures. For this,
damage prognosis with remaining useful life (RUL) estima-
tion in wind turbine blades is necessary. Wind speed varia-
tion plays an important role inﬂuencing the loading and con-
sequently the RUL of the structural components. This study
investigates the effect of variable wind speed between the cut-
in and cut-out speeds of a typical wind farm on the RUL of
a damage detected wind turbine blade as opposed to aver-
age wind speed assumption. RUL of wind turbine blades are
estimated for different initial crack sizes using particle ﬁlter-
ing method which forecasts the evolution of fatigue crack ad-
dressing the non-linearity and uncertainty in crack propaga-
tion. The stresses on a numerically simulated life size onshore
wind turbine blade subjected to the above wind speed load-
ing cases are used in computing the crack propagation obser-
vation data for particle ﬁlters. The effects of variable wind
speed on the damage propagation rates and RUL in compar-
ison to those at an average wind speed condition are studied
and discussed.
1. INTRODUCTION
Wind energy has grown to be one of the most popular sources
of renewable energies around the world within a span of
two decades. The size and capacities of individual wind
turbines have rapidly increased over time to meet the clean
energy goals and demands (Wymore, Van Dam, Ceylan, &
Qiao, 2015). In addition to initial installation costs, main-
tenance and operation costs of wind turbines account to ap-
proximately 20-25% of the total levelized cost per kWh (El-
Thalji & Jantunen, 2012). Unlike the popular preventive and

sary labor and pre-mature replacement costs due to sched-
uled maintenance practices (preventive) and expensive post-
failure repair and replacement costs (corrective) by optimiz-
ing the maintenance schedule based on the RUL, repair and
replacement costs (Gupta & Lawsirirat, 2006). RUL is salient
for CBM of components that undergo prolonged deterioration
under ﬂuctuating loads before failure, which include blades,
tower and other mechanical components in a wind turbine.
1.1. Fatigue Damage in Wind Turbine Blades and Effect
of Wind Speed Fluctuations
Among the structural components of the wind turbines, rotor
blades are subjected to the most dynamically varying loads.
Blade damage accounts for around 23% of the total failure
events accompanied by signiﬁcant downtime and replace-
ment costs (Ciang, Lee, & Bang, 2008; Florian & Sørensen,
2015). The wind turbine rotor blades consist of load carry-
ing shear webs or hollow beam laminates for ﬂapwise and
edgewise moments along the blade and light weight core to
resist torsion and buckling. The laminate frame is made of
ﬁber reinforced polymer composite materials and the core
is made of foam or balsa wood and the two are typically
bonded by adhesives. The core is covered with compos-
ite laminates or gel coats for protection (Mcgugan, Pereira,
Sørensen, Toftegaard, & Branner, 2015; Al-Khudairi et al.,
2017). Although the modern wind turbine blades are de-
signed to withstand the loads for at least 20 years, there is
always a chance for external causes of damage such as from
lightening or an inherent ﬂaw in the complex blade structure
during blade manufacture (Nielsen & Sørensen, 2017). Mul-
tiple studies have identiﬁed few hotspots (Ciang et al., 2008)
in the wind turbine blade structure with high probabilities for
damage. Fatigue crack at the blade root, maximum chord lo-
cation, 30% and 70% of blade length from root are some of
the frequently encountered fatigue crack locations that are re-
ported from experiments and simulation studies (Kong, Kim,
Han, & Sugiyama, 2006; Schulz & Sundaresan, 2002). Up-
per spar cap and its ﬂange are also identiﬁed as the critical
1

locations depending on the pitch angle of the blade (Shokrieh
& Raﬁee, 2006). Delamination, debonding and intralaminar
failure are some of the damage modes that need attention in
these locations (Lading, McGugan, Sendrup, Rheinl ¨ander, &
Rusborg, 2002).
Faults in blades if unchecked can grow in size eventu-
ally causing a catastrophic damage to the integrity of sys-
tem (Ciang et al., 2008). Condition monitoring and diagnosis
is the fundamental step in the RUL estimation of wind tur-
bine blades. With many advances in structural damage detec-
tion and diagnosis (Yao & Pakzad, 2012; Shahidi et al., 2015;
Yao, Pakzad, & Venkitasubramaniam, 2017; Gulgec, Tak ´aˇc,
& Pakzad, 2017), SHM system should be capable enough to
detect and localize the faults at a minimum required stage of
evolution such that sufﬁcient time is available to achieve eco-
nomic CBM. Numerous SHM strategies (Kirikera, Schulz, &
Sundaresan, 2007; Rumsey & Paquette, 2008; Furong Zhang,
Yongqian Li, Zhi Yang, & Liping Zhang, 2009; Kim et al.,
2014; LeBlanc, Niezrecki, Avitabile, Chen, & Sherwood,
2013; Yang, Peng, Wei, & Tian, 2017) for wind turbine blades
have been proposed, studied and tested (Dutton et al., 2003;
Kirikera et al., 2008; Ou, Dertimanis, & Chatzi, 2016; Ou,
Chatzi, Dertimanis, & Spiridonakos, 2016).
Being subjected to highly irregular loads caused by a com-
bination of turbulent wind ﬂow, varying direction of gravi-
tational load, centrifugal loads, triggers the fatigue damage
progression in the above mentioned hotspots (Al-Khudairi et
al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017). Major cyclic loads are induced
by gravity result in edgewise bending and wind loads induce
ﬂap-wise and edgewise bending in the blades. In addition to
the dynamic component of wind loading wind speed ﬂuctu-
ations can expedite the damage regression. The wind speed
experienced by the wind turbines typically varies between a
cut-in speed Vinof 2 m/sec to a cut-out speed Voutof 25
m/sec (Hayat, Asif, Ali, Ijaz, & Mustafa, 2015) beyond which
wind turbine operation is halted. Weibull distribution of wind
speeds is typically observed as shown in Fig. 1. Wind speeds
can vary day to day and it is anticipated in this paper that this
can affect the estimation of RUL in comparison with that of
the estimated using a mean wind speed.
In this paper a particle ﬁltering based prognostic procedure is
applied for RUL estimation of wind turbine blades subjected
to fatigue damage for variable wind speed loading using par-
ticle ﬁlters. The results are compared to the RULs estimated
with a constant average wind speed of 12 m/sec which is pre-
sented in a previous study by the authors (Valeti & Pakzad,
2018). The following sections discuss the RUL estimation
using particle ﬁlters followed by its application in RUL es-
timation for wind turbine blades under fatigue loading. Fol-
lowing this results of the two wind speed loading conditions
mentioned before are discussed and compared.

2. RUL E STIMATION
2.1. Prognosis for RUL Estimation
RUL of a structural component can be deﬁned as the time be-
tween the last known condition to the time when it reaches
a predeﬁned threshold condition before maintenance is re-
quired (Si, Wang, Hu, & Zhou, 2011). Prognosis is to predict
future behavior which is required for estimation of the RUL
of a deteriorating subsystem or a component (Vachtsevanos,
Lewis, Roemer, Hess, & Wu, 2006). Fatigue, being one of
the important failure modes in wind turbine blades, the abil-
ity to assess RUL considering various uncertainties and cur-
rent damage state is necessary to make conﬁdent and safe
maintenance decisions. (Newman, 1981) developed analyt-
ical model of cyclic crack growth that includes the effects of
crack closure to correlate crack growth under aircraft spec-
trum loading on aluminum alloy plate material. Several stud-
ies have been conducted for determining the RUL in wind
turbine blades through classical fatigue crack propagation
laws (Shokrieh & Raﬁee, 2006; Beganovic, Njiri, Rothe, &
Soffker, 2015; Hayat et al., 2015). (Corbetta, Sbarufatti,
Giglio, Saxena, & Goebel, 2018) proposed a particle ﬁl-
ter based Bayesian damage prognosis framework extended
to multiple damage mechanisms for fatigue life prediction
of composite laminates under co-existing matrix cracks and
delamination. Sanchez et al. (2016) (Sanchez, Sankarara-
man, Escobet, Frost, & Goebel, 2016) estimated the RUL
for a medium sized wind turbine blade using fatigue stiff-
ness degradation damage model developed for Carbon ﬁber
reinforced polymers (CFRP) materials. The damage model
was applied on blade root moment sensor information from
a wind turbine simulated in a high ﬁdelity simulator FAST
v8 (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures and Turbulence) and
subjected to different wind speed scenarios.

methods speciﬁcally for RUL estimation into four categories
namely, Knowledge-based models, Life expectancy models
(stochastic and statistical), Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANN)
and Physical models. The physical models are the most accu-
rate of the above methods but are expensive with low range of
system applicability compared to the knowledge base meth-
ods which are on the other end of the spectrum. The ANN’s
performance on the other hand have been known to be limited
to short term prognosis. It is the uncertainties in measured
fault, deﬁnition of damage characteristics, fault propagation
model, material characterization and future loads act as im-
pediments to accurate RUL estimation. Due to these uncer-
tainties, the estimation of conﬁdence limits along with RUL
is important. A plethora of literature is available on crack
growth modeling and RUL estimation in engineering mate-
rials for stochastic deterioration models and statistical data
driven approaches through stochastic life expectancy mod-
els (Si et al., 2011; Medjaher, Tobon-Mejia, & Zerhouni,
2012; Le Son, Fouladirad, Barros, Levrat, & Iung, 2013)
without the drawbacks from other methods. The stochastic
life expectancy models consider RUL as a statistically iden-
tical random variable and deﬁne it with a probability den-
sity function. This random variable carries the measurement,
modeling and loading uncertainties. Dynamic Bayesian net-
work models such as Markov models, Kalman ﬁlters and par-
ticle ﬁlters are some of the stochastic life expectancy models
that are popularly used in engineering prognostics (Bartram
& Mahadevan, 2013).
2.2. RUL Estimation with Particle Filters
Particle ﬁlters are essentially the Monte Carlo based nonlin-
ear Bayesian tracking methods that address the nonlinearity
in the state evolution and/or non-Gaussian noise in the pro-
cess and measurements. Particle ﬁlters are particularly useful
when the posterior distribution is non-standard or multivari-
ate (Arulampalam, Maskell, Gordon, & Clapp, 2002; Cadini,
Zio, & Avram, 2009; Zio & Peloni, 2011). Which makes the
method very much suitable for forecasting a nonlinear pro-
cess such as crack growth (Haile, Riddick, & Assefa, 2016).
Given a damage propagation process is measured until the
current time say k, the RUL estimation is performed as de-
scribed in the following three steps (Fig. 2) (M. Orchard, Wu,
& Vachtsevanos, 2005; An, Choi, & Kim, 2013). Step 1:
Damage state estimation using particle ﬁlters upto time k,
Step 2: p-step ahead prediction ( xk+1toxk+p) until reach-
ing a threshold and Step 3: RUL estimation.
2.2.1. Step 1: State Estimation
Nonlinear Bayesian tracking: Deﬁne the damage state or
crack length xkat timekwith a non-linear state transition
equationfkas a function of previous damage state at k 1
(ﬁrst order Markov process assumption). Deﬁne the mea-sured damage state with observation model hkas a function
of the state through the following state space equations Eq.
(1) and Eq. (2) (M. Orchard et al., 2005; Cadini et al., 2009;
Zio & Peloni, 2011).
xk=fx(xk 1;!k) !p(xkjxk 1) (1)
zk=hx(xk;k) !p(zkjxk) (2)
!kandkare non-Gaussian noise vectors of known distri-
butions corresponding to uncertainty in the damage process
model and measurements respectively.
Prediction Step: In the prediction step the a priori state is es-
timated using previous state distribution p(xk 1jz1:k 1)with
Chapman-Kolmogorov equation
p(xkjz1:k 1) =Z
p(xkjx1:k 1)p(xk 1jz1:k 1)dxk 1(3)
Update Step: The a priori state estimation p(xkjz1:k 1)
Eq. (3) is now updated to p(xkjz1:k)with observation zkas
shown in Eq. (5) using Bayes rule.
p(xkjz1:k) =p(zkjxk)p(xkjz1:k 1)
p(zkjz1:k 1)(4)
where the normalizing constant
p(zkjz1:k 1) =Z
p(zkjxk)p(xkjz1:k 1)dxk (5)
The prediction and update steps are performed recursively for
state estimation.
Particle Filters In case of nonlinear processes with non-
standard posterior distributions, particle ﬁlters that are ap-
proximate nonlinear Bayesian ﬁlters that offer sub optimal
solution to the Bayesian tracking problem. The key is to use
a set of random samples with associated weights to represent
the posterior density function. These particles and weights
are updated measurement likelihood called sequential impor-
tance sampling. Bayesian tracking with a general scheme
for particle ﬁlters is explained as follows (Jouin, Gouriveau,
Hissel, P ´era, & Zerhouni, 2016).
Nsparticles are created based on a known initial state xo
(equivalent to initial crack length). In each iteration the
particles for the current state xi
kjk 1are obtained using
Eq. (3), and weights of the particles are updated by Eq. (6)
(Arulampalam et al., 2002)
wk=wk 1p(zkjxk)p(xkjxk 1)
q(xkjx0:k 1;z1:k)(6)
where,q(x0:kjz1:k)is importance density function and
p(zkjxk)being the likelihood of current state measure-
ment. The posterior state pdf p(xkjz1:k)is approximated
by particles with corresponding discrete probability masses
(Eq. (7)) with particles and normalized importance weights

tive resampling can be employed that is to allow resampling
only when ^Neff<Ns.
2.2.2. Step 2: Prognosis
Using the current state estimate and updated fault growth
model parameters, long term state predictions are generated
by a recursive integration process based on importance sam-
pling Eq. (8) (M. E. Orchard & Vachtsevanos, 2009).

nosis is propagated similar manner to the tracking stage.
2.2.3. Step 3: RUL Estimation
The residual life of a structure after fatigue crack initiation
depends on speed of crack propagation and the of size of crit-
ical defect that can be tolerated by the structure under ex-
treme loading (Benedetti, Fontanari, & Battisti, 2013). RUL
is estimated as the weighted average of the duration of time
between the end of last observation and when each of the par-
ticles reaches the threshold.

3. RUL E STIMATION FOR WIND TURBINE BLADES
WITH FATIGUE DAMAGE
The effect of variable wind speed in comparison with a con-
stant average wind speed on RUL estimations is studied using
a simulated wind turbine blade response. The fatigue dam-
age observations from time to time are generated using the
blade response and used in the particle ﬁlters based prognosis
method discussed above to estimate the RULs. The details
of the generation of crack propagation observations, RUL es-
timation and comparison of the results are elucidated in the
following sections.

3.1. Generating Fatigue Crack Propagation Observa-
tions
RUL is estimated for a 5MW onshore wind turbine blade
with fatigue damage deﬁned by National Renewable Energy
Laboratory (NREL) (Jonkman, Butterﬁeld, Musial, & Scott,
2009; Tezduyar, Sathe, Schwaab, & Conklin, 2008) sim-
ulated in FAST v8 (Jonkma & Jonkman, 2016) a high ﬁ-
delity aero-elastic computer aided engineering tool that simu-
lates coupled dynamic responses of horizontal axis wind tur-
bines (Valeti & Pakzad, 2018). Fatigue crack propagation
observations are generated from the stress histories of sim-
ulated wind turbine blades under varying and constant wind
speed loading (Fig. 3) for initial crack lengths, ao= 0:01;
0:03;0:05;0:07;0:09at 30% length of the blade (61.5 m)
from root. The stress histories are calculated with dynamic
response of the simulated blade subjected to turbulence for
a period of 10 min of a given wind speed. In constant wind
speed case 12 m/s is used to generate the crack observations
representing the average wind speed between VinandVout
wind speeds typically experienced by onshore wind farms. In
case of variable wind speed wind loading histories were gen-
erated for wind speeds between VinandVout. In this study
VinandVoutare chosen as 2m=s and22m=s respectively.
Wind speed loading is changed randomly within this range
every 24 hrs to ﬁt a Weibull distribution as shown in Fig.
(1). The loads due start and stoppage of wind turbine, sud-
den gusts are ignored for simplicity and time conservation
during simulations. The force response history of the simu-
lated wind turbine blades at multiple locations is stored. This
is used to generate axial stress histories using the blade air-
foil geometrical properties at desired locations (Jonkman et
al., 2009).
Walker’s equation for variable loading fatigue crack propaga-
tion (Stephens, Fatemi, Stephens, & Fuchs, 2001) is used to
generate crack propagation observations with the blade stress
histories (Florian & Sørensen, 2015). A very strong simpli-
fying assumption is made in this study by modeling delam-
ination and micro-crack density propagation with Walker’s
equation. Homogeneity of the blade materials is assumed.
The change in the stress intensity factor Kwith crack
growth is calculated from current crack length aand root
mean square stress range computed with the Rainﬂow count-
ing algorithm (Eq. 11) (Downing & Socie, 1982; Florian &
Sørensen, 2015).

with change in the wind speed every 24 hours, in the variable

3.2. Prognosis with Particle Filters
3.2.1. RUL Estimation
Particle ﬁlters use the generated observations, transition
(Eq. 13) and measurement (Eq. 14) models to generate poste-
rior distributions at the end of chosen number of observations
(50 or 100) for different loading conditions discussed above.

results in damage estimate closer to actual value.
3.2.2. RUL Estimate Comparison
To understand the effect of variable wind speed on the dam-
age progression, the RUL estimates from Table 2 are com-
pared for 12m/sec and variable wind speed cases for 50 ob-
servations (Fig. 9) and 100 observations (Fig. 10). The con-
stant average wind speed underestimates the RULs compared
to the variable wind speed cases. The lower RUL estimates in
case of constant average wind speed loading case is attributed
to the faster damage progression in the observations for this
case compared to variable wind speed loading. The difference
between the RUL estimates seems to decrease with aocloser
to the critical crack length or threshold for 50 observations
case. This can be justiﬁed by the fact that damage progression

rate is high closer to the threshold and the compared loading
conditions do not result in much difference. The difference
of RULs for both the wind speed loading cases is within a
range of 70 to 40 hrs which is 2 to 3 days in the maintenance
schedule of wind farm.
4. C ONCLUSIONS
Particle ﬁlters were used to estimate the RUL of wind turbine
blades with different lengths of initial cracks at 30% length
from blade root for constant wind speed and variable wind
speed loading conditions and compared. The following con-
clusions were drawn as a result of this study:
1. The variable wind speed results in a less conservative es-
timate of RUL of wind turbine blade in comparison with
constant average wind speed of 12 m/s, in0line with the
observations generated for each of the cases. The differ-
ence of RULs for both the wind speed loading cases is
within a range of 70 to 40 hrs which is 2 to 3 days in
the maintenance schedule of wind farm. This should be
studied for different average wind speeds depending on
the wind speed distribution of a particular farm to gener-
alize the results.
2. The difference between the RUL estimates decreases
withaocloser to the critical crack length or threshold

This can be justiﬁed by the fact that damage progression
rate is high closer to the threshold where the loading con-
ditions chosen for the study did not result in very differ-
ent RULs.
3. Higher number of observations result in better prognosis
and RUL estimation.
4. Particle ﬁlters address the nonlinearity in the damage
propagation model and the uncertainty in the model pa-
rameter deﬁnition which makes then very much suitable
for prognosis of fatigue damage in wind turbine blades.
