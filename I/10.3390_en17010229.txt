Abstract: To develop reliable numerical models and better interpret monitoring campaigns exper-
imental data of wind turbines, knowing the structure operation conditions, in particular the rotor
angular velocity and blades’ pitch angle, is of paramount importance, but often not known due to
conﬁdentiality restrictions, or known with low time resolution (typically 10 min average values). In
this work, it is shown analytically that blades accelerations measurements contain valuable informa-
tion that allow for a better characterisation of the effective rotor shaft tilt and blades cone angle for
different operating conditions. It is also shown that these measurements can be used to reconstruct
the time history of the rotor angular velocity and blades’ pitch angle. After presented in an analytical
framework, the methodology is validated with experimental data of two full scale wind turbines. The
successful reconstruction of the rotor operating conditions shows that the method presented can be
used to provide further insight into the dynamics of the structure that aids monitoring data analysis
and provides an alternative method to monitor the SCADA systems themselves. The paper com-
bines quite unique experimental data collected at two operating rotors with original data processing
strategies that provide very valuable information to researchers and wind turbine operators.
Keywords: blades measurements; rotor characterisation; SCADA data; MEMS acceleration sensors
1. Introduction
A proper knowledge of the rotor geometrical properties, namely the angle between
the rotor rotation axis and the horizontal (tilt) and the blades’ angle with respect to a plane
orthogonal to rotor rotation axis (cone angle), is important for many applications in wind
turbine numerical modelling and structural health monitoring, as they impact the perceived
loads in both the blades and the tower, but not always known with adequate uncertainty
levels. In fact, recently proposed strain gauges calibration improved procedures try to
explicitly include the impact on the rotor tilt and blade cone angles, as well as the blades
pitch angle, in the internal forces originated at the tower basis, when a nacelle untwist event
occurs [ 1]. More recently, a new method for computing the forces and bending moments
on operating wind turbine blades using strain measurements at the blades’ root has also
been presented [ 2]. In this case, the blades’ cone angle is neglected and the rotor tilt is
assumed to be constant for any operating condition, which may not be realistic due to
the tower deﬂection induced by the external applied loads. This will mimic an effective
rotor tilt that may differ from its design value. Additionally, in the quest for increasingly
more efﬁcient wind turbines, recent studies have revealed that the rotor tilt angle has a non
negligible effect not only in the internal loads experienced by both the blades and tower [ 3]
but also in the aerodynamic performance [ 4,5] and even in the power production [ 6] of
these structures. Finally, it should be noted that these angles are also of great importance to
allow for the construction of reliable numerical models of wind turbines. In this case, not
only their design value is relevant, but also, if truly digital twins are to be constructed, a
methodology that can be used to compare it against experimental data is needed.

From a different perspective, condition and structural monitoring of wind turbines
is essential to maximise the economic beneﬁt of a given wind farm, as this information is
used to optimise its behaviour as well as to predict necessary maintenance actions (see, for
instance [ 7–9]). For these purposes, every installed and operating modern wind turbine is
provided with its own Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system, more commonly
referred to as SCADA. This system registers key variables from both environmental (wind
speed, turbulence intensity, wind direction, among others) and operational (rotor angular
velocity, generator temperature, power production, blades’ pitch, among others) conditions
that are not only a key feature for the operation strategies, as have also been used for the
development of artiﬁcial intelligence and deep learning techniques for wind turbine condi-
tion monitoring (see, for instance, the work by Tautz-Weinert and Watson [10] concerning
the mechanical and electrical parts of the rotor, Papatheou et al. [11] for identiﬁcation of
unhealthy wind turbines in a wind farm or refs. [ 12–14] as examples of non-intrusive
methodologies that have also been developed over the years to identify different types
of faults). Due to its importance, an independent methodology to estimate some of its
variables is of signiﬁcant importance. Furthermore, the SCADA available are often recorded
with a low time resolution, typically 10 min, which is clearly insufﬁciency to fully charac-
terise important transient events.
In this work, it is shown that the accelerations measurements obtained at the blades
can be used for both purposes discussed above. Here, it should be noted that while
the methodologies already mentioned use SCADA information or operation conditions
parameters as inputs, in this work is proposed a new methodology to reconstruct the
SCADA data itself. If traditional measurement systems are often associated with complex
cable connections and signiﬁcant dependence from an external power supply, making
their application to wind turbines’ blades monitoring not feasible, recently available,
microelectromechanical system (MEMS) based wireless nodes as the ones developed at
the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP) do not experience these
limitations, making them highly suitable for this type of installations [ 15]. These sensors
have already been applied successfully to monitor human-induced vibrations at a steel
bridge [ 16], as well as to the continuous dynamic monitoring of Infante D. Henrique bridge,
Portugal [ 17]. Here, it is proposed to extend the application of these sensors to bridge the
gap between wind turbines’ numerical model and experimental data by using the blades’
accelerations time series to infer the rotor geometrical parameters and to study how they
evolve with the operating conditions, as well as to reconstruct some key features of the
SCADA systems, namely the rotor angular velocity and the blades pitch angle.
2. Analytical Considerations
2.1. Reference Frames and Rotation Matrix
The position of the sensors in the blades with respect to a ﬁxed reference frame can be
deﬁned from 4 different angles:
• The inclination of the nacelle q
• The angular position of the blade a
• The precone angle b
• The pitch plus structural twist over the blade axis g
In the following calculations, the angles will be used in this order to transform vector
quantities from one reference frame (RF) to another. The relevant reference frames, as
represented in Figure 1, are a tower bounded RF (deﬁne by the unitary vectors ˆai), a nacelle
bounded RF ( ˆbi), a RF rotated over the rotor rotation axis by the azimuth angle of a reference
blade ( ˆci), a RF obtained by rotating the previously deﬁned RF by the blade cone angle ( ˆdi)
and a blade-axis bounded RF that pitches with the blade ( ˆei).

noted that, as represented, q<0. The sensor itself is assumed to oriented along the unitary vectors
of the pitched reference frame, ˆei.
Since the accelerations and strain gauges should be expressed in the blades’ moving
reference frame, in an approach similar to the one used by Tcherniak and Schwaab [18], the
rotation matrices that relate a given reference frame to the next are needed, namely:

where the convention sdsindandcdcosdhave been introduced.
2.2. Accelerations Measurements
The gravitational force is more easily expressed in the ˆaireference frame such that, in
the absence of any rotation, the measured acceleration of a given acceloremeter is simply:
ag=g=gˆa3=g
0 0 1T
a(2)
where the index in the explicit vector representation has been included to clearly identify
the reference frame and gis the gravitational acceleration. It is important to note that the
accelerometer measurements (of sensors that are sensitive to gravity acceleration, as is being
assumed to be the case) are recorded with respect to a free falling reference frame, such
that a standing still accelerometer at the Earth’s surface pointing upwards will measure
g9.81 m/s2, while a free falling one will register 0 m/s2.
On the other hand, the centripetal and tangential accelerations due to the rotor rotation
are more easily expressed in the reference frame that moves with the blade, ˆci:
ac= W2Rcosbˆc3= W2Rcosb
0 0 1T
c(3)
at= dW

whereWandRare the rotor angular velocity and the distance between the instrumented
section and axis of rotation, respectively. The value measured by an accelerometer can then
be obtained considering and transforming the different contributions as:

R2R1agja+acjc+atjc

The sensitivity of these measurements to variations of the different parameters is repre-
sented in Figures 2–4, where two out of the nacelle tilt, blade cone and blade pitch angles
have been ﬁxed and the remaining one varied within a certain range. It can be seen that the
accelerations time series, when any combination of 2 channels is considered, describe an
ellipsis that may be written, in its most general form, as:

where xcandycare the centre point coordinates, mis the rotation angle as measured from
the positive xsemi-axis and aandbare the ellipsis semi-axis associated to the axis obtained
after the rotation by the angle  m. As will be seen, these parameters, that can be measured
in the ﬁeld, can be related with the rotor geometrical properties.

3. Blades Measurements Relation with Operation and Structural Parameters
3.1. Model Calibration from Measurements
The ﬁrst contribution based on the blades accelerations measurements that will be
presented is the possibility of determining the rotor geometrical angles (nacelle tilt, blades
precone and pitch) from experimental measurements alone. This is particular relevant
for the development of numerical models of structures that are being instrumented when
conﬁdentiality issues limit the amount of data available. For this particular analysis, only
setups with particular conditions (that may be identiﬁed from the measurements alone)
will be used, a restriction that will then be relaxed.
By requiring the rotor to rotate with a constant angular velocity, a corresponding
constant term is originated by the centripetal acceleration, given by:
ac= W2Rh
 cgsbcbsgsbcbc2
biT(7)
where from now on the index in the vector explicit representation is omitted since it is
implicitly assumed a representation in the local sensors reference frame. On the other
hand, an additional constant term and a time varying component have their origin in the
gravitational pull since:

Matching the different terms with the ones in Equation (6), the different parameters can be

At this point a special remark should be made regarding the accelerometers uncertainties.
The response of such an equipment can be parameterised as:
am=Sar+O (18)
where Sis the sensitivity and Othe offset that map the real acceleration arto the measured
value am. While it may be assumed that S1for well calibrated devices, it might not
be thatO 0(as discussed by [ 19], it is common the existence of small variations of the
sensor offset over time). From the equations above, it can be seen that the offset condition
impacts the coordinates of the ellipsis centre, while the sensitivity impacts both the centre
and the ellipsis parameters. Since only the errors on the sensitivity are being neglected,
it can be seen that although the centre point coordinates could theoretically be used to
estimate the needed parameters, these are not reliable, so only differential measurements
should be used. Having set this clear, it can be noted that Equation (17) can readily be used
to provide a direct estimate for gsince:

The pitch angle (plus the structural twist) is then simply the inclination of the ellipse when
evaluated in the xyplane. Using this conclusion, Equations (15) and (16) above can be
rewritten as:

The expressions above show that the precone angle can be obtained by the ratio between

ratio between one of the semi-axis and the gravitational acceleration.

3.2. Operating Conditions Estimates
Once the geometrical angles are constrained (or known a priori ), every time series may
be used to recover the angular velocity and pitch angle. This information is once more
hardly available (the more easily available SCADA data is limited to a time resolution of
10 min), but can be used to gain additional insight into the operation conditions of the wind
turbine that can signiﬁcantly enhance the interpretation of the monitoring data.
Firstly, let the data be cleaned such that only the component directly related to the
rotor rotation is kept, which may be easily done by applying a calibrated low pass ﬁlter to
the data. After this step, it can be noted that the following relations hold:

4. Results
4.1. Experimental Campaign Overview
The sensors used in this monitor campaign have been developed at FEUP and the
description here presented mainly follows the extensive description provided in [ 17]. The
data are saved locally in a microSD card. The ﬁles have a duration of 10 min each and are
organised in a folder structure identiﬁed according to the date of the measurements.
The MEMS accelerometer is of digital type integrating a 20-bit ADC and includes
internal antialiasing ﬁlters, programmable frequency rate and dynamic range. In this
case, the frequency rate was ﬁxed at 62.5 Hz, being the low-pass cut-off frequency set to
15.625 Hz (the sensor automatically sets the frequency of this ﬁlter to one-quarter of the
sampling frequency to avoid aliasing errors). With this conﬁguration, we ensure, with
an adequate safety margin, an accurate characterisation of the signal frequency content
between 0 Hz (DC) and 6 Hz.
This version of the wireless nodes is not equipped with any hardware for time syn-
chronisation, each node containing a high-precision clock that works independently. In this
solution, the autonomy is increased, the cost is reduced, and the ﬂexibility of the system
layout increased (no limitations on the sensors distance and no need to be installed in open
sky, as it happens in systems synchronised by GPS).
The system is powered by nine batteries of 3400 mAh capacity each, enabling an
autonomy of 6 months in continuous operation. The module contains an XBee radio
transmission module, but in the present application, in order to extend the batteries’ life,
the online data transmission is disabled. In order to optimise the size of sensor, the enclosure
was customised, using for this purpose a 3D printer. One of the main advantages of this
system is the possibility of developing monitoring solutions specially designed for a given
experimental campaign.

The data that will be used in this work was obtained from the extensive monitoring
campaign being conducted in the context of the WindFarmSHM project in a windfarm
located in Tocha, Portugal. This windfarm included 5 VESTAS V100 wind turbines, labelled
from WT1 to WT5, with a rated power of 1.8 MW. The experimental campaign, described
in detail in [ 20] for which 10-min averaged SCADA data was also available, includes
accelerometers and strain gauges installed in both the tower and the blades of WT1 and
WT5 (WT1 with the 3 blades instrumented and WT5 with two blades instrumented), namely
a set of ﬁbre optic strain gauges at each blade’s root and the MEMS accelerometers described
above placed at roughly 10m from the root, as represented in Figure 5. The methodology
that will be presented in the following section will rely only on the latter.

installed in wind turbine WT1 and WT5 of Tocha wind farm (adapted from Pacheco [21]).
4.2. Parameters Estimation
Firstly, time periods where the rotor was parked have been selected by identifying
regions where the accelerations measurements were constant with a time length of at least
1 min. Additionally, it should be noted that, as long as the pitch angle is the same, all
the selected time periods should be possible to ﬁt within a single ellipse. The results are
presented in Figure 6, while from the ﬁtted parameters, the geometrical angles can be
immediately estimated:
s2
b=0.763
9.4432
 !b=4.7(40)
c2
q=9.479
9.8062
 !q= 14.8(41)
m= g=35.2(42)
The pitch angle obtained above is not particularly relevant since it only represents the
sensors particular position on the blade and should not be read as the SCADA equivalent
pitch value.
To study how these parameters evolve with the operating conditions, the parked rotor
scenario has been dropped, while still demanding for constant angular velocities. The
evolution of each angle with the rotor angular velocity are plotted in Figure 7, where have
been included results for all the blades of both wind turbines and where have been plotted
not the pitch angle value, but its variation, since the reference value has no particularly
signiﬁcant meaning as it is related to the sensors location on the blade. Although the
expected pitch curve is successfully reproduced, the tilt and precone dependencies still
need further explanations. In fact, it can be seen that for regions of constant pitch angle,
the tilt increases with the rotor speed, and hence with the wind speed, while the precone

decreases. Both these results are expected. However, some coupling between the pitch
angle and both predictions can also be identiﬁed, in particular in the discontinuity between
the estimations for very low wind speeds and operating conditions. This may be explained
since the measurements are not being made on the blades centre, but on its surface. Never-
theless, the parameters needed for a numerical model can still be identiﬁed as the almost
constant values obtained for parked conditions, since the wind induced behaviour should
be properly reproduced when the structural response under different loading conditions
is considered. Furthermore, small variations of about 1of the averaged pre-cone angle
observed for different blades might be explained by the sensor installation (the sensor
longitudinal axis might not be perfectly parallel with the blade longitudinal axis) and this
will most certainly not have an important impact on the modelling results.

4.3. SCADA Data Reconstruction
Considering now a single setup where varying operating conditions could be easily
identified. For this particular setup, the 10 min resolution SCADA data registered a rotor
angular velocity between 2.3 and 10.1, with a mean value of 4.3 RPM, and a pitch angle
between 3.6and 20.1, with a mean value of 13.6. After applying Equations (38) and (39) ,
the full pitch and rotor angular velocity time series have been reconstructed as represented
in Figure 8, where it should be recalled that the absolute value of the pitch value is not
signiﬁcant, only its variation. The distinct operation conditions are easily identiﬁable in
the accelerations time series, and are also present in the reconstructed SCADA time series.
The maximum and minimum values of the RPM are validated, the total pitch variation is
validated and the mean RPM value is also conﬁrmed.

Finally, a full month of data has been analysed and the estimates for the mean value of
the rotor angular velocity and pitch value compared with the SCADA ones. The results
are plotted in Figure 9. It should be noted that the purpose of the representation used in
Figure 9 is not only to allow for a visual inspection of the results based on the typical pitch
against angular velocity curves, as can be seen on the right panel, but also to highlight that
the predictions and measured quantities are indeed in very good agreement for arbitrary
conditions. For this purpose, the left panel exhibits the same pitch-rpm curves, but oriented
in such a way that the main diagonal plots, the top left and bottom right corners, can be
used to compared directly predicted and measured quantities of interest. In these plots, the
y=xcurves plotted in black dashed line indicates a perfect ﬁt, and, as can be seen, the
predictions closely match the registered values in the SCADA system, implying that both
the expressions and the methodology are validated.

5. Conclusions
In this work it was shown that the blades accelerations measurements contain relevant
information regarding both structural and operational conditions of the rotor. In particular,
it was shown that differential measurements between consecutive time instants can be
used to reproduce the SCADA system information, but with a much higher time resolution.
With this, it may be possible to either eliminate the need for high resolution information on
pitch angle and angular velocity or use it to monitor the SCADA system behaviour itself.
Although the full reconstruction of these conditions is only possible if the geometrical
angles of the rotor are known, it was also shown that, by carefully selecting setups with
constant angular velocities, these can also be constrained by the accelerations measurements
alone. In this case, it was shown that when any two orthogonal accelerations directions are
considered, their values trace an ellipsis over time whose parameters are directly related to
the geometrical characteristics of the rotor.
As a ﬁnal note, it should be mentioned that the presented analyses can only be
accomplished if the monitor layout includes accelerations measurements in the blades. This
was only possible due to usage of the FEUP developed wireless nodes, that were once more
shown to be a valid solution for the monitoring of this type of structures.
