Abstract
The unexpected failure of wind turbine components leads to significant downtime and loss of revenue. To prevent this, super -
visory control and data acquisition (SCADA) based condition monitoring is considered as a cost-effective approach. In several 
studies, the wind turbine power curve has been used as a critical indicator for power performance assessment. In contrast, 
the application of the blade pitch angle curve has hardly been explored for wind turbine condition monitoring purposes. The 
blade pitch angle curve describes the nonlinear relationship between pitch angle and hub height wind speed and can be used 
for the detection of faults. A support vector machine (SVM) is an improved version of an artificial neural networks (ANN) and 
is widely used for classification- and regression-related problems. Support vector regression is a data-driven approach based 
on statistical learning theory and a structural risk minimization principle which provides useful nonlinear system modeling. 
In this paper, a support vector regression (a nonparametric machine learning approach)-based pitch curve is presented and its 
application to anomaly detection explored for wind turbine condition monitoring. A radial basis function (RBF) was used as 
the kernel function for effective SVR blade pitch curve modeling. This approach is then compared with a binned pitch curve 
in the identification of operational anomalies. The paper will outline the advantages and limitations of these techniques.

Introduction
Increased demand for clean energy has led to the impressive 
expansion of global wind power installed capacity over the 
past decade. The newly installed wind turbines requires less 
maintenance cost but as it get old and out of warranty, then 
turbines maintenance cost increases significantly. Author of [ 1] 
pointed that of the total of 433 GW of wind capacity in 2015, 
the bulk of this was out of warranty which suggest a massive 
requirement for operation and maintenance (O&M). It is also 
well known that such costs are considerably higher for offshore 
wind turbines and in Ref. [ 1] it was found that improvement 
of O&M practice could lead to a reduction of 21% and 11% of the life-cycle costs of offshore and onshore wind farms, 
respectively. Furthermore, it is expected that the global wind 
O&M market will reach 20.6 billion US dollars by 2023. With 
the increase in age of wind turbines and the move to less acces -
sible offshore sites, the O&M cost is expected to grow sig -
nificantly, which reinforces the drive towards condition-based 
maintenance [ 2]. It is imperative to detect failures at an early 
stage to minimize downtime and maximize productivity, and 
condition-based maintenance has a crucial role to play in this.
Wind farms equipped with supervisory control and data 
acquisition (SCADA) systems provide data essential for reli -
able performance optimization [ 3]. Performance monitoring 
based on the available SCADA data is also a cost-effective 
approach to turbine condition appraisal, as confirmed by 
various literature reviews [ 4, 5] that highlight the feasibility 
of identifying turbine health status using SCADA data, and 
the vast potential of further enhancing the health monitoring 
function through sophisticated data analysis. SCADA-based 
monitoring of the condition of internal components of a 
wind turbine can be used to optimize maintenance activities

and thus reduce O&M costs and increase reliability and pro -
duction time; see [6 –9].
The power curve is widely used to assess the performance 
of a wind turbine; it signifies the nonlinear relationship 
between power production and hub height wind speed [10]. IEC-61400-12-2 [11] prescribes the method known as ‘bin-ning’ to calculate the power curve. The “method of bins” is a data reduction technique used to normalize the data to con-struct the measured power curve. This binned power curve includes the effect of the site turbulence and all other effects reflecting onsite conditions [12].
Nonparametric models are data driven, and their structure 
is not specified a priori but is obtained exclusively from the data [13]. Commonly used nonparametric models in wind tur -
bine condition monitoring are support vector machine (SVM), copulas, Gaussian process (GP) and other data derived mod-els; see [13– 15]. SCADA data record a large number of meas-
urements which make nonparametric models appropriate.
In the last decade, support vector machine (SVM), a novel 
and potent machine learning technique, has been success-fully used for classification- and regression-related problems. Support vector machine (SVM) based on the applications is categorized into support vector classification (SVC) and support vector regression (SVR). The SVM method uses a technique called ‘kernel trick’ to solve linear and nonlinear classification-related problems where its ability to deal with high dimensional data for a relatively small training set is satisfactory [16]. This allows replacement of the inner prod-uct (<x, y>) in an algorithm with a kernel (k (x, y)) and this 
approach is particularly valuable in a condition where it is more convenient to compute the kernel than the feature vector itself. Comparative studies [17] show that generalization of SVM to complex models is better than that for artificial neu-ral network (ANN), though it suffers from a more extended training time for large datasets. To deal with this, the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) approach proposed transforming complex quadratic programming into a linear problem; see [18]. SVM has demonstrated satisfactory per -
formance on regression and time-series prediction by solving the nonlinear relationship efficiently and stable across a range of applications; see examples [19–21]. The SVM model has been reported for short-term wind speed forecasting and yielded accurate results; see [ 22]. Comparative performance 
of SVM and multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks for wind speed prediction have been studied in [23], and the results suggest that the SVM approach outperforms the MLP model with respect to the root mean squared error (RMSE). Furthermore, SVM and neural network developed for short-term wind forecasting [24] indicate that SVM performance is superior. Li et al. [25] proposed a model based on SVM clas-sification to diagnose gearbox faults with promising results. In another paper [26], an SCADA-based SVM model was constructed for diagnosing and predicting wind turbine faults.Recently, the wind turbine condition monitoring stud-
ies have mostly focused on the power curve for evaluating performance. However, this cannot reflect the complete tur -
bine operation since the operational behavior of the wind turbines is profoundly influenced by a parameter such as a rotor power, torque, and pitch angle. Valid assessments of these parameters improve the power performance of a wind turbine. In this study, the blade pitch angle impact on wind turbine performance is analyzed using the blade pitch curve that reveals the nonlinear relationship between pitch angle and the hub height wind speed that can be useful for analyz-ing wind turbine performance and the detection of faults.
This paper proposed a novel support vector regression 
(SVR) approach to estimate wind turbine blade pitch curve and its application in anomaly detection for condition moni-toring. The binning method is a benchmark data reduction approach for the wind industries, but its application is gen-erally limited to the power curve. In this study, the binning method is applied to calculate the blade pitch curve. Finally, a comparative analysis of the binned blade pitch curve and support vector regression blade pitch curve is undertaken regarding fitting uncertainty and identifies the advantages and disadvantages of the SVR model.
This paper is structured as follows: The introduction is the 
first section. The next section describes the wind turbine per -
formance curves and air density corrections. The following section describes the SCADA dataset and its pre-processing. The next section outlines the methodologies and this section is further divided into subsections explaining support vector regression (SVR) and the binning approach to wind turbine blade pitch curve modeling. The next section presents the comparative analysis of proposed models and the last section concludes the paper.
Wind turbine performance curves
The power curve used to describes the strong dependency of power output of wind turbines on wind speed (Fig.  1) and 
widely used for power performance, warranty formulations, energy assessment, and fault detection applications. The power curve represents the nonlinear relationship between hub height wind speed and turbine output power and math-ematically expressed as [27]:
where ρ is the air density (kg/m
3), A is the swept area  (m2), 
Cp is the power coefficient of wind turbine and v  is the hub 
height wind speed (m/s). The tip speed ratio (λ ) and pitch 
angle (β ) affect the power coefficient and thus affect the 
power production of a wind turbine.(1) P=0.5/u1D70CACp(/u1D706,/u1D6FD)v3

Following the IEC standard (61400-12-1) [11], air den-
sity correction should be applied to a pitch-regulated wind 
turbine in which a corrected wind speed VC is calculated 
using Eqs. (2 ) and (3 ) as shown below
and 
where VC and VM are the corrected and measured wind speed 
in m/s and the corrected air density is calculated by Eq. (2 ) 
where B is atmospheric pressure in mbar and T the tem-
perature in Kelvin for which 10 min average values obtained 
from SCADA data are used. The corrected wind speed (VC) 
from Eq. (3 ) is then used to calculate the power curve nor -
mally by binning.
A typical blade pitch curve described the nonlinear rela-
tionship between turbine pitch angle and wind speed and shown in Fig.  2. Below the rated wind speed, the blade 
pitch angle is set to maximize power production. Beyond (2)

SCADA data for wind turbine performance 
curves
Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) sys-
tems record the operational status of wind turbines and are essential for reliable performance optimization. Perfor -
mance monitoring based on available SCADA data is also a cost-effective approach to turbine condition appraisal, as confirmed by various literature reviews that highlight the feasibility of identifying turbine health status using SCADA data, and the high potential of further enhancing the health monitoring function through sophisticated data analysis.
SCADA data sets used in this research are from a wind 
farm located in Scotland, UK, and cover a full year of oper -
ation with 10-min resolution. SCADA data reflect many aspects of a wind farm, from power output and wind speed to any error registered within the system, without any extra cost [28]. Furthermore, SCADA data analysis is essential for failure prognostics and the calculation of remaining life, along with diagnostic applications. However, SCADA data systems are not perfect; they can be affected by sen-sor error and data logging faults, and thus need careful pre-processing. The SCADA data used in this research are from a 2.3 MW Siemens turbine. Monthly data used for model training and testing purposes contain 4464 data points begin-ning with time stamp ‘‘1/7/2012 00:00 AM’’ and ending at time stamp ‘‘31/7/2012 23:50 PM’’. Using these data points, measured power and blade pitch curves are shown in Figs.  1 and 2  respectively. Filtering criteria described in 
[29], including timestamp mismatches, out of range values, 
negative power values, and turbine power curtailment have been applied to minimize misleading data. Using this filtra-tion approach, measured SCADA data sets were reduced by 626 from 4464 and used to develop a blade pitch curve using SVR and binning technique. The filtered and air density-corrected power and blade pitch curve are shown in Figs.  3 
and 4. Figure  5 shows a visual comparison between meas-
ured and pre-processed wind turbine blade pitch curves and suggest that the filtering applied here minimizes SCADA data errors (Table  1).   
Methodologies to be compared

Support vector regression‑based blade pitch curve
Support vector machine (SVM) is a nonparametric, machine 
learning approaches widely used in solvingcomplex and non-linear relationships between a high number of parameters. The SVM was first identified by Vapnik and his colleagues in 1992, [30], and gaining popularity due to its many attractive features, and promising results. Based on the applications, SVM is categorized into support vector classification (SVC) and support vector regression (SVR). The SVM regres -
sion theory is applied to model the blade pitch curve and is described below. A so-called dual SVR model deals better with high dimensions, in contrast to the standard approach and so will be considered here for blade pitch curve mod-eling [31]. A Lagrangian function of the primal function was developed by introducing nonnegative multipliers and for cal-culating the dual SVR, where the inner product of the pre-dictors was replaced by its corresponding element from the Gram matrix for an effective nonlinear SVR algorithm. The Gram matrix is an n -by-n matrix which contains elements; 
g
ij = G(xi, xj), where xi,xj are the training SCADA data points. 
This Lagrange dual formulation complements the nonlinear system and hence used in this study. A nonlinear SVR calcu-lates the optimal function f (x) in the transformed predictor 
space where the SVR looks for the coefficient that minimizes the Lagrangian function using the dual formula [32, 33]:
Under the following constraints:
The function f (x) used to fit the SVR model for blade 
pitch curve is given by
This specific SVR is called ɛ-SVR due to its scarcity rep -
resentation capability [34]. The ε-insensitive loss function 
is used to build the objective function of the ɛ  SVR. The 
v-SVR is another type of regression where v parameters are used to control the number of support vectors; see [35, 36]. (4)

The Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions play an impor -
tant role in dealing with constrained optimization and using 
KKT conditions [37]; of the quadratic programming, only a certain number of the coefficients (α
n−αn*) will assume 
nonzero values. The KKT complementarity conditions are optimization constraints required to obtain optimal solu -
tions, and for nonlinear SVM regression these conditions are
Parameter C determines the trade off between the model 
complexity (flatness) and the degree to which deviations larger than ɛ  are tolerated in optimization formulation [31]. 
Parameter ɛ controls the width of the ɛ -insensitive zone, 
used to fit the training data sets. It also affects the number of support vectors and hence is important for an effective 
blade pitch curve SVR model. In short, both  C and  ɛ affect 
SVR model performance and hence it is necessary to find 
optimal values for these parameters using appropriate opti-mization techniques. The calculation of ɛ  and C  is based 
on the nature of input datasets and choice of kernel. In this study, a Gaussian kernel was used and C  and  ɛ values were 
calculated as iqr(Y )/13.49 where iqr(Y ) is the interquartile 
range of the response variable Y  [33, 34]. The 13.349 is a 
rescaling factor (that quantifies the statistical dispersion in a set of numerical data) that reflects the change from inter -
quartile range to standard deviation. The calculated values of box constraint and epsilon are used in the wind turbine blade pitch curve modelling.
The bias ∊  is a part of the original primal formula of the 
SVR and is calculated from the following equation [31, 33]:∀n∶/u1D6FCn/parenleft.s1/u1D700+/u1D709n−yn+f/parenleft.s1xn/parenright.s1/parenright.s1=0;

∀n∶/u1D709∗
n/parenleft.s1C−/u1D6FC∗
n/parenright.s1=0.where αn and αn* are the nonnegative multipliers for each 
observation xn. The obtained biased value for this study is 
1.70 which is added into the SVR model to predict the blade pitch curve of wind turbine accurately.
The appropriate kernel makes SVR algorithm faster and 
involves computations in higher dimensional space. The Gaussian kernel is used in this study and mathematically is expressed as:
where γ is the kernel scale for given points x and x
′.
The Gaussian kernel is also popularly known by radial 
basis function (RBF) kernel and widely used. For example, 
the authors of [38] demonstrated that the use of SVR in hydrological modeling and they highlighted the excellent performance of the RBF.
The cross-validation of five folds is used to find the best 
value for kernel scale and to prevent overfitting [35]. The SCADA datasets described in “SCADA data for wind tur -
bine performance curves” were randomly shuffled and split into training and testing datasets for training and SVR model validations purposes, respectively.
Based on the SVR theory outlined above, a blade pitch 
curve model is proposed using a Gaussian kernel function and then compared with the measured blade pitch curve and is shown in Fig.  6. Figure  6 suggest that the support vector 
regression can fit the wind turbine pitch curve smoothly, however at higher wind speed, its accuracy suffers because of unavailability of sufficient data points. Furthermore, the accuracy of a support vector regression model depends on the quantity and quality of the data as well as the appropriate (6)

fitting method used. Furthermore, the estimated blade pitch 
angle as a function of time plotted and compared with the observed pitch angle, as in Fig.  7, suggests that SVR can 
estimate the pitch angle efficiently. Blade pitch failure may lead wind turbines to underperform, and an SVR model can help identify such failures through uncertainty analysis. 
Binned based blade pitch curve
The IEC 61400-12 standard describes the data reduction technique known as binning, typically using 0.5 m/s wide wind speed intervals. The power curve is a smooth curve drawn through these points, but in actuality is only defined precisely at the points themselves. In this study, binning methods are applied to calculate blade pitch curve using the following equations:
where V
i is the normalized and averaged wind speed in bin 
i, Vn,i,j is the normalized wind speed of data sets j  in bin i , Bi 
is the normalized and averaged pitch angle in bin i , Bn,i,j is 
the normalized pitch angle of data set j  in bin i , and Ni is the 
number of 10 min average data sets in bin i.
Figure  8 shows the reference binned blade pitch curve 
together with error bars. Type B uncertainties would be dif-
ficult to treat in a consistent manner without greater knowl-edge of the instrumentation used. Therefore, in this paper, we used the statistical spread evident in the binned data. The two standard deviations (i.e., 95% confidence intervals) of (8)

j=1Bn,i,jmeasured power values are used to calculate the error bars which are used to measure the uncertainty associated with each bin of the blade pitch curve. However, binning is not necessarily the most effective way to generate a pitch angle curve from wind speed and pitch angle data, since there is compromise being made for accuracy while choosing a bin width of 0.5 m/Sec. Within each bin, the measured power will depend strongly and non-linearly on wind speed, and a wide bin would result in a systematic bias; on the other hand, in practice, there must be a sufficient number of data points in each bin to be statistical significance [39]. The compara-tive analysis of binning and SVR models is described in the upcoming sections where the advantages and disadvantages of the individual methods are outlined.
Comparative analysis of binned pitch curve 
and SVR pitch curve
In this section, a comparative analysis of binned and SVR-
based pitch curves concludes that the support vector regres-sion fits the data well between a cut in and rated wind speeds,

but that the binned approach to fitting works well across the 
entire range of wind speed, as shown in Fig.  9. However, 
the binned pitch curve obtained from extensive measured data requires an extended measurement period to limit the uncertainty associated with the calculated pitch curve and is far too slow to be used directly for condition monitor -
ing where any changes in operation need to be identified quickly. Support vector regression is not limited in this way and hence can detect anomalies quickly. Thus, the support vector regression is preferred for detecting damage at an early stage.
Conclusion and discussion
This paper has proposed an SVM-based regression model for estimating the blade pitch angle curve. The estimated SVR pitch curve follows the standard variations, though due to the lack of data points in above rated wind speed, its accuracy suffers. This highlights how the quality and quantity of data points significantly affects the SVR model prediction accu-racy. SVR is then compared with the conventional approach based on a binned pitch curve together with individual bin probability distributions to identify operational anomalies. This comparative study yielded significant results. The SVR blade pitch curve closely follows the binned pitch curve, but above rated wind speed, there are fewer SCADA data values available and, as a result, the SVR curve is less well deter -
mined with some mismatch with the binned pitch curve. The major issue associated with wind turbine condition monitor -
ing is to detect a fault or failure as soon as possible and with limited computational time and processing power so that catastrophic damage due to failure can be prevented with a cost-effective approach. The comparative analysis illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques in context to anomaly detection and model uncertainty. This should support a wind farm operator in selecting the best method for wind turbine condition monitoring.
The future work is to develop and appropriate uncertainty 
analysis for the SVR blade pitch curve and then use it for developing a practical fault detection SVR algorithm.
