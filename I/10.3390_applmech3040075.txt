Abstract: Wind turbines are known to be the most efﬁcient method of green energy production, and
wind turbine blades (WTBs) are known as a key component of the wind turbine system, with a major
inﬂuence on the efﬁciency of the entire system. Wind turbine blades have a quite manual production
process of composite materials, which induces various types of defects in the blade. Blades are
susceptible to the damage developed by complex and irregular loading or even catastrophic collapse
and are expensive to maintain. Failure or damage to wind turbine blades not only decreases the
lifespan, efﬁciency, and fault diagnosis capability but also increases safety hazards and maintenance
costs. Hence, non-destructive testing (NDT) methods providing surface and subsurface information
for the blade are indispensable in the maintenance of wind turbines. Damage detection is a critical
part of the inspection methods for failure prevention, maintenance planning, and the sustainability
of wind turbine operation. Industry 4.0 technologies provide a framework for deploying smart
inspection, one of the key requirements for sustainable wind energy production. The wind energy
industry is about to undergo a signiﬁcant revolution due to the integration of the physical and virtual
worlds driven by Industry 4.0. This paper aims to highlight the potential of Industry 4.0 to help
exploit smart inspections for sustainable wind energy production. This study is also elaborated by
damage categorization and a thorough review of the state-of-the-art non-destructive techniques for
surface and sub-surface inspection of wind turbine blades.
Keywords: non-destructive testing (NDT); smart inspection; wind turbine blades (WTBs) ;
smart maintenance planning; industry 4.0; digital twins (DT)
1. Introduction
Wind energy, which has been booming for more than a decade, accounts for a signiﬁ-
cant percentage of the global energy market. In its latest report for 2021, the Global Wind
Energy Council (GWEC) indicates a total capacity of 743 GW of wind turbines installed
in the world, of which there were 93 GW of new installations in 2020 alone; among these,
86.9 GW of turbines were installed on land (onshore) and 6.1 GW were installed at sea
(offshore) [ 1]. All these turbines have to operate under various conditions, including salt
water, sand particles, insects, lightning, ultraviolet rays, icing, and hot or cold temperatures,
depending on the geographical location of the wind-power installations. These factors
have an impact on the structure, and the wind turbines must also be regularly inspected to
ensure that they are functioning properly and, therefore, producing the estimated energy

and meeting the electricity demand. In other words, the inspection can be used to detect
the defects in a structure before a failure occurs and prevent stops to energy production.
Wind turbines are increasingly used in northern regions because these regions are
characterized by their high wind potential [ 2]. Therefore, the technology has to adapt to the
harsh climatic conditions, including extreme temperatures and icing (the phenomenon of
ice accumulation on the blades of wind turbines) which, among other things, complicates
the operation and maintenance of turbines in these locations [ 3,4]. However, wind farm
operators prefer to mitigate the risks rather than avoid these regions, since they contain the
greatest wind potential on the planet [ 4,5]. When wind turbines are operated in northern
regions’ environmental conditions or the mounts, the blades and turbines are also subject
to extreme temperatures and icing. Extreme temperatures affect the material used to
manufacture the blades, and the blades can become brittle at very low temperatures, crack,
or suffer from other damage due to extreme temperatures. Wind-turbine manufacturers
are currently able to propose solutions to the severe temperature constraints induced by
extreme temperatures in the design, manufacturing, operation, and maintenance (O&M) of
wind turbines [ 6,7]. The vast majority of problems related to cold weather are, therefore,
due to the accumulation of ice on wind turbines [ 8]. This ice accumulation on the blades
increases the stress on the blades, causes signiﬁcant vibrations that lead to material fatigue,
and can also cause damage [ 9]. Therefore, to ensure sustainable operational conditions in
northern climates, the proper choice of blade material is necessary, as well as an appropriate
design and manufacturing process, adapted to the harsh winter conditions, and the ability
to withstand additional loads due to ice accumulation on the blades. In addition, regular
inspection is necessary to ensure the good condition of the blades, detect cracks and failures
in time to react and plan repairs, and to ensure the proper functioning of the blades and,
consequently, maintain expected energy production.
Canada, as one of the coldest countries in the world, has one of the highest wind-
energy potentials in the world. The provinces with the highest wind-energy production
are Ontario, Qu ébec, and Alberta. According to CanWEA, in Canada, the 12,239 MW
of installed capacity translates into 6409 wind turbines and, therefore, 19,227 blades that
require regular inspection and maintenance. Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta share 2515, 1879,
and 901 installed wind turbines, respectively; thus, they have 7545, 5637, and 2703 blades,
respectively, to inspect and maintain [ 10]. According to the Government of Quebec [ 11],
the province had 3879 MW of installed wind-power capacity in 2020 (i.e., 1935 turbines
integrated and connected to the Hydro-Quebec grid) and is expected to have 3933 MW of
wind power by 2022. Therefore, a large number of wind turbines are installed and operated
under harsh climatic conditions (i.e., icing and very low temperatures), whose inspection
is necessary and of high importance to ensure proper functioning during winter periods
(where there is a surplus of production) and to ensure energy production while reducing
energy losses.
This article presents the most important aspects of the inspection of wind turbine
blades. Geometric non-destructive methods are presented and discussed to provide an
exhaustive guide to the inspection and, consequently, the maintenance of wind turbines.
General aspects of wind turbine blade inspection are presented in Section 2, followed by a
survey on their manufacturing and operational conditions in Sections 3 and 4. Surface and
subsurface inspection of blades are discussed in Sections 5 and 6, with the inspection sensor
technologies presented in Section 7. The presented inspection methods are compared in
Section 8, introducing industry 4.0 tools in the operational practice (Section 9). The article
ends with a conclusion on inspection methods, tools and challenges.
2. Inspection of Wind T urbine Blades
As wind turbine installations increase, along with operating constraints and climatic
conditions that affect the structure and can cause damage, the inspection of the blades and
the wind turbine structure becomes an important part of their preventive maintenance.
The O&M of wind turbine blades (WTBs) consists of 15–35% of the total costs and the
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Appl. Mech. 2022 ,3 1301
minimization of these costs is very important. The inspection of WTBs is essential to prevent
damages that could appear on the blade and diminish its aerodynamic properties, thereby
harming the harvesting of wind energy and reducing electricity production. Therefore,
keeping the blades in a suitable condition is essential to prolong the lifespan of WTB
and maximize performance. It should be noted that an inspection is used to identify the
defects in a structure and, in this research, the selected structure is the WTB. If not repaired,
these defects can lead to loss of efﬁciency and, in the worst case, fatal failure [ 12]. In
addition, wind turbines are often installed in remote sites with difﬁcult access (onshore
in the mountains or offshore). Moreover, the blades are ﬁxed on the rotor at a height of
100 m or more. WTBs are difﬁcult to access, with risky conditions during inspection that
makes it even more complex and costly. In addition, winter weather makes inspection
increasingly problematic. Health and safety concerns are also raised when inspecting these
wind turbines. Therefore, it is necessary to plan and organize an inspection plan to ensure
the ongoing operation and maintenance (O&M) of the turbines in harsh winter conditions.
Typically, the inspection involves an employee turning the turbine blades downwards.
Another employee climbs to the top of the tower and then rappels down the blade to
visually inspect the surface of the blade and possibly take photos of any defects that are
encountered. This process must be repeated for each blade and may take from 2 to 4 h
depending on the quality of the defects being documented [ 12]. According to CNESST, three
employees (one on the ground, two at altitude) are required for wind-turbine inspections
and repairs (i.e., climbing and repairing) and favorable climatic conditions are necessary
to climb to a height. Therefore, the use of an automated or semi-automated inspection
solution is essential. This could replace a repetitive and dangerous task when executed
by humans (manual inspection is performed either in elevation by rope or by platform)
and make it better organized and more achievable using digital technologies (camera, laser,
etc.), allowing for safe imaging of the structure.
In general, the blades are inspected approximately once every ﬁve years during the
manufacturer’s warranty period, after which they are inspected every two years [ 13]. When
the turbine is operating in a northern environment, additional stresses are added, which
can cause damage to the blade. Therefore, it is recommended to inspect the blades more
frequently, e.g., annually. The inspection of WTBs is costly, as it must be carried out at
height and under favorable climatic conditions (the wind turbine must be shut down
during the inspection). Therefore, operators are looking for fast, reliable, and low-cost
inspection services that allow for the operator to prioritize the maintenance activities and
evaluate the material and human resources, as well as ﬁnd the most convenient time
to repair defects that were identiﬁed. This is smart inspection and smart maintenance
planning. In this study, various inspection methods that are applicable to the blades of
wind turbines in operation will be presented. These methods will be compared based on
the following criteria: speed, quality/reliability, and cost. Before presenting these different
WTB inspection methods, the methods and materials used to manufacture WTBs will also
be presented, followed by the loads applied to the blades and the possible damage. First,
the wind turbine blade with some nomenclatures will be brieﬂy presented.
3. Manufacturing, Load Types, Damages, and Standards of Wind T urbine Blade
The wind is harvested through wind turbines, which generate electricity by rotating
the blades attached to the rotor, which is attached to the nacelle at the top of the tower, as
shown in Figure 1.

A wind turbine blade is made of two parts, the lower and upper surface, which are 
connected and stiffened with one or more shear webs that connect the upper and lower 
parts of the blade shell [15] , as shown in F igure 2. This figure illustrates the cross- section

In terms of loading configuration, one of the main laminate s of the main spar under-

with the gravity loads undergo tension– compression loads [1 7]. The flap load is caused 
by wind pressure, and the edge load is due to gravitational forces and torque load.

very manual, leadin g to different types of defects. Hence, non -destructive testing is re-
quired to provide information on the surface and sub -surface of the blade while demon-
strating the ability to inspect the blade from the surface [18]. Early types of WTBs were 
manufactured  by wet hand lay- up technology (Figure 3a). Fiberglass was impregnated 
with rollers and brushes. After being j oined by adhesive, the shells are connected to the 
stringers. The cloths for the larger blades are sandwiched using the same approach but 
with a higher plies’ fiber content. As shown in Figure 3b , product quality improved with

the prepreg approach. The prepreg technology was developed by aerospace productions,
using impregnated composite ﬁbers. Resin infusion technology was adopted for large
turbine blades by positioning the ﬁbers in a closed mold; then, the resin is pumped into

technique can be classiﬁed as resin transfer molding and vacuum-assisted transfer molding

aerospace productions, using impregnated composite fibers. Resin infusion technology 
was adop ted for large turbine blades by positioning the fibers in a closed mold ; then , the

Various materials are used to  manufactur e WTBs, but the applicability of these ma-
terials depends on their weight and stiffness. As shown in Figure 4 , composite fibers have 
adequate strength and stiffness. Despite their high strength and stiffness, composites are 
lightweight in essence. The fiber orientation in a laminate governs the characteristic be-
havior of the composite. Therefore, composite materials are usually the preferred choice 
of material for the manufacturing of WTBs [19]. Furthermore, experimental studies 
demonstrate that a low temperature increa ses the stiffness and compressive strength of 
CF/CPTSP. Conversely,  higher temperatures may cause diminishing mechanical proper-
ties in composites [20].

3.2. Damages in Wind Turbine Blades  
The d efects encountered on a wind turbine blade can originate from  the design, man-
ufacturing, handling, operation, or repair. A defect might also have been created for  mul-
tiple other reaso ns [21-23]. Poor design, i.e.,  underestimation of loads and poor defect 
characterization , can lead to damage during operation or handling (during transport of 
the blade). The manufacturing process of WTBs is not very automated and,  despite the 
rigor applie d in the quality control, some defects on the blades can escape the intiail in-
spections in a factory. In this case, a  dry fiber or a ratio rich in fiber can lead to local de-
lamination. While h andling the blades either during transportation (often over long  dis-
tances) or during installation by crane, the blades can be subjected to shocks or compres-
sions, causing scratches, and chipping (on the leading or trailing edge). Once in operation, 
the blade is subjected to multiple potential causes of wear or failure , including leading 
edge erosion, lightning strikes, frost, particles from agricultural land, ultraviolet radiation, 
salt air, birds, and insects. Poorly executed repairs can lead to new defects or more severe damage.  
As explained earlier, a good understan ding of the causes of deterioration of compo-
site WTBs is crucial to the life of the blades. This  is of great significance , since the blades 
are subjected to different loadings. Defects in  composite materials ending in the deterio-
ration of composites have b een extensively studied . Figure 5 presents significant infor-
mation on the different deterioration mechanisms resulting from the action of loads.

3.2. Damages in Wind Turbine Blades
The defects encountered on a wind turbine blade can originate from the design,
manufacturing, handling, operation, or repair. A defect might also have been created for
multiple other reasons [ 21–23]. Poor design, i.e., underestimation of loads and poor defect
characterization, can lead to damage during operation or handling (during transport of the
blade). The manufacturing process of WTBs is not very automated and, despite the rigor
applied in the quality control, some defects on the blades can escape the intiail inspections
in a factory. In this case, a dry ﬁber or a ratio rich in ﬁber can lead to local delamination.
While handling the blades either during transportation (often over long distances) or
during installation by crane, the blades can be subjected to shocks or compressions, causing

WTBs is crucial to the life of the blades. This is of great signiﬁcance, since the blades are
subjected to different loadings. Defects in composite materials ending in the deterioration
of composites have been extensively studied. Figure 5 presents signiﬁcant information on
the different deterioration mechanisms resulting from the action of loads.

As the material properties are not constant in all directions for composite materials,
the mechanisms of deterioration are more complicated. Furthermore, when subjected to
transient loading, the resulting stresses are not uniformly distributed over the material.
That is not the case for metals, as they are inherently ductile and preserve their toughness
even during deformation. Composites, however, are brittle and particularly vulnerable
to damage as they are subjected to variable loading. As composites are subjected to
variable loading, the matrix is most susceptible to shear cracking. Flexural cracking is
likely to occuras the lower part of the composite is subjected to bending load. There is
also a possibility of delamination (Figure 6) as the cracks are conﬁned. The ﬁber also
could be damaged by tension, in addition to buckling, when subjected to compressive
stresses. Two principal damage modes that often occur in low-energy impact conditions
are resin cracking and matrix interfacial deterioration. Fiber failure is the dominant failure
mechanism in high-energy impact conditions. The fracture toughness is, however, inferior
to brittle resin systems. Here are some examples of the most common defects found on
wind turbine blades. It should be noted that these are surface defects [20–28]:
 Erosion: Wear caused by high-speed collisions between airborne particles and the
blade (hailstones, water droplets, sand, insects). Leading edge erosion due to impact
fatigue is a serious issue for wind turbine blades, which might be caused by a variety
of factors, including collision with rain droplets, hail stones, and other airborne
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

particles. Repeated impacts to the leading edge cause an accumulation of damage and,
eventually, cracking of the tip of the material;
 Dry ﬁber: An area in the laminate where there is no resin, resulting in a different
coloration. The stack of compressed dry laminate experiences the full pressure of the
atmosphere—just like the open top of the resin pot, which is about to infuse. The
infusion process is such that the atmosphere acts almost like a piston on the resin pot,
pushing it down, then through the hose into the low-pressure area inside the bag. This
is like pushing down on the plunger of a syringe and injecting the resin into the part
just the plunger is the atmospheric pressure;
 Delamination: Separation of the laminate layers due to poor infusion at the mill,
regarded as one of the most common forms of failure of composite materials. Due
to imperfections initiated by the manufacturing process or external factors during
the lifetime of composite laminates, i.e., foreign body impact, the phenomenon of
delamination can occur;
 Cracks: Breakage of the laminate or glue joint. Even if it seems harmless, a crack should
never be overlooked, since it may be larger in size and may propagate (Figure 7).
Mmechanical fasteners (such as clips, screws, etc.) can be used to join composites or
mixed materials, but they require additional steps to mold or create features for the
fastener. These additional features eventuate in stress concentrations and non-uniform
stress distribution, which can result in cracking and failure;
 Cracking: Grouping of several cracks located at the root of the blade and along the
leading edge and surfaces, opposite the spars;
 Microcracks: Cracks (or spalling Figures 6 and 7) are often thinner than the gelcoat
caused by poor infusion at the factory. They are difﬁcult to detect, and their observation
depends on the inspector’s perception. In the case of hardening as a consequence of
microcracking, the relative displacement of the microcrack faces over loading and
unloading cycles causes them to grow;
 Blistering: Poor adhesion of the gelcoat to the laminate, causing local delamination of
the coating. Adhesion failure happens when the adhesive fails to attach ﬁrmly to the
substrate, which can be perceived as it is separated cleanly from the surface. It should
be noted that adhesion occurs in very delicate regions of the surface;
 Deep cavity: A cavity that reaches one or more layers from the surface;
 Scratches: Damage, superﬁcial or not, to the surface of the blade;
 Pitting: Cavities of less than one millimeter, produced by poorly executed or controlled
application of the gelcoat;
 Spalling: Partial (ﬂaking) or complete (exposed laminate) disbondment of the gelcoat.

3.3. Damage and Defect Categorization in Wind Turbine Blades  
The a ssessment of detected wind turbine blade damage usually involves determining 
its severity and/or criticality. This process helps to categorize observed wind turbine blade 
damages into common severity categories. The c ategorization of damage and defects in 
wind turbine blades is a challenging task that lacks guidance in the form of an industry 
standard. However, categorization enables decisions on the maintenance actions, execu-
tion, and timing of repairs, considering practical and commercial concerns such as season, 
accessibility, the impact of downtime, and the availability of crews and materials. To as-
sess the damages and defects of different blades, categories 1 –5 are presented as potential 
answers. Categories 1 and 2 are considered for minor damage or defect, categories 3 and 
Figure 6. (a) Delamination, ( b) Crack in the glue joint [29].

3.3. Damage and Defect Categorization in Wind Turbine Blades  
The a ssessment of detected wind turbine blade damage usually involves determining 
its severity and/or criticality. This process helps to categorize observed wind turbine blade 
damages into common severity categories. The c ategorization of damage and defects in 
wind turbine blades is a challenging task that lacks guidance in the form of an industry 
standard. However, categorization enables decisions on the maintenance actions, execu-
tion, and timing of repairs, considering practical and commercial concerns such as season, 
accessibility, the impact of downtime, and the availability of crews and materials. To as-
sess the damages and defects of different blades, categories 1 –5 are presented as potential 
answers. Categories 1 and 2 are considered for minor damage or defect, categories 3 and

and timing of repairs, considering practical and commercial concerns such as season,
accessibility, the impact of downtime, and the availability of crews and materials. To
assess the damages and defects of different blades, categories 1–5 are presented as potential
answers. Categories 1 and 2 are considered for minor damage or defect, categories 3 and 4
for moderate damage or defect, and category 5 for major damage or defect. In some cases
where multiple defects are present, lower-category defects may be grouped to form higher-
category defects. Further, it may be cost-efﬁcient to monitor several lower-category defects
as single, higher-category defects. Recategorization is generally needed for lower category
damage and defects [32].
Category 1–3 damage or defects can often be operated with inspections every
6–12 months. Category 3 or 4 damage or defect should be repaired or shut down within
6–12 months, with at least an inspection every 6 months. Category 4 or 5 damage or defect
should be repaired or shut down within 1–12 months, with monthly monitoring. Only the
most severe damage and defects are considered serious enough to stop the turbine until
it can be repaired. Moderate and less serious damage can be monitored once or twice a
year with ongoing operation. For lower damage and defect categoriess, growth would

Standards for Rotor Blades of Wind Turbines
 
Rotor blades 
should 
be designed so that the maintenance of normal operating condi-
tions 
is
 
ensured. The rotor blades should also reach the expected lifetime with sufficiently 
high reliability. In addition, the safety of personnel and installations must be ensured and 
risks of 
injury to human life must be reduced to a minimum. The rotor blade standards 
deliver an internationally acceptable level of safety by defining minimum requirements 
for wind turbine
 
rotor blade
s (in combination with referenced standards, recommended 
practic
es, guidelines, etc.). These standards serve as a design basis for designers, suppli-
ers, manufacturers, purchasers, and regulators to specify requirements for wind turbines 
subject to certification schemes. The design basis 
is
 
sufficient for a safe design 
of the wind 
turbine rotor blade covering the scope of certification specified as part of the design basis. 
Design load assumptions that are used as a basis for the design verification of the blade 
structure sh
ould
 
be specified as part of the design documen
tation. In case of changes in 
the design loads, a load comparison may be carried out to show that the blade continues 
to be compliant with the standard requirements. 
 
The 
DNV GL standard, for instance, provides principles and technical requirements 
for rot
or blades for wind turbines
 
both
 
onshore and offshore. This standard is, in princi-
ple, applicable to all types of wind turbines and rotor blades, even though many require-
ments have been formulated specifically for blades made from fiber
-
reinforced compo-
sit
es for operation on horizontal
-
axis wind turbines. 
The 
DNV GL standard can be applied 
as part of the technical basis for carrying out DNV
-
GL
-
type certification of wind turbines 
or DNV GL component certification of rotor blades. This standard is 
applicable to the 
structural and functional design and manufacturing of rotor blades for wind turbines, in-
cluding requirements for materials, testing, repair, and operation [33].
 
For all processes involving polymeric materials, the manufacturing processes 
to be 
applied in connection with each material sh
ould
 
be reported in a generic process descrip-
tion. For fiber
-
reinforced composites, these sh
ould
 
at least include:
 

 
Type of processing (hand lay

3.4. Standards for Rotor Blades of Wind Turbines
Rotor blades should be designed so that the maintenance of normal operating condi-
tions is ensured. The rotor blades should also reach the expected lifetime with sufﬁciently
high reliability. In addition, the safety of personnel and installations must be ensured and
risks of injury to human life must be reduced to a minimum. The rotor blade standards
deliver an internationally acceptable level of safety by deﬁning minimum requirements
for wind turbine rotor blades (in combination with referenced standards, recommended
practices, guidelines, etc.). These standards serve as a design basis for designers, suppli-
ers, manufacturers, purchasers, and regulators to specify requirements for wind turbines
subject to certiﬁcation schemes. The design basis is sufﬁcient for a safe design of the wind
turbine rotor blade covering the scope of certiﬁcation speciﬁed as part of the design basis.
Design load assumptions that are used as a basis for the design veriﬁcation of the blade
structure should be speciﬁed as part of the design documentation. In case of changes in the
design loads, a load comparison may be carried out to show that the blade continues to be
compliant with the standard requirements.
The DNV GL standard, for instance, provides principles and technical requirements
for rotor blades for wind turbines both onshore and offshore. This standard is, in principle,
applicable to all types of wind turbines and rotor blades, even though many requirements
have been formulated speciﬁcally for blades made from ﬁber-reinforced composites for
operation on horizontal-axis wind turbines. The DNV GL standard can be applied as
part of the technical basis for carrying out DNV-GL-type certiﬁcation of wind turbines
orDNV GL component certiﬁcation of rotor blades. This standard is applicable to the
structural and functional design and manufacturing of rotor blades for wind turbines,
including requirements for materials, testing, repair, and operation [33].
For all processes involving polymeric materials, the manufacturing processes to be
applied in connection with each material should be reported in a generic process description.
For ﬁber-reinforced composites, these should at least include:
 Type of processing (hand lay-up, infusion, pultrusion, prepreg, or others);
 Principle of vacuum set-up and level of applied differential pressure;
 Most relevant processing temperature proﬁles, at least including application tempera-
ture and time, and cure temperature and time (or a deﬁnition of a minimum required
degree of curing to be achieved by the curing process for each resin system);
 Target ﬁber volume content.
For adhesive joints, these shall at least include:
 Type of processing (co-curing, co-bonding, adhesive bonding, or others);
 Maximum and minimum thickness of adhesive joint;
 Most relevant surface preparation parameters (peel-ply , grinding, protection, open time);
 Most relevant processing temperature proﬁles, at least including application tempera-
ture and time, and cure temperature and time (or a deﬁnition of a minimum required
degree of curing to be achieved by the curing process for each resin system).
The manufacturer shall ensure that each rotor blade is produced in accordance with the
speciﬁed materials and the design assumptions. The manufacturing of wind turbine blades
shall be carried out according to appropriate documentation, at least including approved
work instructions, drawings, and quality procedures. Such documents shall cover the scope
of all relevant manufacturing processes. The manufacturer is responsible for ensuring
that all tests and inspections are laid down in accordance with the standard, and that any
standards, speciﬁcations and other applicable regulations are carried out. Quality control of
ﬁber-reinforced composite production comprises control of the raw material, surveillance
during production, and checking the quality of the ﬁnished components.
The operator of a wind turbine shall ensure that, as long as it is in operation, the
installed rotor blades are inspected and maintained on a regular basis. Inspections and
maintenance shall take place at regular time intervals and be based on the procedures
speciﬁed by the original blade manufacturer (e.g., in manuals). The detailed technical scope
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Appl. Mech. 2022 ,3 1309
of inspections and maintenance shall be speciﬁed by the original blade manufacturer as
part of their documentation. These should at least include [33]:
 Outer surface quality;
 Structural integrity of laminates, from the outer as well as the inner surface;
 Adhesive joints at leading and trailing edge;
 Adhesive joints on the inside (such as shear web joints);
 Attached items (e.g., lightning protection);
 Lightning events;
 Corrosion and pre-tension of bolts;
 Mechanisms or installed systems, if applicable.
The article detail the methods used to inspect the blade’s outer surface and sub-surface
to ensure the maintenance and operation of the wind turbines in order to produce the
estimated energy over the expected lifetime.
4. Inspection Methods of Wind T urbine Blades in Operation
The deﬁnition of inspection is to move a sensor (e.g., camera) to collect information
over the entire surface. The purpose of an inspection is to detect defects. Leaving these
defects can result in loss of efﬁciency and, in the worst case, the failure of the structure
or component. In this study, we are talking about failure of the blade, which is the main
component of the wind turbine. Without blades, the wind turbine would not be able to
harness energy from the wind and, therefore, would not be able to generate electricity. The
ﬁrst inspection of WTBs is carried out after manufacturing and during quality control in
the factory. Once the blades are in service and operation, this is called ﬁeld inspection.
The inspection methods used in the factory differ from those used in the ﬁeld. In the
factory, a full inspection can be performed, that is, on and under the surface of the blade,
allowing for the detection of defects on the surface and in-depth. Conducing this form
of inspection in the ﬁeld is much more complicated. In the case of ﬁeld inspection, the
inspection is carried out to prevent major failures and ensure the aerodynamic performance
of the blades. In addition, an inspection of blades ensures that the manufacturer’s warranty
is honored. Once defects are detected by a camera or other methods, they must be located
(park, turbine, blade, distance from root, GPS point) and categorized, either automatically,
through image processing, or manually by a technician. Various geolocation methods,
including laser rangeﬁnders, sonar, and GPS-equipped drones are currently available on the
market. Although there are several publications on the subject, automatic defect detection
from blade images is still under development [34].
Many of the currently available inspection methods can only be implemented in the
factory. Moreover, among the few methods that are applicable to already-installed blades,
some only allow for the surface to be evaluated (surface inspection), while others allow for
the subsurface structure to be evaluated at greater or lesser depths (subsurface inspection).
These methods are referred to as non-destructive methods [ 34,35]. In this article, surface
inspection methods will be presented, followed by subsurface inspection methods. The use
of sensors installed on the blade will also be presented, allowing for the prediction of failure
in advance before it occurs; in other words, this method will be used to detect defects.
5. Surface Inspection
The inspection methods on the surface of the blades allow for the detection of external
defects (cracks, erosion, lightning damage, disbonding of glue joint at the leading or trailing
edge, etc.), but do not allow for the detection of internal defects, even in the case where
some of these defects are manifested on the surface. The methods of inspection on the
surface are as follows:
 Visual inspections by workers (on a rope, on a platform suspended from a basket, or
on an elevated platform, as shown in Figures 8 and 9);
 Visual inspections from the ground with binoculars or telescope;
 Visual inspections with a camera from the ground or a drone;
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

 automatically, through image processing, or manually by a technician. Various geoloca-
tion met hods, including laser rangefinders, sonar, and GPS -equipped drones are currently 
available on the market. Although there are several publications on the subject, automatic 
defect detection from blade images is still under development [34].  
Many of the  currently available inspection methods can only be implemented in the

tion). These methods are referred to as non -destructive methods [34 ,35]. In this article, 
surface inspection methods will be presented,  followed by subsurface inspection meth-
ods. The use of sensors installed on the blade will also be presented, allowing for the pre-
diction of failure in advance before it occurs ; in other words, this method will be used to 
detect defects. 
5. Surface Inspection  
The inspection methods on the surface  of the blades allow for the detection of exter-
nal defects (cracks, erosion, lightning damage, disbonding of glue joint at the leading or 
trailing edge, . etc.), but do not allow for the detection of internal defects, even in the case 
where some of these defects are manifested on the surface. The methods of inspection on 
the surface are as  follow s: 
• Visual inspections by workers (on a rope, on a platform suspended from a basket, or 
on an elevated platform,  as shown in Figure s 8 and 9); 
• Visual inspections from  the ground with binoculars or telescope;  
• Visual inspections with a camera from the ground or a drone;  
  
(a) (b) 
Figure 8. Visual inspection on platform ( a), on rope ( b) [36]. 
Visual inspection by a rope or platform worker (Figure 9 ) is very time -consuming 
(requires several hours of inspection for each blade and the turbine is shut down the entire time) ; it is possible to repair the defect on -site, but it is expensive. Visual inspection from 
the grou nd is also very time -consuming. Visual inspection from a drone is very fast and 
safe for the worker. Although the various manual inspection methods  that have been  used 
to date are able to detect and characterize several defect  categorie s on a blade, they remain 
time -consuming and expensive. Some of these methods, such as rope inspection, pose 
safety risks for workers. However, the use of remote inspection methods using drones, which are more flexible, faster, more economical, and safer, can limit the number of

 defects detected by inspection or affect their classification. Despite these constraints, 
drone inspection has undeniable advantages. Studies conducted with different industrial 
stakeholders have shown that the use of remote- inspection methods using dr ones has in-
deed the advantage of providing a quick and cost -effective idea of the number of defects 
and their distribution for a wind farm. Although the use of drones does not have the same accuracy, all agree that it allows for  the inspection of a greater number of blades at the 
same time, limiting direct interventions to only those needed for repairs. In this respect, 
the use of drones could revolutionize field inspection.

5.1. Machine Vision  
Computer vision -based detection methods use 2D/3D image sequences from differ-
ent locations to capture object information, which is akin to the stereoscopic vision of hu-mans. Computer  vision -based detection technology delivers surface damage detection 
such as cracks, scratches, etc. A schematic of the computer vision -based detection technol-
ogy is shown in Figure 10. The figure illustrates the binocular vision detection method , 
which obtains information by acquiring images from different perspectives according to 
para llax principles. The detection steps include image acquisition, image processing, and 
damage identification. This method places great demands on imaging equipment and 
data processing, particularly for online monitoring. This technology can also lessen haz-
ardous tasks being conducted at height in a wind farm by human workers [37].

5.2. Inspection by Drone  
Inspection drones can be equipped with different kinds of sensors and cameras , such 
as RGB, IR, LIDAR, multi, and hyperspectral. Multiple sensors can even be integrated to 
develop multi- scale inspection systems, thereby reducing the number of flights required 
to complete a single job. Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensors use laser -emitted 
light energy to scan the blade and produce high -resolution 3D models of objects. Drone -
based hyperspectral sensors collect data as a series of narrow and contiguous wavelength bands providing a high level of performance in spectral and radiometric accuracy. Drone 
inspections can also include damage review and access to cloud -based processing ob-
tained by LIDAR sensors. There are only a few techniques that are capable of detecting sub-surface damages; even multi -spectral cameras can scan about a  2–3 cm sub -surface; 
this requires the drone to be relatively close (1 0–15 cm), which,  from an operation point 
of view, can carry risks to the blades, the high -value assets.  
Visual inspection by a drone can be used with or without automated image pro-
cessin g, and with or without automated defect detection. This inspection is also quick and 
safe, allowing for access to restricted areas (Figure 11). Drones enable safe and efficient 
inspection to collect data for energy companies. Using drones for wind turbine inspections 
opens up new opportunities to replace existing inspections with shorter inspection times, 
lower labor costs, and fewer unsafe working hours , while providing high- quality data. 
Without drones, inspections are usually performed  manually by climbi ng or using long-
range photography. It is clear that the manual inspections associated with climbing carry 
risks that drones avoid. The collecti on of  ground -based data can be slow and fails to pro-
vide detailed information compared to t hat which drones can capture. Due to the ir many 
advantages, the use of drones for turbine inspection is becoming more common. the in-
spection of the blade surfaces by a drone can be carried out in 15 min, i.e., 45 min for the 
3 blades, plus 30 min to change the battery of the d rone and to turn the rotor, to which 15 
min must be added for the displacement between two wind turbines. Therefore, a full 
inspection of the blades of a wind turbine can be completed in 1 h30 under good condi-
tions. In general, the following benefits can b e achieved using drone inspection [38]:  
• More accurate;  
• Improved operations ; 
• Safety and efficiency ; 
• Complete site assessment .

5.3. Offshore Wind Turbines Inspection  
Remote geographical locations and  the positioning of critical parts of a WT, for ex-
ample, its nacelle and blades, make it unique and challenging for servicing and mainte-
nance, especially offshore sites for transporting wind farm technicians and other person-
nel by Crew Transfer Vessels (CTVs).  The environment inside the nacelle of the offshore 
WTs is different from that of the onshore WTs. The ambient temperature inside the on-shore WT nacelle, operating, for example, in the Saharan climate, can be  in a wide range 
from −40 °C to +55 °C. This cou ld be problematic when selecting the materials, for exam-
ple, when finding  electronic equipment that can  operate in such a range. The condition 
could be worsened for the offshore WTs because of the need for an air- tight nacelle unit 
to minimize the inflow of corrosive outer air and other  corrosive marine elements (e.g., 
salt spray or fog). This could lead to an increase in the internal temperature inside the 
nacelle , such as in the generator part, which could go up to 150  °C when the cooling sys-
tem is not ad equately installed. The remote location and position of offshore wind turbine 
structures severely limit s the application of in situ corrosion detection methods such as 
ultrasonic, acoustic emission, and X -ray. This leads to the requirement of technology de-
velopment for a cost -effective end- to-end nondestructive testing (NDT) corrosion detec-
tion and monitoring solution for offshore WTs. This can be achieved through the imple-mentation of real -time remote sensing (RTRS) technology utilizing electrochemical sen-
sors, as there are limitations with the use of in situ techniques,  such as ultrasonic, acoustic 
emission, and X -ray with regard to access for operators and the power source. The elec-
trochemical sensors could instead  be used to remotely m onitor the physical and electro-
chemical changes that take place on the metallic materials [39].  
6. Subsurface Inspection  
There are several methods for inspecting subsurface blades. Some are applied at the 
factory and others are applied to blades in operati on. These are non- destructive testing 
NDT methods that obtain information from the surface and inside the WTBs. These meth-ods include but are not limited to thermography, X -ray imaging, 3D laser inspection, and 
ultrasonic testing [40]. Multi-  and hyper -spectral cameras have also been used to detect 
subsurface damage.  
6.1. Thermography  
Thermography is frequently applied to monitor and detect defects in electronic and 
electrical components. Thermographic testing involves the exertion of a thermal load on the target object. Changes in the thermodynamic properties of the component create sur-
face temperature profiles that can be measured with infrared imaging. Hot spots, due to component degeneration or poor internal contact , are quickly and easily identified. Th is 
is the adequate inspection method to detect defects that are close to the surface [41 ,42].  
Figure 11. Drone inspection [38].
5.3. Offshore Wind Turbines Inspection
Remote geographical locations and the positioning of critical parts of a WT, for exam-
ple, its nacelle and blades, make it unique and challenging for servicing and maintenance,
especially offshore sites for transporting wind farm technicians and other personnel by
Crew Transfer Vessels (CTVs). The environment inside the nacelle of the offshore WTs
is different from that of the onshore WTs. The ambient temperature inside the onshore
WT nacelle, operating, for example, in the Saharan climate, can be in a wide range from
 40C to +55C. This could be problematic when selecting the materials, for example,
when ﬁnding electronic equipment that can operate in such a range. The condition could be
worsened for the offshore WTs because of the need for an air-tight nacelle unit to minimize
the inﬂow of corrosive outer air and other corrosive marine elements (e.g., salt spray or
fog). This could lead to an increase in the internal temperature inside the nacelle, such
as in the generator part, which could go up to 150C when the cooling system is not
adequately installed. The remote location and position of offshore wind turbine structures
severely limits the application of in situ corrosion detection methods such as ultrasonic,
acoustic emission, and X-ray. This leads to the requirement of technology development for a
cost-effective end-to-end nondestructive testing (NDT) corrosion detection and monitoring
solution for offshore WTs. This can be achieved through the implementation of real-time
remote sensing (RTRS) technology utilizing electrochemical sensors, as there are limitations

with the use of in situ techniques, such as ultrasonic, acoustic emission, and X-ray with
regard to access for operators and the power source. The electrochemical sensors could
instead be used to remotely monitor the physical and electrochemical changes that take
place on the metallic materials [39].
6. Subsurface Inspection
There are several methods for inspecting subsurface blades. Some are applied at the
factory and others are applied to blades in operation. These are non-destructive testing NDT
methods that obtain information from the surface and inside the WTBs. These methods
include but are not limited to thermography, X-ray imaging, 3D laser inspection, and
ultrasonic testing [ 40]. Multi- and hyper-spectral cameras have also been used to detect
subsurface damage.
6.1. Thermography
Thermography is frequently applied to monitor and detect defects in electronic and
electrical components. Thermographic testing involves the exertion of a thermal load
on the target object. Changes in the thermodynamic properties of the component create
surface temperature proﬁles that can be measured with infrared imaging. Hot spots, due to
component degeneration or poor internal contact, are quickly and easily identiﬁed. This is
the adequate inspection method to detect defects that are close to the surface [41,42].
Pulsed thermography and pulsed phase thermography have been employed to evalu-
ate FRP wind turbine blades. Representative thermal images of the intended samples are
obtained in the transient phase of inspections (Figure 12). While the best detected results in
terms of the size of a defect are achieved at particularly short transient times, the highest
image contrast is obtained over rather long periods of time. Due to the relatively high
thermal conductivity of tested samples, testing is performed by a thermal conductivity
meter with a reasonably low maximum image frequency. PT and/or PPT may have lim-
ited detectability in some cases (i.e., impact damage, near-surface defects, and relatively
large defects).

6.2. X-ray Imaging  
This method is based on the difference in the absorption of X- ray photons passing 
through the part. The sensitivity of these systems is high enough to r eveal at least a 1 –2% 
change in material thickness or density. Backscatter X -ray imaging might be used to detect 
narrow delamination , where the gaps are less than 50 μm wide. When it comes to delam-
ination, the thinnest delamination  is found to be vague. The detectability of a defect relies 
on two main parameters. With such a reconstruction, most kinds of anomalies , such as 
voids, cracks, inclusions, dry fibers, and defective fiber alignment, even in small sizes, are 
simply detected and precisely positioned (Figure 13).

6.3. 3D Laser-Scanning Inspection
To speed up scanning and increase efﬁciency, ScanTech utilizes the HSCAN771 3D
scanner with seven red laser crosses (one additional red laser) to inspect large WTBs.
However, for blades larger than 6 m, errors accumulate during the 3D scanning, which
greatly reduces accuracy [40–43] (Figure 14).

However, for blades larger than 6 m, errors accumulate during the 3D scanning, which

Figure 14. 3D laser -scanning Inspection [42 ]. 
To comply with  the strict requirements of high accuracy,  the HSCAN771 3D scanner 
might be combined with the MSCAN photogrammetry system for processing. This com-
bination can increase the accuracy by 67% and significantly reduce the volumetric accu-
racy deviations. The full advantage s of such a combination can be expl oited to scan large 
parts. The scanning process is as follows [4 3]: 
Step 1: P lace reflective markers and coding points.  
Step 2: Use the photogrammetry system to capture the markers and coding points 
from different angles.  
Step 3: Scan the blade with the 3D  scanner and obtain 3D data.  
Step 4: Import the 3D data into the 3D software . 
Step 5: A djust and align the 3D model and the CAD model.  
Step 6: Modify the gaps and optimize the product development according to contrast 
detection.  
The MSCAN photogrammetry sy stem is commonly used  to measure large compo-
nents . Although this system can team up with the HSCAN 3D scanner to effectively re-
duce collective errors , it can be individually used for  the 3D inspection of large parts to 
measure part size, geometrical deform ation, etc (Figure 15).

6.4. Ultrasonic Technique  
To characteriz e material properties in the wind  turbine , blade  structure propagation 
features of ultrasound waves can be us ed. This technique is well- suited to detecting and 
identifying defects both on the surface and subsurface. C -scan imaging is an efficient tech-
nique , used to locate delamination or interfacial disbondment in composites. This inspec-
tion method has three diff erent techniques: pulse- echo, through- transmission, and pitch -
catch. However, the influence of superimposed reflections, scattering, and the attenuation 
of reflected ultrasound waves by the multilayer structure can be seen. The scattering effect 
creates some difficulties in the propagation of waves and lower frequencies are required 
[45–47]. The delay line between the transducer and object can be used if the thickness of 
the thin layers of the multilayer structure of the WTB needs to be measured. The schematic 
of the pulsed echo technique , along with a delay line , is shown in Figure 16. For the acous-
tic contact between the delay line and the surface of the test object, a coupling liquid, e.g.,  
low-viscosity oil, gel, or water can be used. Reflected sig nals from the internal interfaces 
or non- homogeneities of the component can be used to identify and, thereby, characterize 
the multilayered internal structure of the WTB. This technique is also recommended for 
use to control quality and estimate the level of adhesion between individual layers,  e.g., 
delamination between the front skin layer and the epoxy adhesive [48].

6.5. Hyper-Spectral Imaging Techniques
Hyper-spectral imaging belongs to the family of spectral imaging technologies, and
it is a promising candidate among the available wind-turbine blade-defect-recognition
solutions. Spectroscopy imaging has currently arisen as a scientiﬁc tool for detecting sur-
face and subsurface defects in structures with the growth in optical sensing and imaging
techniques. The hyper-spectral imaging technique combines modern imaging and spec-
troscopy to simultaneously obtain both spectral and spatial information from an object.
This technology showed great potential to detect ﬂaws, regardless of their types, from
the surface, subsurface, or even icing events. This remote in-ﬁeld inspection technology
provides high accuracy within a short inspection time. It can be a powerful tool used to
remotely monitor wind turbine blades from all types of damage. Figure 17a presents the
reﬂectance of the glass ﬁber sample. The reﬂectance achieves its lowest values at the delam-
ination location. The spikes shown in this ﬁgure can determine the location of these ﬂaws.
The detection probability of the presented delamination is illustrated in Figure 12b. The
detection probability varies depending on the abundance factor of delamination reﬂectance
and its size [49].

7. Using Sensors to Detect Wind Turbine Blade Defects  
Sensors installed on the blade or rotor shaft can be utilized as an inspectio n instru-
ment to detect defects in the operating WTBs. The collected data  can help to diagnose the 
presence of defects in the blade and plan repairs. The advantage of th is method is that the 
data can be visualized live and the emerging defect/failure can be  known in advance. The 
disadvantage of th is method is that the damaged areas cannot be precisely located and 
the sensors are exposed to environmental conditions, including an  extremely cold tem-
perature, icing, and lightning , and these sensors can also be d amaged in time or some-
times provide biased information due to icing phenomen a. 
These sensors include, among others , strain gauges and accelerometer. Strain gauges 
are used to measure deformations at specific locations, while accelerometers are used to meas ure the dynamic response and to perform modal analysis of a blade. However, there 
are some challenges in  the use of on-blade sensors, including:  
• Sensor installation during manufacturing or after commissioning;  
• Reliability of the sensors, which must be maintained for approximately 20 years;  
• Robustness of the communication, storage, processing, and data analysis systems.

7.1. Vibration Analysis
Vibration analysis is a viable technique to maintain consistent operation, particu-
larly for rotating equipment. The sensor type is fairly dependent on the frequency range
(0.01–100 kHz ): low-frequency range for position transducers, the medium frequency for
velocity sensors, high frequency for accelerometers, and very high frequency for emitted
spectral energy sensors. The physical condition of materials is monitored for the detection
and growth of cracks. Common methods are generally ofﬂine and are not appropriate
for online condition-monitoring. Exceptions can be made for the use of optical fuses in
blades and the acoustic monitoring of structures. Strain gauges could be an option for con-
dition monitoring, but are not sustainable for long-term monitoring. Strain measurements
could be beneﬁcial to predict the lifespan and stress level backup, especially for blades.
Fiber-optic sensors are promising in this regard, but still very expensive (Figure 18).
7.2. Acoustic Emission
The acoustic emission technique is suitable for the detection of the probable failure
of a blade in real-time or certiﬁcation tests. Elastic waves generated by rapid energy
release from localized sources in a multilayer structure of the blade are used to identify
damages (Figure 19) [ 41–45]. Acoustic monitoring is closely related to vibration monitoring.
However, vibration sensors must be rigidly mounted on an object to record the local motion,
and acoustic sensors are used to record the response of an object. They are attached by
a ﬂexible, low-attenuation adhesive. There are two acoustic monitoring techniques: the
passive type and the active type. In the passive type, the excitation is performed by the
component itself. In the active type, the excitation is applied by an external source [ 41].
When testing a ﬁberglass structure using acoustic emissions, the emission source is the
cracking of the matrix and ﬁbers. The dominant emission mechanism is determined by
the material characteristics and stress ﬁeld that are locally applied to each material region.
Recording acoustic emissions in a ﬁberglass structure that is subjected to external loading
signalizes a localized failure in the part. However, during initial loading or at low loads
relative to normal loading, the ﬁberglass structure generates acoustic emissions. In these
emissions, informative signals from internal cracks and non-homogeneities are present, but
this effect can be used to locate regions with high residual stresses. In a large ﬁberglass
structure, the optimal application of acoustic emission entails the spatial localization of the
acoustic emission sources. There are, however, problems with localizing an acoustic source
in a glass ﬁber with a complex structure, such as the high acoustic attenuation and phase
velocity dispersion.

be beneficial to predict the lifespan and stress level backup, especially for blades. Fiber -
optic sensors are promising in this regard, but still very ex pensive  (Figure 18) .

The acoustic emission technique is suitable for the  detection of  the probable failure 
of a blade in real -time or certification tests. Elastic waves generated by rapid energy re-
lease from localized sources in a multilayer structure of the blade are used to identify damages (Figure 19) [41 -45]. Acoustic monitoring is closely related to vibration monitor-
ing. However, vibration sensors m ust be rigidly mounted on an object to record the local 
motion, and acoustic sensors are  used  to record the response of an object. They are at-
tached by a flexible, low -attenuation adhesive. There are two acoustic monitoring  tech-
niques : the passive type and the active type. In the passive type, the excitation is per-
formed by the component itself. In the active type, the excitation is applied by  an external 
source [41]. When testing a fiberglass structure using acoustic emission s, the emission 
source is the c racking of the matrix and fibers. The dominant emission mechanism is de-
termined by the material characteristics and stress field that are locally applied  to each 
material region. Recording acoustic emission s in a fiberglass structure that is subjected to 
external loading signalizes a localized failure in the part. However, during initial loading or at low loads relative to normal loading, the fiberglass structure generates acoustic

 emissions. In these emissio ns, informative signals from internal cracks and non -homoge-
neities are present, but this effect can be used to locate regions with high residual stresses. 
In a large fiberglass structure, the optimal application of acoustic emission entails the spa-
tial loc alization of the acoustic emission sources. There are, however, problems with lo-
calizing an acoustic source in a glass fiber with a complex structure , such as the high 
acoustic attenuation and phase velocity dispersion.

9. Industry 4.0 for Wind-Power Industry
9.1. Sustainable Energy Production
The goal of sustainable energy development is to create resilient infrastructure and
promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, as well as foster innovation. Access
to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy requires a signiﬁcant increase in
the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix, as well as a doubling of the global
rate of energy-efﬁciency improvements. In this regard, energy production from wind farms
is the technology with the lowest cost of electricity production among renewable energy
sources. When operating a wind farm, it is important to avoid unplanned outages because,
in addition to the repair costs, operators lose revenue while the turbines are down.
Therefore, predictive maintenance should use extensive data to create a database
regarding the turbine and its environmental conditions to detect anomalies in operation
and early failures. In this way, the risk of failure can be reduced, and operations can be
efﬁcicently managed. Integrating condition monitoring systems (CMS) and new meth-
ods for data processing should be created by exploiting the beneﬁts of new technological
developments in the energy sector, as well as in the area of information and commu-
nication technologies. Industry 4.0 technologies can help to provide solutions for both
communications in wind turbines and networking in a wind farm.

9.2. Industry 4.0 Technologies
Industry 4.0 refers to cyber-physical technologies for the interconnectivity of tech-
nological developments to improve and optimize industries, businesses, and related pro-
cesses [ 48]. Industry 4.0 could contribute to ﬁnding new ways of dealing with some of
the major global challenges, such as climate change, food insecurity, lack of energy access,
and water scarcity. The revolutionized wind-energy industry requires the application of
Industry 4.0 technologies such as smart manufacturing, the internet of things (IoT), smart
inspection, and digital twins (DT). Dealing with data is the key to success in almost every
industry. Digitization projects, Industry 4.0 implementation, or artiﬁcial intelligence appli-
cations are all data-driven. The digital infrastructure for autonomous and highly dynamic
data value creation networks thrives only because of the participation and use of data.
9.3. Combining Industry 4.0 and Wind-Power Industry
Sustainable wind energy and Industry 4.0 share important characteristics that can be
interconnected to pursue digitalized wind-energy production. The wind-power industry
can be informed by a vision where the physical world of energy production merges with
the digital world of information technology; in other words, the creation of a digitized and
interconnected energy production system. Numerous opportunities, with high economic
and energy-saving potentials, are associated with digitalized and interconnected wind-
power energy.
One of the biggest challenges often expressed by companies related to Industry 4.0 is
data security. Standardized and secure data exchange for data value creation is the basis
for new cooperation and collaborative data-usage concepts. A less prominent challenge
is protecting and ensuring the privacy of employees, who also contribute a great deal of
personal information when constantly interacting with constantly connected devices. In
this context, the goal is to build virtual data rooms that are more efﬁcient, open, and ﬂexible
in their use of data, without neglecting data ownership and, at the same time, guaranteeing
data sovereignty. Virtual data spaces can be created for inter-company collaboration and
standardized data trading. The focus of this pre-commercial project is to develop a scalable
and secure architecture for such a data room using modern information and communication
technologies. Regulatory policies are useful to deﬁne contracts associated with the data.
These contracts are based on rules for usage-tracking, such as the duration of usage, data
sharing, etc. In addition, the purpose and cost of data use can be speciﬁed. For instance,
sensitive data can be made available for calculations with the certainty that it cannot be
read or used in any other way [52].
Digital twins are a virtual representation of a physical system that functions as a
real-time virtual model of the physical system. The digital twin tracks the whole life-cycle
of a wind turbine from manufacturing operation and maintenance. Digital twins consist
of three main components, the physical system, digital system, and networking platform,
which initiate communication between different elements of physical and digital systems.
A variety of enabling technologies should be implemented, as demonstrated in Figure 20,
to encompass the comprehensive elements required for DT. This DT model is particularly
suitable for health-condition monitoring of complex equipment in varied engineering
ﬁelds, e.g., in tunneling and underground space engineering, marine engineering, and
wind engineering [53].

 Fog computing  has been proposed  to support IoT devices. This kind of computing 
architecture focuses on processing as much as possible before sending it to the data center. 
As a result, it is possible to process extremely large datasets by offloading the heavy work 
from the central server to the fog nodes.

9.4. Architecture of Wind Turbine Digital Twins  
Digital twins’  software has been developed to make the most of the potential of dig-
itization and big data to improve efficiency and r educe costs. Digitization is implemented 
using sensors embedded in wind turbines, and an ever -increasing amount of data are  col-
lected for analysis to monitor the components ’ condition. Predictive maintenance and im-
proved wind farm design are just two of th e benefits that digitalization offers. Predictive 
maintenance , as a data- based service , is particularly relevant for wind -farm operators and 
their service providers. The object of this approach is to reduce unplanned downtime and 
optimize maintenance activ ities. The starting point is anomaly detection software , which 
is trained to recognize normal behavior in SCADA - and CMS -integrated data of a wind 
turbine using machine learning techniques based on a learning database. Situations with 
large deviations from  normal behavior can then be identified as potential fault patterns. 
The trained AI can evaluate the data of a wind turbine and infer the fault- causing compo-
nent through correction calculations. With more,  better -quality data to consider, th e AI 
delivers  better results . When analyzing possible input data , such as loading, vibration/fre-
quency a nd damage classification , different data sources (blades, nacelle, or foundations) 
need to be taken into consideration. In addition to the operating data of the wind t urbines, 
additional sensor technology often provides relevant information. External data, such as weather data, must also be taken into account. For example, wind turbine manufacturers could use simulation models to predict  the conditions of turbine and components, or pre-
dict service life based on detected anomalies [58].  
An architectural diagram of a digital twin for a wind turbine is presented in Figure

Figure 20. Variety of enabling DT technologies [53].
Since massive multisource heterogeneous data are generated during the operation
of a wind turbine, big data analytics technologies are required to collect, transmit, store
and process the data. DT services cope with the concrete functions depending on the
operation of the wind turbine. Extensive sensor technology is installed on the wind
turbines to control and monitor their operation. In offshore wind farms, several hundred
sensors continuously provide data on temperatures, pressures, speeds, accelerations, forces,
voltages, environmental conditions, and other physical data. The issue of real-time data-
processing and dealing with a large amount of available data may arise for digital twins
of wind turbines. The adoption of IoT offers the signiﬁcant beneﬁts of DT—the ability for
devices to communicate across a common platform. As connected machines can capture
and document signiﬁcant amounts of data, this allows for the opportunity to perform deep
analyses across multiple devices. Issues and trends can be quickly identiﬁed and managed
in a much more meaningful and efﬁcient manner. Digital twins of wind turbines can not
only follow the current condition, but also predict the future of their physical counterparts
and play an increasingly signiﬁcant role in proactive maintenance and prediction [ 54]. In
such a model, the simulated data obtained from numerical modeling and the sensor data
acquired from the wind turbine are continuously monitored, collected, and processed in
real-time to adapt to operational situations [ 55–57]. The processed data from all these
resources can be converted into the most effective and suitable operation-management and
energy-production instructions.
Fog computing has been proposed to support IoT devices. This kind of computing
architecture focuses on processing as much as possible before sending it to the data center.
As a result, it is possible to process extremely large datasets by ofﬂoading the heavy work
from the central server to the fog nodes.

Digital twins’ software has been developed to make the most of the potential of digiti-
zation and big data to improve efﬁciency and reduce costs. Digitization is implemented
using sensors embedded in wind turbines, and an ever-increasing amount of data are
collected for analysis to monitor the components’ condition. Predictive maintenance and

maintenance, as a data-based service, is particularly relevant for wind-farm operators and

is trained to recognize normal behavior in SCADA- and CMS-integrated data of a wind
turbine using machine learning techniques based on a learning database. Situations with
large deviations from normal behavior can then be identiﬁed as potential fault patterns. The
trained AI can evaluate the data of a wind turbine and infer the fault-causing component
through correction calculations. With more, better-quality data to consider, the AI delivers
better results. When analyzing possible input data, such as loading, vibration/frequency
and damage classiﬁcation, different data sources (blades, nacelle, or foundations) need to be
taken into consideration. In addition to the operating data of the wind turbines, additional
sensor technology often provides relevant information. External data, such as weather
data, must also be taken into account. For example, wind turbine manufacturers could use
simulation models to predict the conditions of turbine and components, or predict service
life based on detected anomalies [58].
An architectural diagram of a digital twin for a wind turbine is presented in Figure 19.
Using a bidirectional information ﬂow, the physical system communicates with the virtual
replica. SCADA system transmits sensor signals to the virtual system from the physical
system at the bottom. To ensure that the virtual replica accurately reﬂects the behavior of
the physical system; these signals are fed into the sub-models. Supervisory entities receive
insights from the virtual replica, which might be a human operator, a control engineer,
a designer, or an automated algorithm. For example, the structural loads of mechanical
components, control tracking errors, and operational parameters (temperatures, stresses,
and remaining useful life (RUL)) can be included in these insights. Regulatory bodies
can use these insights for decision-making regarding the physical system. For example,
updating a parameter, repairing, or replacing a component, or even triggering an emergency
brake. Multiple methods can be used to obtain insights from measurements or simulations.
Applying these techniques to the virtual replica offered here might result in a digital twin
for condition-monitoring and fault diagnosis. Realism is also inﬂuenced by the availability
of qualitative data, as well as accurate models.
Current wind turbines are well-equipped with multiple sensors, which are linked to
the SCADA system. The numerical power, rotor speed, and pitch curves can be superim-
posed with the data recorded by SCADA system [ 59]. Meteorological data are collected by
sensors on top of the nacelle. Wind speed and direction are measured with an anemometer
and a wind vane, respectively. A secondary wind-speed and wind-direction sensor are
generally included for both measurements. The LIDAR system, instead of the aforemen-
tioned sensors, can accurately determine wind speed. For example, LIDAR can provide a
preview of upcoming wind, which is valuable for controlling loads, yaw, etc. The nacelle
can also measure temperature and air pressure, in addition to wind speed and direction,
to approximate the air density. Moreover, turbine blades can be ﬁtted with accelerom-
eters, strain gauges, and micro-electromechanical (MEM) sensors to measure structural
loads and predict the behavior of ﬂexible blades. Blades can also be equipped with tem-
perature and humidity sensors to predict ice formation. Strain gauges, accelerometers,
and vibration sensors are installed on the main shaft of the turbine. A vibration sensor,
microphone, or eddy current sensor measures the thickness of the oil ﬁlm on the bear-
ings, as mentioned earlier. To monitor the stator winding temperature, the PMSG has a
position sensor on the shaft, e.g., an encoder or a resolver, and a resistive temperature
sensor Pt-100 or Pt-1000. Rogowski coils or current transformers can be used to monitor

temperature [60–63] (Figure 21).

10. Conclusions  
Wind turbine blade inspection is performed in two stages, during manufacturing and 
over operational lifespan on- site. During manufacturing, full surface and sub -surface in-
spections can be performed by almost all the non -destructive testing techniques. Seve ral 
techniques can be used f or in -service wind turbine inspections, depending on the circum-
stances , such as visual inspections, ultrasonic, shearography, thermography, and X -ray 
CT. The drone inspection method stands out as the safest solution for inspecti ng the 
blades of wind turbines  that are in service, as it can  be equipped with different kinds of 
sensors, cameras, and LIDAR , providing the opportunity t o merg e and aggregat e data 
from different sources using sensor -fusion techniques. Inspection by drone is a develop-
ing technology that generates large amounts of data from different resources. Using sen-
sor fusion techniques for smart inspection in the framework of the Industry 4.0 system accurately delivers insights regarding critical components of wind tur bine blades.  
At present , the methods of inspecting wind turbine blades are updated based on data 
organizing, processing, and analysis. Efforts have been made to reduce the human impact 
on inspection and adapt them to data science. D ata-based inspection ena bles predictive 
maintenance and , consequently , smart inspection. The c ollected data and simulation data  
provid e an opportunity to create wind turbines as digital twins. Artificial intelligence and 
machine learning techniques can be employed to simulate the  response of wind turbines 
for analysis by the digital twin in normal and extreme conditions. D igital twins can be 
virtually tested to analyze and evaluate wind turbines under extremely difficult opera-
tional conditions. The aspects of defect elimination and corrective measures related to 
each inspection method can be studied in future research works.
