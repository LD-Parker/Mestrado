 Abstract --- Renewable energy is viewed  as a vital energy field  
due to the present energy devastations. Among the vital 
substitutions being considered, wind energy is a strong 
challenger as a result of its reliability. “To yield wind energy 
more effectively, the structure of wind turbines has designed 
bigger, making p rotection and restoration works difficult. 
Because of different natural conditions, wind turbine blades are 
exposed to vibration and it prompts failure . If the failure  is not 
analyzed  initially , then it will haste dreadful destruction  of the 
turbine struct ure. To increase safety  perceptions, to decrease  
down time  and to cut down the repeat of unpredictable  
breakdowns, the wind turbine blades  must be examined  from time 
to time to guarantee that they are in great condition. In this 
paper, a three bladed wind turbine was preferred  and using  
vibration source  through statistical features , the state of a wind 
turbine blade  is inspected.  The fault classification is carried out 
using machine learning techniques like hyperpipes (HP) and 
voting feature intervals (VFI)  algorithm. The performance of 
these algorithms is compared  and better algorithm is suggested 
for fault prediction on wind turbine blades .”

I. INTRODUCTION  
Wind energy  has become  the most needed  resource in the 
present period  because of overall  environmental  pollute [1]. 
“Wind energy  is one of the proficient  renewable sources and 
option for normally  used sources. The wind turbine is used 
to change over wind energy  into electrical energy . To make 
wind energy  more important  assets of energy , performance , 
security , dependability, feasibility and  the life of turbines 
must be upgraded [2]. The wind makes the rotor post turn, in 
this way, making  the pole inside the wind turbine turn. The 
fragile , long and flexible, sharp  edge blades  are the part 
sticks  through the most incredibly  complex force and  it is 
easy to bring the vibration  on sharp edge  blades  [3]. The 
stressed  and dangerous  vibration will incite pulverization to 
the rotor edge and cause  damage . The blade  is one of the 
crucial parts with frequent damages . Because of its massive 
advancement and working condition, the vibration of the

damage identification  on wind turbine blades  is carried out  
using vibration source  and machine learning approach  [4].” 
Much  research and study were carried out on failure 
analysis of the blade . To name a few, Simulation of fatigue 
failure in a full composite wind turbine blade was studied by 
Mahmood M. Shokrieh, RohamRafiee [ 5]. “The lifetime 
prediction of a horizontal axis wind turbine composite blade 
is considered. Load cases are identified, calculated and 
evaluated. Static analysis is performed with a full 3 -D finite 
element method.  
They predicted 21 years approximately using ANSYS.  
Andrew Kusiak and Anoop  Verma [ 6] carried out work on a 
data-driven approach for monitoring blade pitch faults in 
wind turbines  using SCADA data.  They considered two 
blade pitch faults namely, blade angle asymmetry and blade 
angle implausibility and determine the associations between 
them.

health management with conti ngency control for wind 
turbines using nonlinear high -fidelity simulation. The 
structural health and contingency control of the blade was 
studied.  
The speed of the turbine and decision making using 
prognostic information was also carried out. Bindi Chen et.

prognosis using a -priori knowledge based adaptive neuro -
fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) using SCADA data and

 In their first step, the fault detection, is based on an 
alternative method based on the Gibbs sampling algorithm 
in which the occurrence of a sensor fault is modelled as a 
change point detection in a time series.  
On the second step, the fault isolation, is handled via 
Fuzzy/Bayesian network scheme classifying the kind of 
fault.  Optimal selection of auto regressive model 
coefficients for early damage detects ability with an 
application to wind turb ine blades was carried out by Hoe ll 
and Omenzetter [ 12].  
This study enhances the selection of auto regressive 
model coefficients for statistical hypothesis testing for 
damage presence and adding or eliminating the coefficients 
is carried out by genetic algorithm. ” 
Aero -structural design and optimization of a small wind 
turbine blade study was carried out by Pourrajabian  et. 
al[13]. “ 
They developed a methodology for aero -structural design, 
including consideration of the starting of a small wind 
turbine blade. They carried out both structural analysis and 
stress analysis on the blade by optimization.  Damir  et. al [14] 
has done a numerical model for robust shape optimization of 
wind turbine blades using 3D geometric modeler. They 
considered the blade design using simulation process, but 
they didn’t focus on the fa ults which affects the performance 
of the wind turbine. Numerous works were carried out using 
simulation analysis of fault and design analysis of wind 
turbine blade; however, only a very few in the experimental 
analysis was carried out  [15].  
The machine l earning technique was considered for wind 
turbine blade fault diagnosis; however, the usage was 
limited in the literature.  
A very limited set of defects was considered for analysis. 
This is especially true in the case of fault diagnosis of wind 
turbine bl ade.  
Hence, there is a strong need to design a fault diagnosis 
system which can handle multiple faults in wind turbine 
blades using machine learning approaches. This study 
makes a novel attempt to find different blade faults applying 
machine learning appr oach and statistical features. Figure 1 
shows the methodology of the work done. ” 
In this study for wind turbine blade fault diagnosis,  
 Faults like pitch angle twist, blade bends , erosion, 
hub-blade loose connection and crack are 
considered  
 Vibration signals are taken for the blade using data 
acquisition.  
 Statistical method is used for feature extraction  
 J48 algorithm is used for feature selection  
 Hyperpipes (HP) and voting feature intervals (VFI) 
algorithm  is used for feature classification  
 Better cl assifier is suggested for the real -time 
assessment   
Figure 1: Methodology  
II. EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES  
The main aim of this study is to classify whether the 
blades are in good condition or in a defective state. “If it is 
defective, then the objective is to identify the type of fault. 
The experimental setup and experimental procedure are 
described in the following subsec tions . 
2.1. Experimental Setup  
The experiment was carried out on a 50W, 12V variable 
speed wind turbine (MX -POWER, model: FP -50W -12V). 
The technical parameters of a wind turbine are given in 
Table 1. The wind turbine was mounted on a fixed steel 
stand in front of the open circuit wind t unnel outlet. The 
wind tunnel acts as a wind source to start the wind turbine. 
The wind speed was varied continuously in order to simulate 
the environmental wind condition. The experimental setup is 
shown in Figure 2. Piezoelectric type accelerometer was 
used as a transducer for acquiring vibration signals. It has 
high sensitivity for detecting faults. Hence, accelerometers 
are widely used in condition monitoring. In this case, an 
uniaxial accelerometer of 500g range, 100 mV/g sensitivity, 
and resonant freq uency around 40 Hz was used.

The piezoelectric accelerometer (DYTRAN 3055B1) was 
mounted on the nacelle near to the wind turbine hub to 
record the vibration signals using an adhesive mounting 
technique. It was connected to the DAQ system through a 
cable. The data acquisition system (DAQ) used was NI USB 
4432 model. The DAQ card has fiv e analogue input 
channels with a sampling rate of 102.4 -kilo samples per 
second with 24 -bit resolution. The accelerometer is coupled 
to a signal conditioning unit which consists of an inbuilt 
charge amplifier and an analogue -to-digital converter 
(ADC). Fro m the ADC, the vibration signal was taken. 
These vibration signals were used to extract features through 
feature extraction technique. One end of the cable is plugged 
to the accelerometer and the other end to the AIO port of 
DAQ system. NI – LabVIEW was us ed to interface the 
transducer signal and the system (PC).

2.2. Experimental procedure  
In the present study, three -blade variable horizontal axis 
wind turbine (HAWT) was used. Initially, the wind turbine 
was considered to be in good condition (free from defects, 
new setup) and the signals were recorded using an 
accelerometer. These signals were recorded with the 
following specifications.  1. Sample length: The sample length was chosen long 
enough to ensure data consistency; and al so the 
following points were considered. ARMA measures 
are more meaningful when the number of samples is 
sufficiently large. On the other hand, as the number 
of samples increases the computation time 
increases. To strike a balance, a sample length of 
10000  was chosen.  
2. Sampling Frequency:  The sampling frequency 
should be at least twice the highest frequency 
contained in the signal as per Nyquist sampling 
theorem. By using this theorem sampling frequency 
was calculated as 12 kHz (12000Hz).  
3. Number of samples:  Minimum of 100 (hundred) 
samples were taken for each condition of the wind 
turbine blade and the vibration signals were stored 
in data files.

 a) Blade bend (BB):  This fa ult occurs due to the high -
speed wind and complex forces caused by the wind. 
The blade was made to flap wise bend with 10 º 
angle.  
b) Blade crack (BC -2): This occurs due to foreign 
object damage on the blade while it is in operating 
condition. On the blade, 1 5mm crack was made.  c) Blade erosion (BE):  This fault is due to the erosion 
of the top layer of the blade by the high -speed wind. 
The smooth surface of the blade was eroded using 
emery sheet (320Cw) to provide an erosion effect on 
the blade.  
  
  
  
Figure 4: Vibration signal plot  
d) Hub-blade loose contact:  This fault generally 
occurs on a wind turbine blade due to an excessive 
runtime or usage time. The bolt connecting the hub 
and blade was made loose to obtain this fault.  
e) Blade pitch angle twist (PAT):  This fault occurs 
due to the stress on the blade caus ed by high -speed 
wind. This makes the pitch get twisted, creating a 
heavy vibration to the framework.  To attain this 
fault, blade pitch was twisted about 12º angle with 
respect to the normal blade condition.  In Figure 4, the vibration signals (sample numb er vs. 
amplitude) are shown which were taken for different 
conditions of the wind turbine blade (good condition blade, 
blade bend, blade erosion, hub -blade loose connection, 
blade crack and pitch angle twist).

 III. STATISTICAL METHOD FOR FEATURE 
EXTRACTION  
The vibration signals were obtained for good and other 
faulty conditions of the blades. If the time domain sampled 
signals are given directly as inputs to a classifier, then the 
number of samples should be constant. “The number of 
samples obtained are the function of rotation of the blade 
speed. Hence, it cannot be used directly as the input to the 
classifier. However, a few features must be extracted before  
the classification process. Descriptive statistical parameters 
[16] such as sum, mean, median, mode,  minimum, 
maximum, range, skewness, kurtosis, standard error, 
standard deviation and sample variance were computed to 
serve as features in the feature extraction process.  
 Sum: It is the sum of all feature values for each 
sample.  
 Mean: The arithmetic averag e of a set of values or 
distribution.  
 Median: Middle value sorting out the greater and 
lesser splits of a data set.  
 Mode: Most frequent value available in the data set.  
 Skewness: Skewness illustrates the degree of 
irregularity of a distribution around its mean. The 
following formula was used for calculation of 
skewness.  
           
                 
    
—(1) 
 Kurtosis: Kurtosis point toward the flatness or the 
spikiness of the signal. Its value is very low for 
normal condition of the blade and high for  the faulty 
condition of the blade due to the spiky nature of the 
signal and  ‘s’ is the sample standard deviation  
                 
                      
    
         
          —(2) 
 Standard error: Standard error is a measure of the 
amount of error in the prediction of y for an 
individual x in the regression, where x and y are the 
sample means and ‘n’ is the sample size.  
                   
   
                             
         —(3) 
 Minimum value: It refers to the least signal point 
value in a given signal.  
 Maximum value: It refers to the extreme signal 
point value in a given signal.  
 Range: Difference in extreme and least signal point 
values for a given signal.  
 Standard deviation: This is a measure of the actual 
energy or power content of t he vibration signal. The 
following formula was used for calculation of 
standard deviation.  
                                  
      —(4) 
 Sample variance: It is the variance of the signal 
points and the following formula was used for 
calculation of sample variance.  
                          
      —(5) 
When the statistical feature extraction was completed, the 
features were taken and the feature selection method was carried out. The statistical features form  the input t o the 
feature selection method. With the selected features, the 
further classification was carried out. ” 
IV. J48 DECISION TREE ALGORITHM FOR 
FEATURE SELECTION  
J48 decision tree algorithm is adapted from the C4.5 
algorithm in WEKA [17]. It consists of a number of 
branches, one root, a number of nodes, and a number of 
leaves. “One branch is a chain of nodes from the root to a 
leaf, and each node involves one attri bute. The occurrence 
of an attribute in a tree provides information about the 
importance of the associated attribute [18]. A decision tree 
is a tree based knowledge representation methodology used 
to represent classification rules. J48 decision tree algori thm 
is a widely used one to construct decision trees [19]. The 
procedure of forming the decision tree and exploiting the 
same for feature selection is characterized by the following:  
1. The set of features available at hand forms the input 
to the algorithm; t he output is the decision tree.  
2. The decision tree has leaf nodes, which represent 
class labels, and other nodes associated with the 
classes being classified.  
3. The branches of the tree represent each possible 
value of the feature node from which they origi nate.  
4. The decision tree can be used to classify feature 
vectors by starting at the root of the tree and moving 
through it until a leaf node, which provides a 
classification of the instance, is identified.  
5. At each decision node in the decision tree, one c an 
select the most useful feature for classification using 
appropriate estimation criteria. The criterion used to 
identify the best feature invokes the concepts of 
entropy reduction and information gain.  
Information gain measures how well a given attribute  
separates the training examples according to their target 
classification. The measure is used to select the candidate 
features at each step while growing the tree [20]. 
Information gain is the expected reduction in entropy  caused 
by portioning the samples  according to this feature.  
Information gain ( S, A) of a feature A relative to a collection 
of examples S, is defined as:  
           
                           
              —(6) 
where Value (A)  is the set of all possible values for 
attribute A, and Sv is the subset of S for which feature A has 
value v. Note the first term in the equation for gain is just 
the entropy of the original collection S and the second term 
is the expected value of the entropy after S is partitioned 
using feature A. The expected entropy described by the 
second term is simply the sum of the entropies of each 
subset Sv, weighted by the fraction of samples | Sv|/|S| that 
belong to Sv. Gain (S, A ) is, therefore, the expected 
reduction in entropy caused by knowing the value of feature 
A. Entropy is a measure of homogeneity of the set of 
examples and it is given by

where, c is the number  of classes, Pi is the proportion of  S 
belonging to class‘ i’.   
The J48 decision tree algorithm has been applied to the 
problem of feature selection. The input to the algorithm is 
the set of statistical features described above and output of 
the decision t ree shown in Figure 5. It is clearly shown that 
the top node is the best node for classification. The other 
features in the nodes of decision tree perform in descending 
order of significance. It is to be mentioned here that only 
features that contribute to  the classification appear in the 
decision tree and other features do not contribute much. The features which have the less discriminating capability can be 
consciously discarded by deciding on the threshold. This 
concept is made use for selecting good fea tures.  Figure 6 
shows the classification accuracy for number of features.  
The algorithm identifies the good features for the purpose of 
classification of the given training data set, and thus reduces 
the domain knowledge required to select good features for 
pattern classification problem [21]. Referring from Figure 5, 
one can i dentify the most dominating features to represent 
the blade conditions are the sum, range, standard deviation, 
and kurtosis. ”

 V. FEATURE CLASSIFICATION  
After the feature selection, the fault classification was 
carried out using hyperpipes (HP) and voting feature 
intervals (VFI) algorithms. “These both classifiers are called 
as miscellaneous Classifiers.  
Hyperpipes is an extremely simple classification 
algorithm that shares the double points of interest of being 
both quick in operation, and ready to effectively handle 
huge quantities  of features. The st andard hyperpipes 
algorithm can't deal with numeric class information [ 22].  
The essential thought is to make a solitary pipe for every 
class of the dataset. In training, the channel for every class 
monitors, which  trait values it has experienced, however,  no 
instructions of any sort are kept. At that point, to test every 
sample is classified by pipe that most contain  its abilities, 
which means the channel that most matches the specific 
occurrence's sample of abilities [ 23].  
Voting Feature Interval (VFI) is one of the most utilized 
machine learning approach [ 24]. The primary qualities of 
Voting Feature Interval are, it is faster, very precise, 
powerful too noisy training cases and has short training and 
classiﬁcation time. It depends on voting recurrence i ntervals. 
In voting Feature Interval, the class name  is allotted to every 
training sample  and is communicated as a vector of 
elements.  
The classiﬁcation of another sample depends on a voting 
among the classiﬁcation made by the estimations of every 
element  independently. Attribute intervals are then made for every component from the training illustrations. For every 
interval, a single value  and the votes of every class in that 
interval are maintained. In this manner, two nearby intervals 
denote to various c lasses. The class getting the most 
elevated vote is pronounced to be the expected class [ 25].” 
VI. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
The vibration signals were noted for good condition and 
faulty blade conditions using DAQ. “Totally 600 samples 
were collected; out of which 100 samples were from good 
condition blade. For different faults such as like blade 
bends , erosion, blade cracks , hub -blade loose connection, 
pitch angle twist, 100 samples from every condition were 
noted.  
 J48 decision tree algorithm was used to select the best 
contributing statistical features from twelve features which 
can have a say in discriminating fault conditions specific  
sum, mean, median, mode, minimum, maximum, range, 
skewness, kurtosis, standard e rror, standard deviation and 
sample variance.  
 From Figure 5 and 6, the selected features are given as 
the input to the classifier to determine the classification 
accuracy with respect to faults created on the wind turbine 
blade. From Figure 7, voting feat ure intervals (VFI) 
algorithms give the maximum classification accuracy of 
75.13% when compared tohyperpipes (HP) algorithms 
(70%).  
 
Figure 7: Overall classification accuracy of the classifiers  
The strength of bias towards more confident feature  
varied  from 0.1 to 20 in voting feature intervals (VFI) 
algorithms to provide a maximum accuracy with low 
misclassification errors  [26]. For bias 9, the classification 
accuracy of VFI was found to be 77.67%.  Figure 8 shows the result of bias which is varied for voting feature intervals 
(VFI) algorithms.  The confusion matrix of the voting feature  
intervals (VFI) algorithms is shown in Table 2. In confusion 
matrix, the diagonal element represents the cor rectly 
classified instance and the others are misclassified  [27].

 From 600 samples, 466 samples are correctly classified 
(77.67%) and remaining 134 are misclassified (22.33%). 
From confusion matrix (Table 2), the good signal shows 16 
faulty signals are classified as loose condition  [28]. This 
does not have much impact when compare with the loose condition being classified as good signals (20 signals). The 
time taken to build the model is about 0.78 seconds; hence, 
this can use in real time for the fault detection on the wind 
turbine blade. The detailed classwise accuracy is shown in 
Table 3. ”

The kappa statistics were found to be 0. 732. It is used to 
measure the arrangement of likelihood with the true class.  
“The mean absolute error was found to be 0. 1939 . It is a 
measure used to measure how close forecasts or prediction are with the ultimate result. The root mean square error was 
found to be 0. 2994 . It is a quadratic scoring rule which 
processes the average size of the error  [29].

 The true positive (TP) rate should be close to 1 and the 
false positive (FP) rate should be close to 0 to propose the 
classifier is a better classifier for the problem classification. 
TP and FP are very important in the classification process. 
In the votin g feature intervals (VFI)  algorithms, it shows 
that the TP near to 1 and FP close to 0, then one can predict 
that the classifier we build for the particular problem is very 
much effective for the fault diagnosis problem  [30]. The 
classifier error chart is shown in Figure 9. Here the squared  
dots represent the misclassification and the ‘x’ denotes the 
correct  classification. ” 
VII. CONCLUSION  
The wind turbine is very important in the production of 
wind energy in day to day life. “This paper presents an 
algorithmic  based clarification of vibration signals for the 
assessment of wind turbine blade conditions. From the 
acquired vibration data, two modelswere developed  using 
data modelling technique. Hyperpipes (HP) and voting 
feature intervals (VFI) algorithms was used to learn and 
classify the different conditions of the blade. These models  
are tested under 10 -fold cross validation and maximum 
correctly classified instances were found  to be 77.67 % for 
voting feature intervals (VFI) algorithm . The erro r rate is 
relatively less and may be considered for the blade fault 
diagnosis. Hence, voting feature intervals (VFI) algorithm 
can be practically used for the condition monitoring of wind 
turbine blade to reduce the downtime and to provide more 
wind energy . The methodology and algorithm suggested in 
this paper can be potentially used for any kind of wind 
turbine blade to diagnose the blade fault with minimal 
modification. ”
