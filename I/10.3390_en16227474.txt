Abstract: Acoustic emission (AE) is one of the methods of non-destructive evaluation (NDE), and
functions by means of detecting elastic waves caused by dynamic movements in AE sources, such as
cracking in various material structures. In the case of offshore wind turbines, the most vulnerable
components are their blades. Therefore, the authors proposed a method using AE to diagnose wind
turbine blades. In the identiÔ¨Åcation of their condition during monitoring, it was noted that the
changes characterising blade damage involve non-linear phenomena; hence, wave phenomena do
not occur in the principal components of the amplitudes or their harmonics. When the authors used
the inverse transformation in the signal analysis process, which essentially leads to Ô¨Ånding a signal
measure, it allowed them to distinguish the wave spectrum of an undamaged system from one in
which the material structure of the blade was damaged. The characteristic frequencies of individual
phenomena interacting with the blade of a working turbine provide the basis for the introduction
of Ô¨Ålters (or narrowband sensors) that will increase the quality of the diagnosis itself. Considering
the above, the use of the coherence function was proposed as an important measure of a diagnostic
signal, reÔ¨Çecting a given condition of the blade.
Keywords: wind turbine; blades of wind turbine; acoustic emission; blade failures; diagnostic of
wind turbine
1. Introduction
Causes of damage to rotating components include long-term exposure to a load,
i.e., fatigue wear of the material, but also tribological wear, and the formation of position
errors, such as misalignment of the mating mechanisms. As for blades, there are additional
factors caused by collisions with objects and lightning strikes. Offshore wind turbines are
additionally affected by the aggressive marine environment, as well as the irregularity of
the wind impacts and resonances generated by wave action.
According to Carrol et al. [ 1,2], the average failure rate of an offshore wind turbine is
8.3 failures per turbine per year. That includes 6.2 minor repairs (costs below EUR 1000),
1.1 major repairs (EUR 103‚Äì104), 0.43 major replacements, and 0.7 failures where no cost
data can be categorized. The blades are the Ô¨Åfth biggest contributor to overall failure, with
6.2% (after the pitch and hydraulic system, auxiliary components, generator, and gearbox).
Analysing the most frequent failures of wind turbines, it can be concluded that four
main components of a wind turbine account for almost 70% of all of the failures that are
signiÔ¨Åcant from an operational point of view (Table 1). At the same time, failures generate
downtime, signiÔ¨Åcantly affecting the associated operating costs [3].

References [ 1,2,4] provide a basis for demonstrating that wind turbine blades are
the most vulnerable components, next to the gearbox and the generator. For onshore
turbines, the complete replacement of a damaged blade with a new one can cost up to USD
200,000 [ 4]. The use of a crane involves an additional cost of approximately USD 350,000
per week [ 4]. The costs associated with repairing or replacing offshore turbine blades are
many times higher. Additionally, offshore wind turbines require more complicated and
more expensive service to assess the condition or possible repair of the blades.
When analysing the possible means to solve this problem, a review of related publica-
tions was carried out. In addition, future trends and challenges related to structural health
monitoring systems in wind turbine blades were analysed. For example, Fausto Pedro,
Garc√≠a M√°rquez et al., in their paper [ 5], overviewed the most important and up-to-date
(according to the authors) condition-monitoring techniques based on non-destructive test-
ing applied to wind turbine blades. Next, reference [ 6] overviews methods related to the
investigation of turbine blades by means of vibration measurements, deformation, acoustic
emission signals, ultrasonic methods, or thermography. Another study [ 7] presents an
interesting approach to the recognition of external features of blade damage, based, among
others, on a statistical method using object detection with Haar features or the AdaBoost
algorithm. The importance of the problem related to repairs and the early detection of
blade damage is addressed in [ 4]. It states that relatively minor damage in the form of
surface erosion contributes to unplanned repairs or turbine downtime‚Äîseveral times more
often than, say, damage to the structure itself. Downtime can be reduced when turbines are
periodically diagnosed. Dhanraj and Sugumaran [ 8] proposed a method based on pattern
recognition, which consists of three phases, namely feature extraction, feature selection,
and feature classiÔ¨Åcation. They presented statistical features that were extracted from
vibration signals; feature selection was performed using a decision tree algorithm and
feature classiÔ¨Åcation was performed using a random tree algorithm. These authors propose
the use of acoustic emission signals and coherence functions as a method for diagnosing
wind turbine blade failures. The diagnostics of a wind turbine blade require inducing
a comparable force (or more precisely, stress), generating the formation of elastic waves.
Kaewniam et al., in their article [ 9], provided an overview based on Ô¨Åve research areas:
signal response, features, sensors, NDT techniques, and testing methods. The research was
concerned with the testing of wind turbine blades (WTBs), which are the main components
of wind turbines but at the same time are susceptible to different types of damage due to
various environmental effects, fatigue loads, etc. Summarizing the studies in the literature
review, acoustic emission as a phenomenon is used by many researchers who propose
the use and comparison of source signals or classical methods using energy meters or AE
events, but a separate descriptor proposed by the authors of this article, the coherence
function, has not been used to diagnose blades so far. The method proposed by the authors
of this article is included in the chapters Assumptions of the Proposed Diagnostic Method
and Results.
Most modern wind turbine blades are made of Ô¨Åbreglass reinforced with polyester or
epoxy resin, or polymers reinforced with glass, carbon, aramid, and basalt Ô¨Åbres. Carbon
or Kevlar Ô¨Åbre is also used as reinforcement (but this solution is very expensive, especially
for larger blades). Designing a blade is an extremely complex task (Figure 1). The blade
must have the following characteristics [10]:
 SufÔ¨Åcient rigidity (so that blades do not collide with the tower in stronger gusts);
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2023 ,16, 7474 3 of 17
 Low mass, durability (it should last the entire life cycle of the power plant and, there-
fore, a minimum of 0 years for onshore power plants and 30 years for offshor e turbines );
 Low noise generation (the blade tip shape is vital, as it moves fastest);
 Resistance to soiling and icing (the blades are designed to withstand any additional
weight resulting from these factors or an anti-icing system is added);
 Shape to ensure adequate aerodynamic properties;
 Resistance to lightning.
The authors‚Äô analysis, included in the chapter Downtime Case Analysis of Wind
Turbines Installed in Poland, also showed that the current time is particularly important
due to the fact that many wind turbines have been installed in Europe and have been
operating for a long time, so it has become important to determine the conditions of the
blades, which may be subject to microcracks or other forms of damage.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Downtime Case Analysis of Wind Turbines Installed in Poland
To conÔ¨Årm the signiÔ¨Åcance of the wind turbine blade damage problem, the authors
have analysed 38 wind turbines installed in Poland. The examined turbines were of the
same type, made by the same manufacturer, and in their 3rd and 4th year of operation.
Downtime periods and associated causes were analysed (Table 2). In addition to turbine
outages related to damage, those caused by, for example, scheduled periodic maintenance
and warranty repairs, but also indirect external factors inÔ¨Çuencing the outage of the turbine,
such as the electricity consumption network, were also included. It is shown here that,
despite the relatively short service life of the turbines, blades are still a signiÔ¨Åcant and
important component associated with turbine damage.
Table 2. The most frequent causes of downtime of wind turbines in Poland in third and fourth year
of their operation in [h].
Unit Downtime [h] Percentage of Damage
Warranty repairs and periodic inspections 1647,03 25%
Grid 1440,10 22%
Yaw system 1221,70 18%
Blades 912,09 14%
Generator 787,99 12%
Gearbox 486,18 7%
Air brake 94,03 1%
Hydraulic systems 72,72 1%
Notably, the largest number of downtime hours was due to repairs and warranty
inspections, as well as periodic inspections required by Polish law (mainly equipment
under the supervision of the OfÔ¨Åce of Technical Inspection) and power grid failures. These
factors account for as much as 45% of downtime in the operation of the wind farm under
study. From the point of view of the wind farm/plant owner, grid failures are the most
problematic, as they shut down the entire wind park. Elimination of such failures is beyond
control of the maintenance team. From the point of view of the wind turbine operator, these
are failures/shutdowns that are not even remotely predictable. Other troublesome units
are the nacelle yaw system and turbine blades.
The top six failures ranking in Table 2, account for 53% of wind turbine downtime.
Therefore, the authors proposed an analysis of one of the most important components in
terms of service-cost intensity, i.e., turbine blades.
Despite the installation of a lightning protection system in newer wind power plants,
lightning-related phenomena cannot be ruled out. When lightning hits an unprotected
blade which does not contain any metallic, conducting parts, it can discharge in one of
three locations. Energy dissipation can occur on the outside blade surface or in the inner
structure of the blade laminations. Lightning hitting the windmill blade usually creates a

type of damage that can be described as stitching. This phenomenon is well known and
some visual inspection can identify the problem, but there is no chance to help such a
situation without a proper protective system. This can cause damage to turbine blades
(blade tips are particularly vulnerable here).
An additional blade-related problem is servicing measurements related to the ‚Äúquality‚Äù
of the lightning protection system. Service technicians face the practical difÔ¨Åculty of
assessing the lightning protection system or fully identifying the technical condition of the
lightning protection system. There are no unambiguous and simple methods by which a
service technician carrying out a periodic inspection can assess the condition of lightning
conductors. In addition, the authors stated in a previous publication [ 11] that lightning
can be one of the causes of stray currents, which in turn can be a major cause of damage
to one of the most expensive components in terms of replacement costs, namely turbine
gearboxes. As indicated before, lightning might be a cause of signiÔ¨Åcant damage to rotor
blades, despite appropriate safeguards.

An analysis of the literature [4,6 ] confirms that the typical yet most common of  
turbine blades presented in Figure 2 are caused by : 
‚àí Lightning strike;  
‚àí Erosion of the trailing edge (in most cases)  [13,14] ; 
‚àí Damage caused by microcracks and fatigue  [13,14 ]; 
‚àí Icing (particularly significant in certain areas of turbine installation).  
Individual damage failures are often dependent on each other. For instance, damage 
caused by microcracks can occur due to icing of the turbine blade. The s plitting action of 
ice particles, in fact, causes delamination and subsequent cracking of the surface layer. In reference [15], an algorithm for diagnosing wind turbine  blade icing using hybrid features 
and the Stacked -XGBoost algorithm was proposed .

the blade bearings (also called angular contact/ pitch bearings), which are responsible
for rotating the blade at the desired angles in order to optimize electricity production.

condition monitoring along with machine learning tools has itself undergone many de-
velopments and improvements over the decades. However, an analysis [ 7] has shown
that there is no standardized, certiÔ¨Åed, and accredited method of using a non-invasive

measurement technique to detect spots of potential damage in wind turbine blades. The use
of non-invasive methods in the wind power industry is primarily based on the wind turbine
operators‚Äô own guidelines. The initial method of non-invasive damage detection was visual
inspection and measurement by technical personnel. Typically, the sensitivity threshold
here is quite low: damage is generally only seen (or heard) when it is at an advanced
stage of development. The elastic waves of acoustic emission for machine and system
diagnostics are used in the broadest sense [ 3,11,18]. Thus, the use of wave relationships, or
putting it more precisely, disturbances of the propagating elastic waves, was proposed and
preliminarily tested for diagnosing wind turbine blade damage.
Acoustic emission, by deÔ¨Ånition, is the phenomenon of spontaneous or stress-induced
elastic wave generation acting through plastic deformation, crack propagation, corrosion,
collision, erosion, or leakage. It belongs to the group of passive methods, i.e., the AE device
does not emit signals and does not affect the physical state of the object under test, but only
records the physical effects that arise spontaneously in the monitored object. The sources
of the acoustic emission elastic wave signal are, therefore, the formation and propagation
of micro-cracks, corrosion processes, and material cracking in prestressed structures, but
also internal material displacements. The elastic waves generated in the source propagate
from the source in all directions in the volume of the object to be monitored. The elastic
waves reach the sensor AE and are then transmitted to the analyser in the form of electrical
voltage changes. The measuring apparatus consists of an AE sensor that converts the signal
into a varying electrical voltage, an analyser that ampliÔ¨Åes this voltage and eliminates
signals not originating from the monitored source (acoustic background), and a device that
records the AE wave signal. The acoustic emission frequency ranges from a fraction of a
hertz to the order of a megahertz. Wang et al. [ 19] described methods for diagnosing wind
turbine blades using acoustic emissions. The results indicated that the best method for the
detection of defect source growth caused by fatigue damage was using the triangle method
to analyse the relative arrival time of the wave to the sensor with determination of the
location of the defect growth. Another approach to acoustical damage detection of the WTB
is presented by Chen et al. [ 20], who applied the improved incremental support vector data
description (SVDD) model. The physical method in combination with the Ô¨Ålter and sliding
window is able to detect sound pulses of the WTB from among strong background noise.
The issue of using EA in the diagnosis of WTBs is most comprehensively described by Liu
in reference [ 21], while the list of strengths and weaknesses of the main methods based on
acoustic emission testing in WTB was formulated by Marquez and Chacon [5].
2.2. Assumptions of the Proposed Diagnostic Method
The method proposed by the authors of this article consists of placing a ‚Äòline‚Äô of
interconnected acoustic emission sensors, triggering a measurement when a certain wind
force is exceeded. An additional sensor (trigger) is connected to a stress sensor whose
output signal depends on the force applied to the turbine blade and which, after obtaining
the appropriate tension in the blade, starts the AE wave measurement process. This
ensures the measurement repeatability of the tested and obtained signals. In this way, the
signal triggers an acoustic emission measurement (Figure 4). This arrangement ensures
reproducible (comparable) conditions of the recorded elastic wave and allows for accurate
comparison (using the coherence function) of individual ‚Äúsections‚Äù of the blade of the
diagnosed turbine. This makes it possible to precisely determine the place (location) of
damage or discontinuity in the material. In tests using elastic acoustic emission waves, most
measuring instruments have the possibility to set a so-called threshold value for the signal.
In this case, the threshold value would be adjusted (set by the service technician) depending
on where the turbine is installed‚Äîonshore or offshore, but could also be dependent on
the probability of damage, e.g., depending on the operating time of the blades. The
waveform recorded by such sensors at speciÔ¨Åed intervals is compared and analysed using
a consistency function. Wind energy, by deÔ¨Ånition, is the energy content of air Ô¨Çow due

Figure 4. Scheme of design of the proposed diagnostic method targeting wind turbine blade damage.  
A power curve is made for each turbine, for which the output power is shown as a 
function of wind speed, where the rated (optimum) wind speed is highlighted. In the case 
of the scheme described in th is article, the rated value is assumed (for the turbine under 
consideration), thus ensuring a constant and , therefore,  repeatable internal tension of the 
turbine blade. In the simplest case, it is proposed to use a strain gauge sensor, which, when 
a specific blade stress value is exceeded, triggers the measureme nt of acoustic emission 
wave signals. In any case, it is possible to move the threshold of the stress value, which 
can depend on the design of a particular blade. Acoustic emission is generated by the 
corresponding state of stress acting on the internal st ructure. Disturbance of the signal 
changes the extracted dynamic system similarly to the application of modal analysis. By comparing the different ranges of emitted characteristic frequencies, we are able, using the coherence function, to determine the typ e of wave disturbance, and,  thus , the type of 
damage to the structure.  
The number of acoustic emission sensors installed depends on the length of the wind 
turbine blade. In the future, as technology develops, it may be possible to use a system of 
acoustic emission sensors installed every few tens of centimeters in a suitable composite

The acoustic emission signal, in the form of an elastic wave, was generated by means
of a repetitive pulse generated on the surface of the blade. Figure 7 shows the source
signal‚Äîthe pulse generated in an intact part. A clear difference in the time signal was
recorded for an identical excitation in a blade with a defective leading edge (Figure 8).

In the simplest interpretation, RMS (as a me asure of the periodically changing volt-
age signal generated at the AE sensor) determ ines the energy parameters of a signal. In 
the experiment, for the signal from the dama ged part of the blade, the RMS value was 
2469, while, for the same pulse in the part without defects, the RMS value was 2764. This 
difference can be explained in a relatively simp le way. In the blade under test, at the point 
of damage to the leading edge, there is a change in the elastic characteristics, part of the 
energy of the wave reaching the sensor is scattered and reflected. The arriving AE source 
wave in the damaged area will, therefore, be  disturbed and scattered and, consequently, 
its RMS value will decrease. 
In order to determine the type of damage (for the application of online diagnosis) in 
an operating turbine, a more sophisticated method of signal analysis is, therefore, pro-
posed. From a theoretical point of view, co mponents made of high-strength composites 
tend to have strongly non-linear dynamic char acteristics and their material constants e.g., 
equivalent Young‚Äôs modulus, are dependent on the magnitude and rate of the strain in a 
different manner than in commonly used rheological models (Voigt model) [25]: 
ùê∏‡Øî‡Øü‡Øß=ùëì(ùë•, ùë•·à∂) ùëì=? (3)
where ùê∏‡Øî‡Øü‡Øß defines some replacement energy value; f(x) is a function of the solution vector 
of the system of differential equations (assuming that these equations exist). In the given 
equation, it is a non-linear  function of the variable  concerning displacements x and veloc-
ity ·∫ã. 
If we assume that a system such as a wind  turbine blade can be described by a math-
ematical function, even slight damage to the structure will change the elastic characteris-
tics of this system. Consequently, there may be a change in the non-linear part of this 
characteristic for at least one generalised coor dinate. Even if the damage does not generate 
any external symptoms (because only an internal crack will occur), there should be a 
change in the elastic characteristics of the syst em under test. In the course of this research, 
the authors‚Äô basic guideline was to look for a measure of the signal propagating through 
the turbine blade structure, wh ich would be defined on the non-linear part of the spec-
trum. Particularly in the case of an offshore po wer plant, it is possible to determine (find) 
stable (for comparable reference conditions) blade stresses under the influence of the act-
ing wind.

signal generated at the AE sensor) determines the energy parameters of a signal. In the

wave in the damaged area will, therefore, be disturbed and scattered and, consequently, its
RMS value will decrease.
In order to determine the type of damage (for the application of online diagnosis)
in an operating turbine, a more sophisticated method of signal analysis is, therefore,
proposed. From a theoretical point of view, components made of high-strength composites
tend to have strongly non-linear dynamic characteristics and their material constants e.g.,

different manner than in commonly used rheological models (Voigt model) [25]:

where EaltdeÔ¨Ånes some replacement energy value; f(x) is a function of the solution vec-
tor of the system of differential equations (assuming that these equations exist). In the
given equation, it is a non-linear function of the variable concerning displacements xand
velocity.x.
If we assume that a system such as a wind turbine blade can be described by a mathe-
matical function, even slight damage to the structure will change the elastic characteristics
of this system. Consequently, there may be a change in the non-linear part of this charac-
teristic for at least one generalised coordinate. Even if the damage does not generate any
external symptoms (because only an internal crack will occur), there should be a change
in the elastic characteristics of the system under test. In the course of this research, the
authors‚Äô basic guideline was to look for a measure of the signal propagating through the
turbine blade structure, which would be deÔ¨Åned on the non-linear part of the spectrum.
Particularly in the case of an offshore power plant, it is possible to determine (Ô¨Ånd) stable
(for comparable reference conditions) blade stresses under the inÔ¨Çuence of the acting wind.
The coherence function deÔ¨Ånes a linear relationship between two signals, a(t) and
b(t), for a given frequency. Thus, it determines the degree of relationship between two
signals by means of a linear function. The ordinary coherence function speciÔ¨Åed as part of
the output signal is shaped by a linear transformation of the input signal. The coherence
function is used to verify whether a linear relationship between two waveforms applies in
a particular case. High coherence for a given frequency indicates that the two signals for
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2023 ,16, 7474 11 of 17
that frequency have a high power concentration. The two functions are only equal to each
other for an undistorted linear system. In any other case, the coherence function is less
than unity. This function between two continuous waveforms, a(t) and b(t), is expressed by
the equation [25]:
gab(w)=jSab(w)jp
Sa(w)Sb(w)(4)
where Sa(w)is a power spectrum of the signal a(t),Sb(w)is a power spectrum of the signal
b(t), and Sab(w)is a spectrum of the reciprocal power of the signals a(t) and b(t).
A high coherence for a given frequency indicates that the two signals for that frequency
have a high power concentration. The coherence varies between 0 and 1. If ab(w) is
equal to 0 for all frequencies, it means that the functions a(t) and b(t) are uncorrelated
for all frequencies. If gab(w) is equal to 1 for all frequencies, the functions are fully
correlated [ 25,26]. Coherence is proportional to the ratio of the level of the useful signal
to the sum of the levels of the useful signal and the interfering signal (interference, wave
dispersion). In other words, coherence is an indicator of the ratio of the useful signal to
the noise (or more precisely to the total signal, i.e., useful signal plus noise), as a function
of frequency. It can be assumed that coherence informs us about the ‚Äòquality‚Äô of the
useful signal, i.e., the level of interference from unwanted signals. Unwanted or otherwise
destructive interference results in the extinction or weakening of the useful signal.
In a classical frequency analysis, using the coherence function, we can isolate distur-
bances at the input or output of a system in a relatively simple way, provided that we
know beforehand which type of disturbance is present. The problem, however, is how
to interpret low values of the coherence function when the system is non-linear. If the
coherence function is greater than zero but less than unity, it follows that:
  The system binding the signals together is non-linear;
  There are other unknown signals at the input of the system besides the observed
input signal.
The appearance of a ‚Äònew fault‚Äô signal violates the coherence of the previous ones,
which causes the coherence function to decrease.
3. Results
In the practical search for a diagnostic symptom, it is possible to Ô¨Ånd a measure
indicating that some damage exists on the basis of a comparative analysis of the elastic
waves of acoustic emission for a blade with and without damage. Analyzing the studied
characteristics of the waveforms presented in Figures 7 and 8, using the coherence function,
three clearly distinguished zones can be noticed in the obtained spectrum of the elastic
wave signal of acoustic emission (Figure 9). The Ô¨Årst one concerns the lowest harmonics,
which can be described by continuous linear equations. In this zone, the inÔ¨Çuence of the
wind force acting on the blade is signiÔ¨Åcant. The second one is the zone of non-linear
interactions associated with the turbulence of the turbine column and the vibrations of
the blade itself, and the third zone relates mainly to surface, longitudinal, and transverse
waves. The impacts in the non-linear zones are repeatable for speciÔ¨Åc boundary conditions
and should be sensitive to different types of structural disturbance. They will, therefore, be
related to the measurable value of the wave and wind impact cycle. If we deÔ¨Åne the wave
signal for an undamaged blade as Ymand the signal with the looked for damage as Yn, the
search for the difference can be written as [25]:
Y(w,Qm)=√•Pk(w)Hk(qi,zi)+F(Qm)+Y (5)
Y(w,Qn)=√•Pk(w)Hk(qi,zi)+F(Qn)+Y (6)
where F‚Äîfunction vector identifying the initial state of the system, P(w) is an excitation
spectrum or power spectral density, His the spectral transmittance, and Yis a measurement
of the noise.
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2023 ,16, 7474 12 of 17
Hence, the difference in the two signals is [25]:
DmnY(!)= F(Qm)+F(qi,Qn)+Y=DF(qi,Qm,Qn,Y) (7)
Therefore [25]:
qi=

where qiis the damage parameter, and X represents the combined transformations of the
output and input signals.
However, it becomes important to determine the inverse transformation ( DF) 1which,
in fact, leads to the Ô¨Ånding of a signal measure (descriptor) that allows the wave spectra of
a system to be distinguished: for one without damage and for one in which a structural
disturbance has occurred.

In the band for 25‚Äì45 kHz, the inÔ¨Çuence of blade faults can be observed. This type of
spectrum in the indicated frequency band results from the formation of additional signal
sources associated with wave reÔ¨Çections. The fault (material discontinuity) generates a
component of acoustic emission energy that is visible as wavelet coefÔ¨Åcients (which are a
function of scale and position) with an extended duration. This is mainly due to internal
reÔ¨Çections of the elastic wave, which generates additional (visible in the Ô¨Ågure) frequency
bands of the AE signal.

4. Conclusions
Damage to wind turbine blades signiÔ¨Åcantly contributes to downtime of the entire
power plant. The acoustic emission signal in the blade, loaded with wind force, is examined,
which in turn is perceived as the surface, longitudinal, and transverse components of the
wave. Research shows that, in selected frequency bands (usually at high or very high
frequencies‚Äîabove 25 kHz), the coherence function is sensitive to even minor damage
to the blade surface structure. The entire band associated with severe blade damage
occurs in the 25‚Äì45 kHz range. It is shown that there is a clear spectral characteristic of
the damaged blade, and the coherence function of the tested blade clearly indicates the
existence of three distinct bands. The Ô¨Årst band concerns the lowest harmonics (i.e., related
to the transmission of low-frequency vibrations, e.g., through a wind turbine tower or the
failure of gears or other devices in the nacelle), the second band is the zone of non-linear
interactions (related, among others, to the non-stationarity of wave or wind action), and
the third band is associated with the clearly visible elastic wave spectrum in the acoustic
emission associated with the blade failure.
These characteristic frequencies of individual phenomena interacting with the blade of
a working turbine provide the basis for the introduction of Ô¨Ålters (or narrowband sensors)
that will increase the quality of the diagnosis itself. Further research by the authors leading
to determining the type of damage will consist of narrowing down and detecting frequency
bands that are characteristic of various (speciÔ¨Åc) discontinuities. Although the method has
been veriÔ¨Åed for a speciÔ¨Åc type of damage to the leading edge, development of the analysis
will allow for the precise extraction and identiÔ¨Åcation of the frequencies responsible for
the comprehensive and detailed identiÔ¨Åcation of a given type of damage in the veriÔ¨Åed
and described characteristic band. Moreover, the proposed diagnostic method, in addition
to identifying blade damage in the form of ‚Äúwith or without defects‚Äù, allows for Ô¨Ånding
the frequencies responsible for the operation of devices installed in the nacelle. This, in
turn, generates a process of accurate diagnosis (separating overlapping phenomena) using
known methods, e.g., vibration, or possibly stopping the turbine when it is determined
that the permissible values have been exceeded.
The above conclusions indicate that the proposed coherence function is capable of
being suitable for the requirement of the online crack detection of WTBs in the Ô¨Åeld with
instant results. The outcomes of this research provide a potential tool for service engineers
equipped with portable HD PC to analyze measured AE signals during monitoring to
detect damages that may occur in wind turbine blades at each stage of operation, including
quality control after production.
The accuracy and reliability of acoustic emission technology for wind turbine blade
inspection is a matter of using appropriate AE signal recorder Ô¨Ålters. Moreover, by using
appropriate sensors, it is possible to non-invasively and remotely determine the precise lo-
cation of the blade damage. It is likely that the development of interconnected microsensors
will signiÔ¨Åcantly improve the application of the diagnostic method proposed by the authors.
Using a matrix of interconnected sensors placed over the entire blade would be an ideal
solution. This would be a measurement similar to those currently used in diagnosis which
use acoustic emission, e.g., of pressure vessels. However, the use of the coherence function
itself expands the possibilities by quickly recognizing the frequency bands associated with
the relevant damage and excluding possible "parasitic" signals coming from sources other
than the blade.
