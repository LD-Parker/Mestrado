 Abstract --- Wind energy is one of the important renewable 
energy resources because of its reliability d ue to the development  
of the technology  and relative less cost. “The wind energy are 
converted into electrical energy using rotating blades which are 
connected to the generator. Due to environmental conditions and 
large structure, the blades are subjected to various faults and 
cause the lack of productivity. The downtime can be reduced 
when they are diagnosed periodically using structural health 
monitoring. These are considered as a pattern recognition 
problem which consist of three phases, namely feature 
extraction, feature selection and feature classification. In this 
research, statistical features are extracted from vibration signals, 
feature selection are carried out using J48 algorithm and the 
feature classification is done with a rotation forest  algori thm.”

I. INTRODUCTION  
Wind energy turns into the most requested resource in 
present  era b ecause of universal  environmental  contagio n 
[1]. “Wind energy is one of the proficient renewable sources 
and another  choice  for normally  used sources. Wind turbine 
are used to convert wind energy into electrical energy . To 
make wind energy more focused from different sources of 
energy, like perfor mance, accessibility, reliability, 
effectiveness, the life of turbines must be improved [2].  The 
wind makes the rotor cutting edge turn, thus making the 
pole inside the wind turbine turn. The flimsy, long and 
malleable sharp edge is the part suffers the mo st extreme 
complex forces. It is easy to initiate vibration [3 ]. The 
rehashed and severe vibration will prompt damage to the 
cutting edge and last to  failure . The cutting  edge is one of 
the vital parts  with rehashed failure . Due to its massive  
construction  and functioning  condition, the vibration of the 
cutting  edge is challenging  to compute  on-line. In this study, 
fault diagnosis on wind turbine blade is carried out using 
vibration signals through machine learning approach .” 
A data -driven approach for moni toring blade pitch faults 
in wind turbines  was carried out by Andrew Kusiak and

II. EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES  
The main aim of this study is to classify whether the 
blades are in good condition or in a defective state. “If it is 
defective, then the objective is to identify the type of fault.  
The experimental setup and ex perimental procedure are 
described in the following subsections.  
Experimental Setup  
The experiment was carried out on a 50W, 12V variable 
speed wind turbine (MX -POWER, model: FP -50W -12V) 
[11]. The technical parameters of a wind turbine are given in 
Table 1. 
The wind turbine was mounted on a fixed steel stand in 
front of the open circuit wind tunnel outlet. The wind tunnel 
speed ranges from 5m/s to 15 m/s and acts as a wind source 
to start the wind turbine. The wind speed was varied 
continuously in order to simulate th e environmental wind 
condition.  
The experimental setup is shown in Figure 2. 
Piezoelectric type accelerometer was used as a transducer 
for acquiring vibration signals. It has high se nsitivity for 
detecting faults.  
Hence, accelerometers are widel y used in condition 
monitoring. In this case, an uniaxial accelerometer of 500g 
range, 100 mV/g sensitivity, and resonant frequency around 
40 Hz was used. ”  Table 1 : Technical Parameters of Wind Turbine

The piezoelectric accelerometer (DYTRAN 3055B1) was 
mounted on the nacelle near to the wind turbine hub to 
record the vibration signals using an adhesive mounting 
technique. “It was connected to the DA Q system through a 
cable. The data acquisition system (D AQ) used was NI USB 
4432 model.  
The DAQ card has five analogue input channels with a 
sampling rate of 102.4 -kilo samples per second with 24 -bit 
resolution. The accelerometer is coupled to a signal 
conditioning unit which consists of an inbuilt charge 
amplifier and an analogue -to-digital converter (ADC). From 
the ADC, the vibration signal was taken.  
These vibration signals were used to extract features 
through feature extraction technique. One end of th e cable is 
plugged to the accelerometer and the other end to the AIO 
port of DAQ system. NI – LabVIEW was used to interface 
the transducer signal and the system (PC). ”

Experimental Procedure  
In the present study, three -blade variable horizontal axis 
wind turbine (HAWT) was used. “Initially, the wind turbine 
was considered to be in good condition (free from defects,

 new setup) and the signals were r ecorded using an 
accelerometer. These signals were recorded with the 
following  specifications.  
1. Sample length: The sample length was chosen 
long enough to ensure data consistency; and also 
the following points were considered. ARMA 
measures are more meaningful when the number of 
samples is sufficiently large. On the other hand, as 
the number of samples increases the computation 
time increases. To strike a balance, a sample length 
of 10000 was chosen.  2. Sampling Frequency:  The sampling frequency 
should be at least twice the highest frequency 
contained in the signal as per Nyquist samplin g 
theorem. By using this theorem sampling 
frequency was calculated as 12 kHz (12000Hz).  
3. Number of samples:  Minimum of 100 (hundred) 
samples were taken for each condition of the wind 
turbine blade and the vibration signals were stored 
in data files.

Figure 3:  Various Blade Fault Conditions  
The following faults were simulated one at a time while 
all other components remain in good condition and the 
corresponding vibration signals were acquired.  
Figure 3 shows the different blade fault conditions which 
are simulated on the blade.  
a) Blade bend (BB):  This fault occurs due to the 
high-speed wind and comp lex forces caused by the wind. The blade was made to flap wise bend with 
10 º angle.  
b) Blade crack (BC -2): This occurs due to foreign 
object damage on the blade while it is in operating 
condition. On the blade, 15mm crack was made.

Figure 4 : Vibration Signal Plot  
c) Blade erosion (BE):  This fault is due to the 
erosion of the top layer of the blade by the high -
speed wind. The smooth surface of the blade was 
eroded using emery sheet (320Cw) to provide an 
erosion effect on the blade.  
d) Hub -blade loos e contact:  This fault generally 
occurs on a wind turbine blade due to an excessive 
runtime or usage time. The bolt connecting the hub 
and blade was made loose to obtain this fault.  
e) Blade pitch angle twist (PAT):  This fault occurs 
due to the stress on the blade caused by high -speed 
wind. This makes the pitch get twisted, creating a 
heavy vibration to the framework.  To attain this 
fault, blade pitch was twisted about 12º angle with 
respect to the normal blade condition.  
In Figure 4, the vibration signals (s ample number vs. 
amplitude) are shown which were taken for different conditions of the wind turbine blade (good condition blade, 
blade bend, blade erosion, hub -blade loose connection, 
blade crack and pitch angle twist). ” 
III. FEATURE EXTRACTION USING 
STATISTICA L ANALYSIS  
The vibration signals were attained for good and other 
defective conditions of the cutting edge. “If the time domain 
sampled signals are given directly as inputs to a classifier, 
then the number of samples should be constant.  The 
number of samp les attained which are the purposes of

 various speeds. Additionally, the capacity of digitized data 
points on a signal is too extensive. Usually, the work of 
classifiers may not handle it pr oficiently. So, a limited 
features need be extracted formerly the classification 
process. Descriptive statistical parameters [12] such as sum, 
mean, median, mode, minimum, maximum, range, 
skewness, kurtosis, standard error, standard deviation and 
sample va riance were work out to assist as features in the 
feature extraction procedure.  
 Sum: It is the sum of all feature values for each 
sample.  
 Mean: The arithmetic average of a set of values or 
distribution.  
 Median: Middle value sorting out the greater and 
lesser splits of a data set.  
 Mode: Most frequent value available in the data 
set. 
 Minimum value: It refers to the least signal point 
value in a given signal.  
 Maximum value: It refers to the extreme signal 
point value in a given signal.  
 Range: Difference in ext reme and least signal point 
values for a given signal.  
 Skewness: Skewness illustrates the degree of 
irregularity of a distribution around its mean. The 
following formula was used for calculation of 
skewness.  
   (1) 
 Kurtosis: Kurtosis point tow ard the flatness or the 
spikiness of the signal. Its value is very low for 
normal condition of the blade and high for the 
faulty condition of the blade due to the spiky nature 
of the signal and „s‟ is the sample standard 
deviation  
   (2) 
 Stand ard error: Standard error is a measure of the 
amount of error in the prediction of y for an 
individual x in the regression, where x and y are 
the sample means and „n‟ is the sample size.  
    (3) 
 Standard deviation: This is a measure of the act ual 
energy or power content of the vibration signal. 
The following formula was used for calculation of 
standard deviation.  
    (4) 
 Sample variance: It is the variance of the signal 
points and the following formula was used for 
calculation of s ample variance.  
      (5) 
When the statistical feature extraction is completed, the 
values are taken and the feature selection method is carried 
out. The statistical feature aids as the input to the feature 
selection method. With the selected feature the further 
classification is carried out. ” IV. FEATURE SELECTION USING J48 
ALGORITHM  
J48 decision tree algorithm is adapted from the C4.5 
algorithm in WEKA [13]. “It consists of a number of 
branches, one root, a number of nodes, and a number of 
leaves . One branch is a chain of nodes from the root to a 
leaf, and each node involves one attribute. The occurrence 
of an attribute in a tree provides information about the 
importance of  the associated attribute [14].  
A decision tree is a tree based knowledge r epresentation 
methodology used to represent classification rules. J48 
decision tree algorithm is a widely used one to construct 
decision trees [15]. The procedure of forming the decision 
tree and exploiting the same for feature selection is 
characterized b y the following:  
1. The set of features available at hand forms the 
input to the algorithm; the output is the decision 
tree.  
2. The decision tree has leaf nodes, which represent 
class labels, and other nodes associated with the 
classes being classified.  
3. The br anches of the tree represent each possible 
value of the feature node from which they 
originate.  
4. The decision tree can be used to classify feature 
vectors by starting at the root of the tree and 
moving through it until a leaf node, which provides 
a classif ication of the instance, is identified.  
5. At each decision node in the decision tree, one can 
select the most useful feature for classification 
using appropriate estimation criteria. The criterion 
used to identify the best feature invokes the 
concepts of en tropy reduction and information 
gain.  
Information gain measures how well a given attribute 
separates the training examples according to their target 
classification.  
The measure is used to select the candidate features at 
each step while growing the tree [1 6]. Information gain is 
the expected reduction in entropy caused by portioning the 
samples according to this feature.  
Information gain (S, A) of a feature A relative to a 
collection of examples S, is defined as:  
  (6) 
where Value (A) is the s et of all possible values for 
attribute A, and Sv is the subset of S for which feature A has 
value v. Note the first term in the equation for gain is just 
the entropy of the original collection S and the second term 
is the expected value of the entropy aft er S is partitioned 
using feature A.  
The expected entropy described by the second term is 
simply the sum of the entropies of each subset Sv, weighted 
by the fraction of samples |Sv|/|S| that belong to Sv. Gain (S, 
A) is, therefore, the expected reduction i n entropy caused by 
knowing the value of feature A. Entropy is a measure of 
homogeneity of the set of examples and it is given by

      (7) 
where, c is the number of classes, Pi is the proportion of S 
belonging to class „i‟ . 
The J48 decision t ree algorithm has been applied to the 
problem of feature selection. The input to the algorithm is 
the set of statistical features described above and output of 
the decision tree shown in Figure 5.  
It is clearly shown that the top node is the best node for 
classification. The other features in the nodes of decision 
tree perform in descending order of significance.  
It is to be mentioned here that only features that 
contribute to the classification appear in the decision tree 
and other features do not contribu te much. The features 
which have the less discriminating capability can be 
consciously discarde d by deciding on the threshold.  
This concept is made use for selecting good features. The 
algorithm identifies the good features for the purpose of 
classificatio n of the given training data set, and thus reduces 
the domain knowledge required to select good features for 
patte rn classification problem [17].  
Referring from Figure 5, one can identify the most 
dominating features to represent the blade conditions are t he 
sum, range,  standard  deviation, and kurtosis.   
 Figure 5: J48 Tree Classification for Feature Selection  
V. FEATURE CLASSIFICATION – ROTATION 
FOREST ALGORITHM  
Rotation Forest  [18] is a new proposed strategy for 
building classifier ensembles utilizing indiv idually prepared 
decision trees. “It was observed to be more exact than 
bagging, AdaBoost  and random forest. Rotation f orest lures 
upon the r andom  forest views . The base classifiers are 
similar to  individually  made  decision  trees, yet in rotation 
forest ev ery tree is trained on the full data set in a rotated 
feature space . 
As the tree learning algorithm  formulates  the 
classification  areas utilizing hyper planes parallel to the 
feature axes , a slight pivot of the axes might lead to an 
altered tree . The impac t of turning the axes is that 
classification  areas  of high accuracy  can be developed with 
less trees than in bagging  and AdaBoost.  
Random forest and bagging offers remarkable outcomes 
with very bulky ensembles having a huge number of 
estimator results in t he enhancement of the accuracy of 
these approaches  [19]. On the contrary, rotation forest is intended to work with a 
lesser number of ensembles.  The quantity of trees necessary 
in the forest is commonly indicated by the user.  Algorithm 
for rotation forest is as follows  
 Let T be the quantity  of trees necessary  to be built.  
 Start with iterating from one over T, that is, we 
build T trees.  
For individual  tree T, perform the following steps:  
 Split the features  in the training set into K non-
overlapping subcatego ries of equal size.  
 We have K datasets, each with K features . For each 
of the K datasets, we continue  to do the following:  
o Bootstrap 75% of the data from each K 
dataset and practice  the bootstrapped 
illustration  for further steps.  
o Run a principal componen t analysis  (PCA)  
on the ith subset in K. Retain all the 
principal components. For each feature j in 
the Kth subset, we have a principle 
component, a. Let's indicate  it as aij, where 
it‟s the principal component for the jth 
feature  in the ith subset.  
o Store the principal components for the 
subset.  
 Create a rotation matrix of size, n x n, where n is 
the total number of features . Assemble  the 
principal component in the matrix such that the 
components match the position of the feature in the 
original training da taset.  
 Project the training dataset on the rotation matrix 
using the matrix multiplication.  
 Construct  a decision tree with the projected dataset.  
 Store the tree and rotation matrix.  
PCA is an unsupervised technique  [20]. In multivariate  
statistical  problem s, PCA is used to decrease  the dimension 
of the data with nominal  data loss or, in other words, keep  
determined  variation in the information . 
In PCA, we find the directions  in the information  with the 
most variation, that is, the eigenvectors resultant  to the 
prevalent  eigenvalues of the covariance matrix and project 
the data onto these directions.  
With a dataset (n x m) with n instances and m 
dimensions, PCA projects it onto a smaller subspace (n x d), 
where d << m. ” 
VI. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 The vibration s ignals were recorded for good 
condition blade and other fault conditions of wind turbine 
blade. “Totally 600 samples were collected; out of which 
100 samples were from good condition blade.  
For other faults like blade bend, erosion, blade crack, 
hub-blade loose connection, pitch angle twist, 100 samples 
from  each condition were collected.  
The statistical features were extracted as features and 
serves as input to the algorithm. The corresponding 
condition of the classified data will be the required output of  
the algorithm  [21-24].

 The faults are created and compared with the good 
signal to predict whether the blade is faulty or not and the 
classifier performance is verified by 10 -fold cross validation 
[25-27]. In confusion matrix (Table 2), the diagonal 
elements denote  the properly classified instances and the 
others are misclassified once. The classification accuracy of 
rotation forest algorithm is found to be 90.67%. Table 1 
represents the confusion matrix of the rotation forest 
classifier. From this classifier, the k appa statistic was found 
to be 0.888 with the mean absolute error to be 0.0574. The 
root mean square error value is very less about 0.1611. ”

The detailed class  wise accuracy of the rotation forest 
algorithm is shown in Table 3.TP is used to predict the ratio 
of positives which are correctly classified as faults. “FP is 
commonly described as a false alarm in which the result that 
shows a given fault  condition has been achieved when it 
really has not been achieved [2 8-31]. The true positive (TP) 
rate should be close to 1 and the false positive (FP) rate 
should be clos e to 0 for a better classifier . One can observe 
from Table 3, the TP rate of most of the classes are close to 
1 and FP rate was close to 0. This reassures that the result 
presented by confusion matrix in Table 4.  
Precision, recall,  and f -measure are correlated. Precision 
is the probability of retrieved instances that are relevant to 
the cl ass. That is, it is the ratio of true positive (TP) to the 
retrieved instances (TP+FP). It is expressed as 
  . 
Precision is also called as the positive predictive value and 
can be defined as a measure of exactness or quality . The 
recall  is the information retrieval is the probability of the 
faults that are relevant to the classification that was 
successfully retrieved. That is, the ratio of true positive (TP) 
to the overall instances (TP+FN). False negative (FN) is 
considered as type 2 error in which the instances indicate the misclassification however, it is actually correctly classified. 
It is expressed as 
  . The r ecall  is also called as the 
measure of completeness or quantity  [32-37].” 
VII. CONCLUSION  
The wind turbine is very important  in the production of 
wind energy in day to day life. This paper presents an 
algorithmic based clarification of vibration signals for the 
assessment of wind turbine blade conditions. “From the 
acquired vibration data, a model was developed using data 
model ling technique. Rotation forest algorithm was used to 
learn and classify the different conditions of the blade. The 
model is tested under 10 -fold cross validation and correctly 
classified instances was found to be 90.67%. The error rate 
is relatively less and may be considered for the blade fault 
diagnosis. Hence the rotation forest  can be practically used 
for the condition monitoring of wind turbine blade to reduce 
the downtime and to provide more wind energy. ”
