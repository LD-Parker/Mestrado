Abstract: Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) are omnidirectional turbomachines commonly used
in rural areas for small-to-medium-scale power generation. The complex ﬂow observed in the wake
region of VAWTs is affected by a number of factors, such as rotor blades design. A damaged rotor
signiﬁcantly alters the ﬂow ﬁeld in the wake region of the VAWT, degrading its power generation
capability. Published literature on damaged wind turbine blades is severely limited to torque signal
analysis and basic ﬂow ﬁeld description in the wake region. In this study, detailed numerical
investigations have been carried out to establish and quantify the relationship between damaged
rotor and the wake dynamics of a VAWT. Time-based Computational Fluid Dynamics analyses
have been performed on two VAWT models, one undamaged and the other with a missing rotor
blade. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition has been used to extract the energy content and temporal
coefﬁcients of the various ﬂow patterns associated with the wake region. The results indicate that
the ﬁrst pressure-based ﬂow mode contains 99% of the energy and provides a functional basis for
accurate reconstruction of the wake. It is envisaged that this study will aid the development of novel
machine learning algorithms for rotor damage detection in wind farms.

1. Introduction
Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) are preferred over Horizontal Axis Wind Tur-
bines (HAWTs) in urban settings due to a number of reasons, such as their smaller size,
easier installation and maintenance, lower start-up torque, omnidirectionality, etc. As with
any other turbomachine, the momentum transfer component of a VAWT is its rotor, compris-
ing of several rotor blades. These rotor blades are conventionally designed using the Blade
Element Momentum Theory [ 1]. The aerodynamic design of rotor blades results in a well-
deﬁned performance spectrum for that particular VAWT type (Savonius, Darrieus, etc .).
Any changes to the geometric design of rotor blades lead to a different performance spec-
trum. These design changes can be intentional (by design engineers for speciﬁc reasons) or
as a result of catastrophic events, such as bird strike, hail, gusts, etc. , resulting in a damaged
VAWT. Damage to a VAWT’s rotor blades alters the corresponding ﬂow ﬁeld. When this
altered ﬂow ﬁeld interacts with the damaged blades, the resulting power generated by the
blades can be signiﬁcantly different to a healthy (nondamaged) VAWT.
Many research studies have been carried out in order to analyse the ﬂow ﬁelds as-
sociated with VAWTs and the effects of a damaged rotor on power generation. The most
common tool researchers have used for this purpose is Computational Fluid Dynamics
(CFD). One of the major challenges of CFD modelling, to predict the aerodynamic be-
haviour and performance of VAWTs, is to accurately simulate the highly complex ﬂow
in the near-blades and the wake regions of the turbine [ 2]. This is further compounded
by the turbulence in incident air as ﬂow turbulence is inherently a 3D phenomenon, and
its modelling in 2D can lead to signiﬁcantly erroneous predictions of the ﬂow ﬁelds as-
sociated with VAWTs [ 3]. The inability of 2D modelling to accurately capture the blade

tip vortices is another key factor to be considered while developing numerical models
of VAWTs. Resolving ﬂow turbulence in the wake of VAWTs has been a challenge for
researchers [ 4–7]. A well-known approach for accurate prediction of wake turbulence is
to analyse turbulent kinetic energy and the effects of Tip Speed Ratio (TSR) on it. This
approach helps in evaluating the transition from near-ﬁeld to far-ﬁeld wake dynamics [ 4].
Comparative analysis between near-wake and far-wake models show that the former is
a useful tool for designing wind turbine farms [ 3]. Another effective approach for wake
dynamic evaluation is the use of Brown’s Vorticity Transport Model (VTM), where the
vorticity ﬁeld in the vicinity of the wind turbine is analysed to quantify the vertical extent
of the wake downstream of the rotor. The primary advantage of VTM over conventional
CFD-based techniques is its ability to accurately predict the development of turbine wake
downstream; for example, estimation of local dynamic stall due to blade–wake interac-
tions [ 5]. As mentioned earlier, the aerodynamic design of rotor is a dictating factor in
power generation from VAWTs; coupled numerical simulations have been implemented
for accurately capturing blade-to-turbine and turbine-to-farm scale ﬂow dynamics, pro-
viding an enhanced understanding of wakes and enabling the researchers to select better
rotor design parameters in a farm layout. These coupled numerical simulations have the
capability to estimate the inﬂuence of turbine design parameters on ﬂow recovery in the
wake region of VAWTs using the Actuator Line Model (ALM), Large Eddy Simulations
(LES), and Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (URANS) models [ 6]. Research
studies on the comparative analysis between various URANS turbulence models show that
Shear Stress Transport (SST) model provides the most accurate predictions of a turbine’s
wake and dynamic stall [7].
Fault detection and diagnostics of wind turbines research has received a lot of attention
in recent years. Life cycle assessment, fault diagnosis, and Nondestructive Testing (NDT)
techniques have been widely used to detect blade faults and monitor the health of wind
turbines [ 8]. A fault in the blade, such as crack or erosion, can lead to catastrophic failure
and unexpected breakdown of the wind turbine system. Continuous condition monitoring
and fault diagnostic techniques, such as signal processing of structural vibrations and
statistical analyses, are commonly used to monitor the performance of wind turbines to
ensure steady power generation [ 9]. Bayes Net classiﬁer has been reported to be particularly
helpful in this due to its relatively lower error in fault diagnosis [ 10]. Apart from structural
health monitoring, numerical techniques have been used recently for condition monitoring
of damaged VAWTs. CFD-based solvers have been used for the analysis of torque signals
and the ﬂow ﬁeld associated with damaged VAWTs. It has been reported that when a VAWT
loses its blade(s), its power generation decreases from ~2% at lower TSR to ~20% at higher
TSRs [ 11]. Although the effects of large-scale rotor blade faults can be effectively modelled
and analysed through CFD analyses, minor geometrical imperfections are signiﬁcantly
harder to model. CFD analyses of bent rotor blades (5–10deformation) fail to provide any
meaningful difference in the wake ﬂow variables of the VAWT, though a slight decrease in
the average torque output has been observed [ 12]. Numerical investigations on the effects
of orientation of rotor blade damage during a cycle of VAWT’s operation show that the
distinct +ve and ve peaks in the torque signals reduce in amplitude (locally for individual
blades) but the overall amplitude increases considerably, with up to a 7% decrease in the
power output from the VAWT [ 13]. Numerical studies on the effects of slits and missing
rotor blades show that the torque output of VAWTs decreases considerably compared
with undamaged/healthy VAWTs. It has been noticed that small-scale damage (slits) has
negligibly small effects on power generation from the VAWT, as discussed earlier [ 14].
Effects of stator and rotor blades’ angles on the power generation from VAWTs have
been numerically analysed, showing that the stator blade’s outlet angle and rotor blade’s
incident angle have more pronounced effects on VAWT’s power generation compared
with stator blades’ incident and rotor blades’ outlet angles [ 15]. Mohamed et al. [ 16]
extended [ 15] to obtain optimal blade angles for maximum torque generation from the
VAWT. It has been reported that stator blade’s outlet angle of 16.689and rotor blade’s
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2021 ,14, 7060 3 of 27
incident angle of 18.2results in ~19% enhancement in power generation from the VAWT.
Shahzad et al. [ 17] investigated the effects of broken rotor blades of a VAWT on its torque
signals. The damage has been numerically applied to a rotor blade by cutting it into two
parts, with an increasing gap between the two. As the rotor damage applied is small-scale,
the average torque remains almost constant, while the amplitude of the signals increases
by up to 65% for the most severe rotor blade damage. Torque signal amplitude has been
advocated to be used as a scale for measuring the severity of rotor blade damage. Blade
erosion is another important geometrical imperfection that has been reported to degrade
the power generation capability of wind turbines. Numerical investigations on these small-
scale geometrical features show negligible difference between uneroded and eroded blades’
torque signals. Continuous operation of VAWTs in dusty environmental conditions can
lead to 0.2 mm/year of blade erosion [ 18]. Aboufares et al. [ 19] extended [ 18] to analyse the
severity of erosion on VAWT blades. It has been reported that dust particles of 500 microns
in size can erode blades by up to 1.2 mm/year, with the generation of local turbulence in
the vicinity of the VAWT. Zahariev et al. [ 20] conducted extensive numerical investigations
on rotor blade geometry and its effects on the power generation of the VAWT. It has been
reported that those regions of the blades that have an aspect ratio of >10% contribute
~70% towards power generation, while those with an aspect ratio <10% generate <30% of
power. Analysis of wake dynamics reveal that higher aspect ratios of rotor blades generate
localized low-pressure zones in the wake region, with evidence of vortex shedding.
Based on the literature review presented here, it can be concluded that most of the
published literature investigates the two phenomena (damaged rotor’s effects on torque
signals and ﬂow ﬁeld analysis) separately; however, both these are inter-related. Some
studies that do analyse these two phenomena together are severely limited to ﬁrst-order
analysis. In the present study, we aim to link these phenomena together by analysing
(1st order ) and then decomposing (2nd order) the ﬂow ﬁelds in the wake region of a healthy
and a damaged VAWT. We envisage that the decomposed ﬂow ﬁelds will aid in providing
us with tell-tale ﬂow patterns associated with rotor damage, which are extremely difﬁcult
to obtain through conventional ﬂuid-dynamics-based techniques. Accurate recognition
of these ﬂow patterns will help (i) in better understanding the effects of damaged rotors,
(ii) providing a functional basis for the quantiﬁcation of rotor damage (leading towards
low-ﬁdelity modelling of VAWTs), (iii) development of better ﬂow control mechanisms,
and (iv) developing smart algorithms for machine learning that can monitor (for prognosis)
and detect rotor damage in VAWT farms.
2. Numerical Modelling of the Vertical Axis Wind T urbine
The Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) considered was modelled using ANSYS
2021 R1 Fluent®. The numerical modelling involves various stages, which are discussed
individually hereafter.
2.1. Geometry of the Vertical Axis Wind Turbine
The VAWT used in the present study consists of 12 rotor and 12 stator blades, as
shown in Figure 1a. This VAWT has been used in many previous analytical, experimental,
and numerical studies by the author [ 17,21–24] and colleagues [ 11–16,18–20]. The core,
rotor, and stator outer diameters of this VAWT are 1 m, 1.4 m, and 2 m, respectively, while
the height (h) is 1 m. For the damaged VAWT, we have removed one of the rotor blades
(see Figure 1b). Note that the geometric centres of the VAWT models throughout this study
are at (0,0,0).

The dimensions of the flow domain were obtained after carrying out extensive initial 
numerical assessments, ensuring that the flow  fields of the VAWT models (both healthy 
and damaged) do not interact with the boun dary conditions, especially at the inlet, 
top/bottom, and sides of the flow domain. Bas ed, on these results, the specified length, 
width and height of the flow domain are 15 m, 3 m, and 6 m, respectively, as shown in 
Figure 2a. The flow domain was divided into two sections, i.e., the inner and outer sec-
tions, in order to control the mesh quality an d, thus, for accurately capturing the dynamic 
behaviour of the wake. Based on initial assessme nts, it was revealed that the wake region 
of a VAWT extends 4D downstream (D being the dimeter of the stator). Thus, the inner 
section of the domain is rectangular in shap e with a cylindrical head, where the diameter 
of the cylindrical head is 2.5 m and the total length of the section is 10.25 m. The complete 
flow domain, including the healthy VAWT model, is shown in Figure 2b.

2.2. Meshing of the Flow Domain 
The meshing of the flow domain was carried out in three different parts, correspond-

15-mm hexahedral elements, with a higher concentration on the interface between the ro-
tor and the stator regions, as shown in Figure 3a. As in the case of any turbomachine, 
hexahedral elements are preferred in the impe ller zones [25,26]. The inner domain section 
was spatially discretized with hexahedral dominant mesh elements having a size of 30 
mm, as shown in Figure 3b. The outer sect ion of the domain was meshed with 100 mm 
tetrahedral elements.

It is well-established that a mesh suitable for the Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes 
(RANS) simulation is not suitable for Scale-Resolving Simulations (SRS), such as LES [27]. 
The aforementioned element sizes were chosen  after a number of initial simulations in 
order to find the optimal mesh size, where optimal in this context means the balance be-
tween the computational cost and the percentage  of Turbulent Kinetic Energy (k) captured 
within the flow domain (especially in the VA WT and the wake region). For this purpose, 
we defined the following Custom Field Function (CFF):

analyse the mesh quality in the near-wall regi ons, which, in the current scenario, are the 
rotor and stator blades. A f is the face area of the mesh elements (in m2) and y is the cell-
wall distance (in m). a r values of <10 are acceptable for LES simulations. Figure 4a depicts 
the spatial distribution of a r on plane Z = 0. It can be seen that a r values in the near-wall 
regions are higher than anywhere else in the flow domain (as expected), with a maximum 
value of 4.6. Thus, it can be safely concluded that the near-wall regions have been spatially discretized reasonably well.

2.3. Boundary Conditions and Fluid Properties 
The inlet/upstream boundary of the flow domain was modelled as velocity inlet (U). 
The average wind speed in the UK (8.2 knot or 4.2 m/s) was prescribed to the VAWT 
models. The outlet/downstream fa ce of the flow domain was mo delled as a pressure outlet 
boundary, with 0 Pa,g pressure, assuming that  the outlet boundary is far away from the 
VAWT and there are no interactions between the two (this will become evident later in 
the results section). The top/bottom and the si de walls of the domain have been modelled 
as walls, translating in +X direction at 4.2 m/s—the same as the inlet wind velocity—in 
order to avoid build-up of shear layers. The st ator blades remain fixed, i.e., stationary 
walls with no-slip boundary condition. The numerical simulations were carried out as-
suming isothermal conditions, with air having a density ( ρ) and dynamic viscosity ( μ) of 
1.225 kg/m3 and 1.789 × 10−5 kg/m-s, respectively. 
2.4. Rotation of the Vertical Axis Wind Turbine 
As discussed earlier, the VAWT considered in the present study is a Savonius VAWT. 
Studies show that the Savonius VAWTs have a peak Power Coefficient (C p) at a Tip Speed 
Ratio (λ) of about 0.5 [28]. C p and λ are defined here as

Thus, it can be concluded that the mesh quality in the ﬂow domain is reasonably accurate

from the VAWT and there are no interactions between the two (this will become evident

modelled as walls, translating in +X direction at 4.2 m/s—the same as the inlet wind

i.e., stationary walls with no-slip boundary condition. The numerical simulations were
carried out assuming isothermal conditions, with air having a density ( ) and dynamic
viscosity () of 1.225 kg/m3and 1.78910 5kg/m/s, respectively.
2.4. Rotation of the Vertical Axis Wind Turbine
As discussed earlier, the VAWT considered in the present study is a Savonius VAWT.
Studies show that the Savonius VAWTs have a peak Power Coefﬁcient (C p) at a Tip Speed

Based on= 0.5, R = 0.7 m, and U = 4.2 m/s, using Equation (4), we obtain != 3 rad/s
or ~29 rpm, which was speciﬁed as the rotational speed of the rotor.
2.5. Turbulence Modelling
Large Eddy Simulation (LES) was employed in the present study to model air turbu-
lence, in which the large-scale turbulent motion is resolved, while the small-scale turbulent
motion is modelled. For large-scale eddies, ﬁltered Navier–Stokes equations have been
used, while for small-scale eddies, subgrid-scale (SGS) modelling was employed. LES
applies spatial averaging, rather than temporal averaging, to the momentum transport
equation; thus, LES solutions are time-dependent, which is more beneﬁcial for the case
of turbomachinery, such as VAWTs, because the effects of rotor blades rotation can be
captured more accurately w.r.t. time. It is noteworthy here that the entire turbulence
spectrum can be resolved using Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS); however, it is not
feasible for practical engineering applications involving high Reynolds number ﬂows due
to its exorbitant computational cost (~Re t3) [29,30].
The ﬁltered Navier–Stokes (NS) equations can be written as follows:

Here,tis the turbulent viscosity at SGS (also called eddy viscosity), which needs
to be modelled. It has been discussed earlier that SGS eddies are assumed to be isotropic,

2.6. Temporal Discretisation
As with spatial discretization, temporal discretization is also crucial for the accuracy
of time-dependent numerical solutions; however, the computational cost also needs to
be reasonable. Thus, we deﬁned a Custom Field Function (CFF) for the determination of
appropriate time step, for time advancing solutions, as follows:
Dt=V1
3
jUj(14)
where V is the cell volume (in m3) and |U| is the local ﬂow velocity magnitude (in m/s).
The lower limit of Dt, which can capture all of the ﬂow domain, is recommended for LES;
however, higher Dt can be used. Figure 5 depicts the spatial distribution of Dt within the
ﬂow domain. In Figure 5a, the lower limit is set to 0.005747 s, which is equivalent to 1
rotation of the rotor, while in Figure 5b, the lower limit is set to 0.5rotation. It can be seen
that most of the ﬂow domain (except upstream stator and rotor zones) can be reasonably
captured using a Dt of 1per time step. The temporal resolution can be further improved
by considering 0.5per time step. Obviously, there is trade-off between better temporal
resolution and computational resources available/required; we have considered 1rotation
of the rotor blades per time step in the present study.

3. Results and Discussions 
After running the precursor RANS simulati ons, we carried out Large Eddy Simula-
tions (LES) on the healthy and damaged (one rotor blade missing) VAWT models, and the 
results are presented in this section. The LES simulations were run long enough in order 
to obtain a statistically steady solution (a few revolutions). Thereafter, we have recorded 
numerical data for processing and analysis. In this section, we will start our discussion 
with a brief analysis of the torque signals from both the VAWT models and quantify the 
differences between the two. Then, we will an alyse the time-dependent pressure, velocity, 
and vorticity fields of healthy and damaged VAWTs. Afterwards, we present the Proper 
Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) methodology employed, followed by an extensive 
comparative analysis of the POD modes based on pressure, velocity, and vorticity fields.

than the healthy VAWT. The  ve peaks in case of damaged VAWTs depict signiﬁcantly
lower torque values compared with healthy VAWT; thus, it is expected that the average
torque output from the damaged VAWT will be lower than the healthy VAWT. In order to
ensure this, basic statistical analyses were performed on both the torque signals. The results
are summarized in Table 1. As expected, the average torque output from the damaged
VAWT is 2.52% lower than the healthy VAWT, while its amplitude is 66.52% higher. This
indicates that the damaged VAWT experiences signiﬁcantly higher wind loads, which
can have a considerable impact on its structural health. In published literature [ 8–10],
researchers have extensively used digital signal processing techniques to ﬁnd out the
dominant frequencies in the torque signals and have attempted to link them to the damage

different rotor blades’ positions, from 0to 25with equal intervals of 5. The reason for
choosing these blade positions is that they cover the complete journey of a rotor blade from

more evident in Figure 7. It is noteworthy that although rotor torque signals in Figure 6 are

3.3. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)
It is well-established (through the results presented in Section 3.1 and from the liter-
ature review) that a missing rotor blade has a signiﬁcant effect on the torque generating
capability of the VAWT. Let us ﬁrst break this torque degradation phenomena/event down
into different stages. In stage 1, the VAWT loses a rotor blade (catastrophic event). In
stage 2, the ﬂow ﬁeld changes in order to accommodate the effects of modiﬁed geometry
(ﬂow-ﬁeld re-establishment). Finally, in stage 3, the modiﬁed ﬂow ﬁeld interacts with the
modiﬁed rotor blades and consequently, the blades generate torque. Most of the published
studies address stage 3 (which is also very important as far as power generation from
VAWTs is concerned). However, stage 3 is a consequence of stage 2, i.e., re-established
ﬂow features; thus, the root cause for torque variations lies in stage 2. Published research
studies are severely limited to either space-averaged or time-averaged investigations on
stage 2, which provide an overall perspective, as discussed in Section 3.2. In this study, our
aim is to break the re-established ﬂow ﬁeld down into meaningful components and analyse
them individually with a view to identify (and quantify) dominant patterns of coherent
structures in the wake regions of healthy and damaged VAWTs. For this purpose, we use
Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) on the pressure, velocity, and vorticity ﬁelds.
Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) is a mathematical procedure developed
initially by Lumley [ 39] and later extended as Karhunen–Loeve expansion in pattern
recognition [ 40,41] to decompose a time-dependent ﬂow variable into inﬁnite linear combi-
nations of orthogonal, to analyse ﬂow turbulence. There are a number of ways to achieve
this, such as the Snapshot method [ 34], Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), [ 42], spa-
tiotemporal POD [ 30], etc., each having their own merits and demerits. In this study, we use
the Snapshot method to compute the orthogonal modes of the ﬂow ﬁelds. The reason for
choosing this method is its low computational cost. For reconstruction of the original data,
optimal linear basis (or modes) needs to be obtained, which reduce the order of the system
however, still approximating the dynamic behaviour of the ﬂow variable reasonably well.
Let us consider a vector ﬁeld u(x,t), which can be decomposed into its deterministic
spatial functions (t) and time coefﬁcients a(t) as
u(x, t)=n
å
i=1ai(t)i(x) (17)
Time-advancing snapshots of u from the LES data are recorded every Dt and arranged
in matrix form. Modes of u(x,t) are computed from the ensemble of Partial Differential Equa-
tion (PDE) solutions. The inner product between the ﬁeld and the mode is maximized as
maxhju,ji2
kk2(18)
Here, the numerator is maximized for kk2= 1. The modes to be computed should satisfy

dx0= (x) (19)
where is Lagrange multiplier. The eigenfunction of Equation (18) is computed such
that its kernel is the average autocorrelation function hu(x)u(x0)i=R(x, x0). The eigen-

 The spatial distribution of the first POD mode ( ϕ1) in the wake region of both healthy

Figure 13a that the dominant flow structur e for the damaged VAWT is significantly dif-
ferent from the healthy VAWT. The spatial pene tration of wake jet is stronger downstream 
of the VAWT when a rotor blade is missing, and the streamlines are more compactly ar-
ranged at the exit of the VAWT. This is furt her confirmed when we analyse vorticity-based 
ϕ1 in Figure 13c; vortex shedding into the wake region is more pronounced in the dam-
aged VAWT. The velocity-based ϕ1 in Figure 13b fails to provide any significant or mean-
ingful information, both qualitatively and quantitatively, for analysing VAWT damage.

4. Conclusions
Numerical investigations have been carried out in order to analyse the effects of
damaged rotors on the wake dynamics associated with Savonius VAWTs. Large Eddy
Simulations are conducted on healthy and damaged VAWTs, where the rotor damage is
represented in the form of a missing rotor blade. Pressure, velocity, and vorticity ﬁelds in
the wake region of both the VAWTs are obtained, analysed, and compared. It is noticed
that conventional CFD techniques, computing resultant ﬂow variables, provide very little
qualitative information on the differences between healthy and damaged VAWTs, and thus,
are incapable of quantifying wake dynamics through accurate ﬂow pattern recognition.
Proper Orthogonal Decomposition is employed to extract functional basis for the spatial
distribution of the wake region of the VAWTs. Based on the results obtained, it can be
concluded that the effects of damaged VAWT rotors are more pronounced in the pressure
ﬁeld. It is also observed that the ﬁrst pressure-based POD mode contains 99% of the
energy content of the wake ﬂow ﬁeld, making it the dominant mode, and the ﬂow pattern
associated with it the dominant ﬂow structure in the wake region. Wake ﬂow ﬁelds
obtained through high-ﬁdelity modelling of the VAWTs have been accurately reconstructed
using low-ﬁdelity modelling, validating the results of this study. After carrying out pattern
recognition in the present study, we envisage to use the functional basis for the development
of machine learning algorithms to detect damages in VAWT farms.
