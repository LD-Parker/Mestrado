1Introduction
Wind energy is a clean energy source and has attracted considerable attention for satisfying the
ever-increasing demand for energy [ 1]. Wind turbines (WTs) are used for conversion of wind energy
into electricity and provides stable electricity to the grid effectively. To achieve efficient wind energyefficiency and ensure safe operation, adjusting the blade attitude through the WT pitch system iscritical to realize blade pitch control [ 2,3]. Therefore, the operating status of the pitch system directly
affects the state of the WT. Thus, evaluation of the operating status of the WT pitch system is needed.
Studies on WT operation status evaluation is mainly focused on the evaluation of the WT and the
evaluation of key components. WTs have been evaluated using the mathematical model [ 4], regression
model [ 5], neural network [ 6], and machine learning [ 7]. Ouyang et al. [ 8] proposed a support vector
machine (SVM) method based on data partitioning and data mining to achieve state evaluation. Themethod contained three kernel functions, and a power curve model was established to analyze the

deviation degree of the actual model from the normal model by fitting a normal distribution curve.
The performance of the turbine was predicted using multiple linear regression and an artificial neuralnetwork in a wide range of duct opening angles [ 9]. Sun et al. [ 10] proposed to use the long short-term
memory and weighted evaluation method to determine the health level of the WT. A sparse vectoris obtained by the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm, and subsequently the fault feature vector
was extracted. The fault feature vectors were input to the improved AdaBoost-SVM classifier to realize
WT condition assessment [ 11].
The pitch system, which is the core control component of WTs, has been investigated
extensively.Khurshid et al. [ 12] proposed the Kalman filter to estimate the blade pitch angle and
valve spool position of the blade pitch system for state evaluation. In response to the unbalanced
sample categories and complex sample distribution of the operating data of the pitch system of theWT generator system, Tang et al. [ 13] proposed a method for the fault detection of the pitch system of
the WT generator system based on the multiclass optimal margin distribution machine. Zhu et al. [ 14]
proposed multiple model adaptive estimation model based on an extended Kalman filter to estimatethe states of the pitch system. Fang et al. [ 15] proposed a neural network-based condition assessment
method for the pitch system based on the characteristic parameters related to the operation status ofthe pitch system extracted from the SCADA system.
Expert systems and other methods are typically used for evaluating critical components of
WTs [ 16]. In the expert system, historical experience and expert knowledge are used to evaluate the
system, and updating the knowledge base is typically slow and difficult to maintain, which affects thefeasibility of the method. VIKOR is a multi-attribute decision-making method based on ideal pointsby maximizing the group utility and minimizing the individual regret value for the trade-off rankingof finite decision options, and is mainly applied to the evaluation and selection of multi-attributedecision options in management science and socio-economic fields [ 17]. LINMAP is based on a two-
by-two comparison of solutions given by the decision-maker and is a useful method used to determinethe attribute weights and the optimal solution closest to the positive ideal point. The non-consistentmodel based on weighted Euclidean distance can be transformed into a linear programming modelfor solution, but the solution is still complex due to the presence of unconstrained variables in themodel, especially in the case of a large number of objectives, and the solution will be high-dimensional[18]. WT system is a complex comprehensive system, which is affected by many factors, the number of
system parameters is large, and the effect of each factor on the system is fuzzy. The evaluation methodbased on fuzzy theory not only overcomes the shortcomings of complexity, but also does not need torely too much on experimental data, and better process uncertain information. At the same time, italso has a better processing mechanism for the fuzzy and random characteristics of index factors on
system state, which makes this method more suitable for the state evaluation of important components
of WT in complex operating environment.
In the aforementioned study, 10-min data were used for the analysis of the WT pitch system.
However, the 10-min average data cannot reflect the real state of the pitch system satisfactorily.Therefore, this study analyzed the working state of the pitch system in the rated power state and the
underpowered state of the WT based on the second-level data obtained from the SCADA data sample
library. The characteristic parameters and physical mechanism of the pitch system were analyzed, andthe principle of consistency of characteristic parameters, the principle of stability of power under ratedstate, and the principle of stability of blade angle underpowered state were proposed to evaluate theoperation state of the pitch system. Most of the WT operating states are in the rated power state andunder power state. Therefore, the evaluation indexes were established and the fuzzy comprehensiveevaluation method was applied to establish the evaluation models of the operating status of the pitch

system under rated power state and the operating status of the pitch system to realize the evaluation
of the operating status of the pitch system of the WT.
2Introduction of the Pitch System
2.1Working Principle of the Pitch System
The WT pitch system converts wind energy into electricity by controlling the generator speed to
obtain the maximum wind energy utilization [ 19]. The pitch angle is the included angle between the fan
blade and the plane of the wind wheel. When the wind speed is less than the rated wind speed, the pitchsystem maintains the blade angle at the minimum pitch angle so that the WT is in a state of maximum
wind energy absorption. When the wind speed is greater than the rated wind speed and less than the
cut-out wind speed, the turbine retains the output power near the rated power by adjusting the bladeangle. When the wind speed exceeds the wind speed of the WT cut out, the pitch system accepts thecommand from the main controller to realize safe WT pitching [ 20]. The relationship between wind
speed, pitch angle, and power are illustrated in Fig. 1 .

2.2Working State of the Pitch System
The pitch system is a key part of the WT control system. The pitch system behaves differently for
different WT operating states.
2.2.1 Rated Power Status
When the actual wind speed is greater than or equal to the rated wind speed, and the output power
of the WT remains near the rated power, the WT is in the rated power state. To ensure the stable poweroutput of the WT, the pitch system adjusts the blade angle and wind energy generation by the unitaccording to the feedback power signal. Fig. 2 reveals that when the wind speed of the WT is greater
than the rated wind speed, the pitch system adjusts the blade angle according to the wind speed toensure stable output power of the WT.

2.2.2 Underpower State
The underpowered state refers to the operation state where the generator is connected to the grid,
but the wind speed does not reach the rated wind speed; therefore, the WT is below the rated power.The output power of the WT does not reach the rated power, but the WT is in the power generationstate, and the main purpose of the pitch system in this state is to ensure that the wind energy is capturedto the maximum extent. Fig. 3 reveals that when the WT is in the underpowered state, the blade angle
is kept near 0° to let the unit fully utilize the wind energy.

2.3Control Method of the Pitch System
The pitch angle variation is realized by controlling the current of the pitch motor and using the
stalling torque and wind speed to achieve the pitch and ensure stable operation of the system. Currentcontrol exists in all states of the WT. The pitch motor current changes according to the actual windspeed condition. When the actual wind speed increases or decreases, the pitch motor current alsoincreases or decreases to adjust the blade angle at the right position. The WT underpower conditionand rated power condition were analyzed. Fig. 4 displays the pitch state under the underpower
condition. In the underpower condition of the WT, the pitch system does not change angle, but thelocked-rotor current still maintained to keep pitch system working. The current follows the wind speedvariation. Therefore, the blade angle is kept near 0° so that the WT can capture the maximum energy.

The pitch state at rated power is displayed in Fig. 5 . The figure reveals that when the wind speed
increases or decreases rapidly under the rated power condition, the pitch system controls the blade
angle by locked-rotor current. Therefore, the output power of the WT is still maintained near the
rated power.

3Pitch System Characteristic Parameters Analysis
3.1Parameter Introduction
In this study, a 2-MW WT with a rated power of 2000 kW , cut-in wind speed of 3 m/s, rated
wind speed of 11 m/s, and cut-out wind speed of 25 m/s, was investigated. The SCADA data selectedwere second-level data for July 2017. The SCADA system records the characteristic parameterscorresponding to the pitch system, mainly including wind speed, power, blade pitch angle, and pitchmotor current.

3.2Characteristic Parameter Characteristic
(1) Consistency properties of feature parameters
Analyses of the pitch angle and pitch motor current data in the WT SCADA data and the physical
mechanism revealed that the three pitch angles and pitch motor currents of the WT system shouldmaintain similar trend and be close in value under normal operating conditions, as displayed in Figs. 2 ,
3and6.
Figure 6: Pitch motor current
(2) Power stability under the rated state
When the WT is at rated power, the pitch system adjusts the blade angle according to the wind
speed to ensure the stable output power of the WT as displayed in Fig. 2 .
(3) Stability of the blade angle in the underpower condition
When the WT is in underpowered condition, the pitch system should stabilize the blade angle to
work near 0° to allow the WT to obtain maximum wind energy, as displayed in Fig. 3 .
4Pitch System Evaluation Index
The power stability index, R1, the angle stability index, R2, the power residual index, R3,a n d
the pitch angle pitch motor current consistency index, R4, were established by the analysis in the
second and third parts of the paper. Because the power stability is closely related to the wind speed,the wind speed is introduced to establish the power residual index using the prediction model, andthe state of the pitch system was analysed by calculating the ratio of the power residual to thetheoretical power. In addition to the power residual, the working details of the pitch system should
be considered. The details of the working of the pitch system were reflected by the pitch angle pitch
motor current consistency index. The operating status of the pitch system was evaluated by organicallycombining these four indicators. Therefore, the power stability index R
1; the power residual index,
R3, and the pitch angle pitch motor current consistency index, R4, were selected as the pitch system
evaluation indexes under the rated power condition of the unit. The angle stability index, R2, the power

evaluation indexes of the pitch system in the underpowered condition.
4.1Power Stability Index
The power generation capacity of WTs is directly reflected by the output power of the turbine;
therefore, the stability of the output power is a critical measure of the power generation capacity ofWTs. The ratio of WT power fluctuation to its own installed capacity is δ
i. In this study, the average
value of δiis calculated as the power stability index R1.

4.2Angle Stability Index
The variance of the three pitch angles is calculated separately, and then the average value of the
variance of the three pitch angles is calculated. Finally, the average value of the variance of the pitchangles is used as the angle stability index R

Three thousand sets of data of WT in normal operation were selected to develop the BP prediction
model. The wind speed, three blade pitch angles, and three pitch motor current data were used asmodel inputs and the output was power. Here, 70%, 15%, and 15% of the sample data were selected astraining data, validation data, and test data, respectively. The power residual is the difference betweenthe actual power value of the WT and the predicted power value of the model. The theoretical windspeed power data provided by the wind farm was used to obtain the theoretical power, P
q, using the
interpolation method with the wind speed as the input. The average value of the WT power residual,that is, the theoretical power ratio was calculated as the power residual index R

4.4Pitch Angle Pitch Motor Current Consistency Index
Dynamic time regularisation algorithm (DTW) is used to measure the similarity between two
time series. In this study, we first calculate the three pitch angles and three pitch motor currentsseparately to obtain the corresponding DTW distances. Next, the average relative deviation valuesof the corresponding DTW distances are calculated, and finally weight the average relative deviationvalues of the pitch angles and the average relative deviation values of the pitch motor currents werecalculated to obtain the comprehensive consistency index R

5Development of the Fuzzy Evaluation Model for the WT Pitch System
Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is the process of using fuzzy mathematics to quantify all the
factors and indicators related to the evaluated parameter. Next, a reasonable comprehensive evaluationof each evaluation object was used by the principle of fuzzy relationship synthesis. In this study, the
evaluation index is established by analysing the operation status of the pitch system, and the fuzzy
comprehensive evaluation model was used to evaluate the pitch system of WT, and the flow chart isdisplayed in Fig. 7 .

5.1Establishing the Appropriate Evaluation Set and Evaluation Criteria
The evaluation set is the set of comprehensive evaluation results of the WT pitch system, and
the number of elements in the evaluation set is related to the complexity of the evaluation process[21,22]. To obtain reasonable evaluation results, the evaluation set of three elements was selected as
the evaluation set for the evaluation of the WT pitch system in rated power state and under powerstate. Thus, the evaluation set was determined as K={Excellent, Good, Poor }={k
1,k2,k3}.T h eW T
pitch system was evaluated using the evaluation index, and the affiliation of the state ki(i=1, 2, 3)
in the evaluation set vij(j=1, 2, 3). Next, the evaluation results of the index can be expressed by the
affiliation set. This paper selects the widely used weighted average fuzzy operator M=(·,⊕),w h e r e ,
·and⊕respectively represent algebraic multiplication and algebraic addition, that is, the sum of the
product of weight value and evaluation value.
Power stability index R1, angle stability index R2, power residual index R3and pitch angle pitch
motor current consistency index R4were considered as the evaluation indexes of WT pitch system.
According to the relevant regulations and statistical analysis, the evaluation criteria of the WT pitch
system in rated power state and underpowered state were obtained, as presented in Tables 1 and2.
Table 1: Evaluation criteria at rated power

R3 0.050 0.080 0.12

5.2Membership Function
Because calculating the distribution function of the triangular and semi-trapezoidal combination
is easy and does not differ considerably from the results calculated by other complex affiliationfunctions [ 23]. In this study, this function is used to establish the affiliation functions of each indicator
corresponding to various state levels.
For smaller, the membership function is calculated as follows:

where g(x)is the membership function of the evaluation index; xis the measured value of the

5.3Determination of Evaluation Index Weights
The key link in fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is the value of the weights, which directly reflects
the degree of influence of various assessment indicators on the evaluation results [ 24]. The value of
the weights is generally determined by expert experience, which is typically highly subjective and notconducive to reflecting objective facts. To reduce the subjectivity present in determining the weightsand ensure the evaluation results become reliable, the entropy weight method is used to determine the
index weights. The entropy weighting method is based on the principle that the smaller the variability
of an indicator, the less information it reflects, and the lower its corresponding weight should be[25]. Assuming that mevaluation indicators and nobjects exists, for the j-th indicator, its calculation

6Application and Analysis
To verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the evaluation method of the WT pitch system proposed
in this study, two sets of data in the underpowered condition and three sets of data under the rated

power condition of the WT were selected for analysis. Here, 300 data points were obtained for each set
of data. Each evaluation index obtained by calculating each group of data is presented in Table 3 .I n
this paper, the distribution function of triangle and semi trapezoid combination is selected to establishthe membership function of each index corresponding to different state levels. As shown in Fig. 8 .

Because the pitch system of WT in rated power state is primarily used to maintain the stability of
power, the pitch system of WT in under power state is primarily to maintain the stability of pitchangle. Therefore, the evaluation index weights of these two states are not the same. By using theentropy weighting method, the evaluation index weight of the pitch system in the underpowered stateisA
1=[0.483 0.223 0.294 ], and the evaluation index weight of the pitch system in the rated power state
isA2=[0.441 0.275 0.284 ]. According to the subordinate function determination method introduced
in the study, the evaluation matrices of the pitch systems in the underpower and rated power states
were obtained as follows:

The results of the state evaluation of the pitch system in the underpowered and rated power states
according to the fuzzy judging principle are as follows:
B

B5=A2×V5=[0 0.0710 0.929 ] (24)
According to the principle of maximum affiliation, the affiliation degrees of B1,B2,B3,B4andB5
are 0.960, 0.9242, 0.967, 0.701 and 0.929, respectively, which leads to the evaluation results of group 1
and group 3 data as excellent, the evaluation results of group 4 data are good and the evaluation resultsof group 2 and group 5 as poor respectively. The data timing diagram of group 1 data is displayed inFig. 9 , which reveals that when the WT is in the underpowered state, the pitch motor current changes
with the wind speed, the stability of the blade angle is good and remains basically unchanged, and theconsistency of the pitch motor current is good, which is consistent with the evaluation results of thispaper.

The data timing diagram of group 2 data is displayed in Fig. 10 . It can be seen that when the WT
is underpower state, the fluctuation of blade angle is large, and the consistency of pitch motor currentis poor, which is basically consistent with the evaluation results in this paper.

A novel method for evaluating the operating condition of the WT pitch system was proposed in

of the turbine to verify the effectiveness of the method. When the underpower condition is poor, the
fluctuation of blade angle is large, and the consistency of pitch motor current is poor. The rated powercondition is judged by the index variance and coefficient of variation. The new method proposed inthis paper can better evaluate the operating condition of the pitch system, find hidden dangers in time,and avoid safety accidents.
This study proposed a pitch system condition assessment method to evaluate the operational
status of the pitch system. However, identifying the specific type of fault should be considered inthe future. This study focused on the pitch system to establish indicators by describing the operationstatus using the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to assess its operation status. In the future,
the method will be extended to other aspects of the WT, such as generator, gearbox, yaw system, even
