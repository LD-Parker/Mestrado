Abstract: Pitch system failures occur primarily because wind turbines typically work in dynamic
and variable environments. Conventional monitoring strategies show limitations of continuously
identifying faults in most cases, especially when rapidly changing winds occur. A novel
selective-ensemble monitoring strategy is presented to diagnose the most pitch failures using
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data. The proposed strategy consists of Ô¨Åve
steps. During the Ô¨Årst step, the SCADA data are partitioned according to the turbine‚Äôs four working
states. Correlation Information Entropy (CIE) and 10 indicators are used to select correlation signals
and extract features of the partition data, respectively. During the second step, multiple Small-World
Neural Networks (SWNNs) are established as the ensemble members. Regarding the third step, all
the features are randomly sampled to train the SWNN members. The fourth step involves using
an improved global correlation method to select appropriate ensemble members while in the Ô¨Åfth
step, the selected members are fused to obtain the Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation result based on the weighted
integration approach. Compared with the conventional methods, the proposed ensemble strategy
shows an e ective accuracy rate of over 93.8% within a short delay time.

1. Introduction
Doubtless, safe operation of the pitch system is a key to ensure power stability and reliable braking
of wind turbines [ 1]. The dynamic turbulence or unsteadiness gusts not only provide power for the
pitch system, but also produces the most stress or dynamic loading on the blades [ 2]. Historically, pitch
system faults are largely caused by dynamic loading situations due to uncertainty in the wind resource
intensity and duration [ 3,4]. Such situations have frequently led to tragic accidents, as well as casualties
and asset losses. The pitch system, therefore, has to frequently change blade angles and adjust blade
speed to avoid being destroyed [ 5]. It is worth mentioning that a wind turbine has four working states:
start-up, wind speed regulation, power regulation, and cut-out. The level of the wind speed is the
decision-maker for state transitions, which leads to the coordinated action of the pitch system. When
the wind speed varies over a wide range, the state switches and the pitch system will have an increased
ability to ensure the safety of the turbine. Conversely, when the wind speed Ô¨Çuctuates within a small
range, the state is locked, and the pitch system also performs small movements frequently to capture
the maximum wind energy. Whether it is a large movement or a small one, the pitch movement often
lags behind the wind speed [ 6]. Once a failure occurs, it is di cult to Ô¨Ånd it timely and accurately.
The existing Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system can send an alarm after the
faults, but it has no intelligent monitoring function to provide an early warning and accurate location

information before the fault. The current way relies on operators to detect abnormal situations and
make corrective decisions based on enough safety intelligence.
Generally, fault monitoring approaches are divided into model-based methods and data-driven
methods. The model-based methods use explicit system dynamic models and control theories to
generate residuals for fault monitoring. Alternatively, the data-driven methods use data mining
techniques to capture discrepancies between observed data and that predicted by a model. Such
discrepancies will reÔ¨Çect whether the machine is in normal or failure mode, which requires a classiÔ¨Åer
to judge. Recently, some ArtiÔ¨Åcial Intelligent (AI) classiÔ¨Åers, such as neural networks [ 7‚Äì12], machine
learning methods [ 13‚Äì15], and deep learning methods [ 16,17], have been widely applied in classifying
the incipient faults of wind turbines. These methods are really very e ective for some faults within a
certain working state, but it seems impossible for them to diagnose other faults under other working
states. Considering actual demand, it is necessary to establish a systematic fault monitoring system
that covers multiple dynamic working states. Moreover, a targeted analysis of what types of faults will
occur in di erent states is critical to build the monitoring system.
Fortunately, an ensemble learning technique is a better method in solving the above problems and
Boosting and Bagging are two common approaches of ensemble learning. Boosting [ 18] is a cascade
training method that uses the same data to train the ensemble members one-by-one. It requires a
strong dependency from a series of ensemble members. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, if the former members are not
well trained, the latter members will be a ected and show bad performance. Moreover, Boosting
is easy to be interrupted during training when there is a small interference, leading to the overall
failure of the training [ 19]. Bagging is a separate training approach [ 20] that requires multiple single
ensemble members to perform the same task [ 21,22]. Using this training mode, the ensemble members
are homogeneous or heterogeneous, and their alternative algorithms, such as support vector machine
(SVM), artiÔ¨Åcial neural networks (ANN) and naive Bayes [ 23], should be as simple and e ective as
possible. More importantly, the Ô¨Ånal result of the ensemble learning is a comprehensive decision
output which is obtained by fusing the results of the multiple ensemble members based on a certain
combination method [ 24]. The use of an ensemble learning technique in monitoring pitch failures is
still rare, however. Pashazadeh fused Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF),
Decision Tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classiÔ¨Åers can be used together to detect early
faults in wind turbines [ 25]. Dey compared three cascade fault diagnosis schemes to address the
issue of fault detection and isolation for wind turbines [ 26]. Concluded from the above-limited
applications, the ensemble learning technique is indeed an e cient strategy to identify failures and
improve classiÔ¨Åcation performance. Additionally, the neural networks are often used as the alternative
algorithms of the ensemble members, because the neural network is a ‚Äúuniversal approximator‚Äù and
has better capabilities in processing multidimensional nonlinear data [27‚Äì29].
To achieve the higher fault diagnosis performance, the ensemble learning should have three basic
principles. First, there must be enough data to train the ensemble members. The training data in
this paper are recorded from a wind farm SCADA system for one year, and the Bootstrap sampling
method is used to create samples by varying the data to solve the shortage problems in some data.
Second, ensemble members should have di erent classiÔ¨Åcation characteristics, which are not only
diverse but also complementary. The small world neural networks (SWNN) [ 30] are suitable to be the
ensemble members because they are semi-random neural networks and easily can achieve excellent
performance [ 9,31]. The probability pis used to describe the degree of random reconnection of the
SWNN‚Äôs structures. Most noteworthy is that the SWNNs randomly can produce diverse networks with
dierent structures when probability pis a deterministic value. Additionally, the SWNNs are rather
easy to be trained by forwarding propagation and error feedback when using the same initial values.
Third, a wise ensemble strategy also is required, depending on the types of ensemble members [ 32].
Usually, for the ensemble members based on neural networks, the ensemble strategies use voting,
weighted voting or meta-learning methods to obtain the Ô¨Ånal ensemble outputs [ 33]. An advantage is

the ensemble members are independent and irrelevant, which is helpful to improve the classiÔ¨Åcation
eciency and accuracy.
Consequently, a Ô¨Åve-step selective ensemble strategy for dynamic fault monitoring of a pitch
system is proposed. Taking the Ô¨Årst step, the fault-causing data are partitioned according to the
working states of the wind turbines, the Correlation Information Entropy (CIE) method is used to select
correlation signals from the SCADA system and 10 indicators are designed to extract features of the
partitioned data. Multiple SWNNs are established as ensemble members in the second step. During
the third step, the features are randomly sampled to train the ensemble members. Regarding the fourth
step, an improved global correlation method is used to select appropriate ensemble members. The
selected members are fused to obtain a Ô¨Ånal result based on weighted integration approach in the Ô¨Åfth
step. The Ô¨Ånal result is called the ensemble output. Considering testing and validation purposes, two
case comparisons are used to verify the e ectiveness of the proposed ensemble strategy.
The remaining Sections are organized as follows: Section 2 gives the fault analysis of the pitch
system under di erent working states; Section 3 describes the novel selective-ensemble monitoring
strategy and the entire process of its Ô¨Åve steps; Sections 4 and 5 give comparison examples to
demonstrate the e ectiveness of the proposed ensemble model. Finally, Section 6 concludes this paper.
2. Dynamic Fault Analysis of the Pitch System
To gain a proper grasp of the failure regularity, estimates from statistics provide all pitch fault
information to support the establishment of the fault monitoring strategy. The pitch fault information
includes fault types, the number of faults, and the working state of the wind turbine when a fault
occurs. The structure of the pitch system is Ô¨Årst given, then the pitch fault information is recorded
from a real wind farm. More details about the information analysis can be seen in the following.
2.1. Pitch System
Figure 1 shows an example structure of the pitch system, where a pitch system is installed in the
hub of a wind turbine. The pitch system consists of one central controller and three pitch devices
(the #1, #2 and #3 pitch device). The central controller is the command center of the pitch system,
which is used to control three pitch devices, respectively. Normally, three pitch devices are relatively
independent and each one has its own individual actuator. The three pitch devices, in practice, usually
are working synchronously, therefore, the #1 pitch device is chosen as an example to describe typical
pitch control operations.

2.2. Fault Rules
This part collects 12-month pitch fault information from 30 2 MW-wind turbines in a real wind
farm. The information includes the fault types, the number of faults and the working states of the
wind turbine. Usually, the operation of wind turbines can be divided into 4 working states according
to the level of the wind speed [ 34]. Figure 2 shows an example layout of the four working states in
a wind turbine. The 1st working state is the start-up and grid-connected stage of the wind turbine.
Demonstrated in this state, the wind speed is so small that the pitch angle keeps to the minimum and
the generator speed rises steadily. The wind turbine cuts into the 2nd working state, as the wind speed
increases, to capture the maximum wind energy. The 3rd working state is the constant power control
stage where the pitch system needs to constantly adjust the pitch angle to ensure that the wind turbine
works at the rated power. During the 4th working state, the wind speed is too high, and the wind
turbine will cut out and shut down.

Figure 2 also show s the average wind power curve of 30 2  MW -wind turbines and the fault 
statistic s under  different wind speeds. Taken from  the statistical results shown in Figure 2, the 
distribution of pitch faults is directly related to the working states of the wind turbine. Once the 
working state is determined,  in other words , the corresponding fault types also are determined. , The 
random variation of wind speed , however , necessarily determines that the win d turbine must be 
switched frequently under different working state s. It directly leads to the understanding that  a 
certain fault easily m ight occur in one particular working state , while it might occur rarely in other 
ones, therefore , the SCADA data used to diagnose faults also need to be classified according to the 
working state s. 
The SCADA data is composed of multi -dimensional signal sources which are collected by 
multiple sensors. To accurately locate a fault, the most appropriate SCADA signals should be found 
first. The SCADA system can record more than 100 signals at the same time, and the highest recording 
frequency can reach 60 times per second. When  all the signals are used for analysis and processing, 
the calculation is unimag inable. Additionally , faults cannot be accurately located, mainly due to  the 
strong coupling between SCADA signals. When  a fault occurs at a certain location,  for example,  
multiple signals might alert at the same time. It also is found that there are very complex connections

therefore, it is important to Ô¨Ånd the correlation signals closely related to the faults, which is particularly
helpful for the accurate identiÔ¨Åcation of the pitch failures. A detailed explanation will be reported in

3. Selective Ensemble Monitoring Strategy Based on Small-World Neural Networks
A novel ensemble monitoring strategy is proposed to diagnose pitch faults by using
multi-dimensional SCADA data. Such a strategy is a distributed diagnostic system, which takes four
working states of the wind turbines as four parallel models. Each parallel model is a Ô¨Åve-step selective
ensemble model of SWNNs, in which the Ô¨Åve steps are data partition, SWNN members‚Äô creation,
SWNN training, ensemble members‚Äô selection, and ensemble output, respectively. It is noteworthy
that, in the Ô¨Årst step, the original SCADA data are divided into four sub-datasets according to the four
working states of the wind turbine. To facilitate the description of the next steps, the architecture in
the 2nd working state is selected as an example to display the proposed ensemble strategy, which is
shown in Figure 3.

classification, where the wind speed is the decision -maker for state transitions.  The labels  of 1st, 2nd, 
3rd and 4th represent  the four working states respectively , and  C(v) is the  division criterion which is 
calculated by Eq uation (1). The divided signals  are used for further data processing and feature 
extraction , because it avoid s confusion with other irrelevant data, especially at the beginning of data 
processing.

Figure 5.  The Correlation Information Entropy (CIE) results of 15 initial signals.  
Viewing  Figure 5, select the signals with their CIEs  below 0. 3 as the appropriate signals in 
different  working states . The 1st and 4th working states have no appropriate signals because the pitch 
system is not working  and is not associated with the monitoring signals . Found in  the 2nd and 3rd 
working states, 7 signals and 8 signals  are selected  as the appropriate signals respectively,  where the  
signal  numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12 and 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15 . For m these selected signals in to two 
sets of X2 = {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12} and  X3 = {5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15}, in which  X2 and X3 represent  the 2nd 
and 3rd working states , respectively . Note that the 2nd and 3rd working states will continue to be 
studied in the following work, while the 1st and 4th working states are beyond the scope of this 
paper.  
3.1.3 . Discret ized Fault Feature Extraction  
Extracting  fault features from the appropriate  signals mainly is to find the changing 
characteristics from the time series. Specifically, i t is the process of using discrete values to describe 
a limited sequence . A sliding window is used to intercept data from the appropriate signals. The 
abscissa of the window is a certain period of time, and the ordinate is the value of the signal. The 
intercepted data is call ed a ‚Äúrun‚Äù. Each run should have a label, which is a normal label or a fault  
label . Moreover , 10 kinds of time -domain indicators (TDIs) are designed to calculate the features of 
the run. Th e 10 TDIs are independent but closely related, which  are shown in Table 3 . Actually, the 
runs with normal labels are the v ast majority, and the runs with fault labels are the minority . This 
imbalance d distribution is undoubtedly counterproductive to further classification. A combination  
method  combining  over -sampling and under -sampling [ 33] is used in this case to expand the number 
of fault runs.

working states, respectively. Note that the 2nd and 3rd working states will continue to be studied in

3.1.3. Discretized Fault Feature Extraction
Extracting fault features from the appropriate signals mainly is to Ô¨Ånd the changing characteristics
from the time series. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, it is the process of using discrete values to describe a limited sequence.
A sliding window is used to intercept data from the appropriate signals. The abscissa of the window is a
certain period of time, and the ordinate is the value of the signal. The intercepted data is called a ‚Äúrun‚Äù.
Each run should have a label, which is a normal label or a fault label. Moreover, 10 kinds of time-domain
indicators (TDIs) are designed to calculate the features of the run. The 10 TDIs are independent
but closely related, which are shown in Table 3. Actually, the runs with normal labels are the vast
majority, and the runs with fault labels are the minority. This imbalanced distribution is undoubtedly
counterproductive to further classiÔ¨Åcation. A combination method combining over-sampling and
under-sampling [33] is used in this case to expand the number of fault runs.

According to the correlation signals selection in Section 3.1.2, the signals of X2={2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8,
12} and X3={5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15} are selected as the appropriate signals for future diagnosing of
the pitch failures. Taking the 2nd working state as an example, the process of discretizing feature
extraction for the seven signals in X2is described as follows:
(1) DeÔ¨Åne a new dataset Xt, including the X2={2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12} and the label set of yn(Fi).
Xt=xn(t)	,n=2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12 (7)
xn(t) = [xn(1),xn(2), ...,xn(t),yn(Fi)] (8)
where, tis the sampling size; nis the nthsignal, which is shown in Table 2. xn(t) represents the tth
value in the nth signal. yn(Fi) is the label information, Fiis the fault types which are shown in
Table 1.
(2) Calculate the features of the signals based on the 10 TDIs separately, then combine the features to
obtain a simpliÔ¨Åed discrete data matrix of Xn(II), which is deÔ¨Åned as Equation (9).
(3) Repeating the above two steps, the feature matrix of the 3rd working state can be calculated
simultaneously. The discrete data matrix Xn(III) is described in Equation (10).

there are 70 TDIs and 7 label values in the 2nd working state, 80 TDIs and 8 label values in the 3rd
working state. These TDIs and label values will be used to train SWNNs.
3.2. SWNN Members Creation
Generally, if the ensemble members are accurate and diverse, the ensemble model will be more
accurate than any of its individual members [ 28], however, for neural network ensemble members,
one drawback is that the initial situations almost determine the e ect of the network. Such situations
include initial parameters, training data, topology, and the learning process. Fortunately, SWNNs have
been optimized in these initial situations and are well suited to be the ensemble members.
The SWNN is a middle ground neural network between regularity and disorder networks [ 9,35].
The probability p(0<p<1) is used to probe the intermediate region. When p=0 or p=1, the SWNN
are completely regular or completely random. While pincreases from 0 to 1, the SWNN becomes
increasingly disordered and all connections between neurons are rewired randomly. Additionally,
once the number of input, output and hidden layer neurons of the network are determined, there
will be a deÔ¨Ånite value of pto enable the whole network to achieve the highest clustering with the
shortest characteristic path length. Quite the opposite, the SWNN also can randomly reconstruct
diverse networks with di erent structures under the same value of probability p. Compared with the
traditional neural networks, the SWNN easily can obtain various network structures by modifying
pvalues rather than setting a large number of initial values or changing the number of neurons
or layers.
The SWNN‚Äôs structure, topology and the detailed training formulas are based on the existing
study [ 9]. Figure 6 shows the example SWNN structure of the ensemble model in the 2nd working
state, where the red thick lines are the rewiring edge, and the dashed lines are the rewired edges. The
detailed parameters of the SWNN will be set in Section 4.

input neurons is 70, which matches 70 TDIs in Eq uation  (9). Three  hidden layers  are selected with 70 
hidden neurons in each layer , and the  activation function is  a Logistic function. The number of output 
neurons is 10, representing 10 kinds of fault label s in Eq uation  (9). Similarly,  when constructing  the 
SWNN  ensemble member s for the 3rd working state , the number of input hidden neurons are 80 to 
correspond the 80 TDIs in Eq uation  (10). The training process of the SWNN  will now be introduced . 
3.3. SWNN  Training  
The SWNN ensemble members will be trained using different datasets. SWNN is a multi -layer 
forward neural network, which  is trained by leaping forward -propagation and backward -
propagation . Equation  (11) shows the weight matrix  of the SWNN,  where  the values on the diagonal 
line represent the weights of the regular network, while those not on the diagonal line represent the 
weights of random reconnection.  The reconnection  weight s will determine the way of propagation,

Each SWNN is trained by di erent datasets for training the ensemble members. Such datasets

each iteration of the back-propagation algorithm until Etotalconverges.
3.4. Selecting Appropriate Ensemble Members
Following training, each individual SWNN member has generated its own result, however, if there
are a great number of individual members, a subset of representatives to improve ensemble e ciency
needs to be selected. Existing research has proven that the selective ensemble technique can discern
many members from allto achieve better classiÔ¨Åcation accuracy [ 29]. An improved global correlation
based on the Pearson Correlation Coe cient is proposed to select the appropriate SWNN members.
Suppose that there are nensemble members ( f1,f2,:::,fn), and each member has pforecast values.
Then the total error matrix Etotalcan be represented by Equation (14):

During the previous steps, several appropriate ensemble members of SWNN have been selected.
Regarding the subsequent task, a Ô¨Ånal decision value is obtained by combining the results of the
selected members based on the weighted integration method.
Suppose that there are mmembers retained, the outputs of the members could construct a column
vector fiaccording to the fault types in Table 1. fican be represented as Equation (21):
fi= [f1
i,f2
i, ...,fk

where, i=1, 2,:::,mstands for the ithensemble member. fk
i(k=1, 2,:::,p) is the predictive probability
of the kthoutput neurons in the ithmember, whose ranges is in [0, 1]. All the outputs, therefore, can be
constructed by a matrix f:

To summarize, the multistage reliability-based SWNN ensemble model can be concluded in the
following steps:
(1) Pretreat the original SCADA data and extract its features to construct ntraining datasets, TR 1,
TR2,:::, TR n.
(2) Train nSWNNs ensemble members with ntraining datasets.
(3) Select mappropriate members based on a weighted integration method.
(4) Fuse multiple SWNN members‚Äô outputs into an aggregated value.
4. Experimental Validation
Actual data is used to train the ensemble model of SWNN and then applied to detect nine kinds
of the abrupt and incipient faults. The training data is originated from the SCADA systems of 30
2MW-wind turbines in a wind farm for one year.
4.1. Case Preparation
Thirty SWNN members are established, respectively, for the 2nd and 3rd working states of the
wind turbines, and their parameters are as shown in Table 4:

Notably, for meeting the reliable performance, 26,000 runs of time-series datasets were captured
to collect the training (TR), validation (VA) and testing (TE) data. Each run contains 3600 consecutive
samples, whose sampling time is 1 second. The three types of data are distributed in accordance with
the following principles:
(1) The TE data should not overlap with others, so 6000 runs were selected at Ô¨Årst for the Ô¨Ånal test of
the SWNN members.
(2) The remaining 20,000 runs were divided into 90% TR data and 10% VA data, using a bootstrap
sampling method, and there were 12,640 runs and 7360 runs, respectively.
(3) The abnormal runs will account for one tenth of the TR, VA and TE data respectively, and the
abnormal runs also need to be allocated averagely in the TR, VA, and TE data.
(4) Repeat sampling 30 times to get 30 groups‚Äô datasets for each working state, then the 30 groups‚Äô
datasets are used to train the 30 SWNN members, respectively.
Table 5 shows an example data distribution in Group 1 for the 2nd and 3rd working states, in
which the F1‚ÄìF9 are the labels of the 9 fault types, and F10 is the label of the fault-free.

SWNN members. It proves that SWNN is very suitable as the ensemble members, and the proposed
selective SWNN ensemble model can detect nine pitch faults e ectively.
5. Comparison Validation
The proposed selective SWNN ensemble model is compared with three existing methods for
online fault detection. The false alarm rate (FAR), the missed fault rate (MFR), and the mean fault
diagnosis delay (MFD) are used as the evaluation indices to evaluate the performance of these models.
5.1. Comparison Approaches
Three comparison approaches are TRSWA-BP Neural Network (TRSWA-NN) [ 12],
SWPSO-Support Vector Regression (SWPSO-SVR) [ 36] and SWPSO learning vector quantization
(SWPSO-LVQ), which are presented brieÔ¨Çy. They have shown good performance in wind power
prediction and fault diagnosis of wind turbines, which are compared based on the former captured data.
TRSWA-NN: This neural network‚Äôs learning process is based on an e ciency tabu, real-coded,
small-world optimization algorithm (TRSWA), which combines EMD (empirical mode decomposition),
PSR (phase space reconstruction), and EMD-based PSR to detect and isolate the faults of wind turbines.
SWPSO-SVR: This scheme uses the combination of support vector regression and small-world
particle swarm optimization for fault detection and isolation in wind turbines.
SWPSO-LVQ: This scheme combines the LVQ network based on the small-world particle swarm
optimization for detection and isolation, which has a good performance for all of the faults.
5.2. Evaluation Indices
The evaluation indices contain false alarm rate (FAR), missed fault rate (MFR) and mean fault
diagnosis delay (MFD). The three indices are calculated as follows:
FAR =li,10.10X
j=1lj,10 (27)
MFR =10X
j=1,i=1lj,i.10X
j=1lj,i (28)
MFD =tfault occurrence tfault detection /isolation (29)
where, lj,iis the number of samples from the ith class but classiÔ¨Åed to the jth class. MFD represents the
delay time between the fault occurrence and fault detection /isolation.

5.3. Comparative Analysis
The same datasets above will be applied to train the three models and the proposed selective
SWNN ensemble model. Monte-Carlo analysis [ 37] is used to calculate the indices and to test the
robustness of the comparison approaches. Particularly, a rigorous test simulation based on 10,000 runs
has been executed, during which realistic wind turbine uncertainties have been considered. Table 7
shows the performance of the selective SWNN ensemble model against other approaches.
The results from Table 7 show the overall e cacy of the proposed ensemble SWNN model.
Particularly in the neural network-based approaches of the ensemble SWNN model, TRSWA-NN and
SWPSO-LVQ, it seems to achieve interesting results with quite low FAR, MFR and MRD for all the
fault cases. More speciÔ¨Åcally, when identifying the Ô¨Årst 7 faults, the maximum FAR and MFR of the
ensemble model are 0.037 and 0.031, respectively, and the maximum MFD is not more than 1.3 s; while,
when identifying the 8th and 9th faults, the FAR and MFR are about 0.1 and 0.08, and the minimum
MFD is 8.5 s. There are many di erences between the two situations, meaning that the ensemble model
has good accuracy and can maintain a fast corresponding speed for diagnosing the Ô¨Årst 7 pitch faults,
but it is not ideal for the latter 2 faults. The same situation occurs in the TRSWA-NN and SWPSO-LVQ
models, which can easily monitor the Ô¨Årst 7 faults. SWPSO-SVR has a very small MFD in diagnosing
all kinds of the 9 faults, however. The SWPSO-SVR has no better FAR and MFR, which means it cannot
guarantee high fault recognition accuracy when dealing with multi-dimensional and large amounts
of SCADA data. Conversely, compared with TRSWA-NN and SWPSO-LVQ, the selective SWNN
ensemble model also shows the optimal results with smaller FAR, MFR and MFD, especially when
identifying and classifying the Ô¨Årst seven pitch faults.

6. Conclusions
Fault diagnosis of wind turbines, as a basic research project, plays a major role in today‚Äôs electricity
markets. The Ô¨Åve-step ensemble strategy proposed is a novel technique that uses the small-world
neural networks as the ensemble members to improve monitoring reliability and classiÔ¨Åcation accuracy.
Compared to the conventional methods, the proposed method can be summarized as follows:
(1) The proposed selective SWNN ensemble strategy provides a comprehensive monitoring
mechanism for most fault types under di erent working states of the wind turbines.
(2) The proposed selective SWNN ensemble strategy decomposes the dynamic monitoring into
four distributed ensemble models, and each model contains multiple SWNNs to selectively
output multiple judgment results. These results can be coordinated to provide consistent fault
classiÔ¨Åcations at a Ô¨Åxed prediction horizon. The classiÔ¨Åcation performance is e ective and
accurate. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the proposed method under di erent working states shows an average
training accuracy and testing accuracy of over 97% and 92%, respectively, when detecting the
most pitch failures.
(3) The proposed selective SWNN ensemble strategy reveals stronger adaptability and sensitivity
than that of the single SWNN, especially when classifying and identifying the abrupt and incipient
faults, with a higher accuracy rate of over 93.8%. Additionally, it is able to use a short delay time
while achieving a lower false alarm rate and lower missed fault rate than the conventional models.
Future works focus on: (1) Regarding data processing, the ratio of normal samples to abnormal
samples needs to be studied. Such ratio will play a decisive role in the Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation results.
(2) Concerning terms of ensemble member optimization, a deep small-world neural network will
be proposed to diagnose the fault of wind turbines. It will be compared with other deep learning
algorithms, such as the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
