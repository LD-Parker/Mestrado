Abstract: With the rapid development of wind energy, it is important to reduce operation and
maintenance (O&M) costs of wind turbines (WTs), especially for a pitch system, which suffers the
highest failure rate and downtime. This paper proposes a data-driven method for pitch- system
condition monitoring (CM) by only using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data
without any faults, which could be applied to reduce O&M costs of pitch system by providing
fault alarms. The pitch-motor temperature is selected as the indicator, and three feature-selection
algorithms are employed to select the most appropriate input parameters for modeling. Six
data-driven algorithms are applied to model pitch-motor temperature and the support vector
regression (SVR) model has the highest accuracy. The control-chart method based on the residual
errors between model output and measured value is utilized to calculate the outliers, thus the
abnormal condition could be clearly identiﬁed once the outliers appear for a period of time. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by several case studies, and compared with
the classiﬁcation models. Due to the adaptive ability and low cost, the proposed approach is suitable
for online CM of pitch systems, and provides a strategy for CM of new WTs.

1. Introduction
As a commercially viable and environmentally sustainable energy source, wind energy has
attracted sustained attention due to its abundance and high social beneﬁts. The number of installed
onshore and offshore wind farms is increasing to satisfy the rapidly growing demand. At the end of
2017, the cumulative installed wind-power capacity of China comprised approximately 188,392 MW,
followed by USA, Germany, India, and Spain [ 1]. However, operation and maintenance (O&M)
costs are still high due to the harsh environment and the early deterioration of critical components.
Condition monitoring (CM) is an effective tool commonly employed to improve the reliability of
wind turbines (WTs) and reduce O&M costs. It allows the maintenance to be scheduled based on the
conditions of WT components [2].
As one of the critical components of WTs, the pitch system has led to the highest failure rate and
downtime according to the results of the Reliawind Project [ 3]. A pitch-system fault could cause severe
downtime events, such as blade fracture, which greatly limits the generating efﬁciency of WTs and
increases O&M costs. Therefore, the CM of pitch systems is crucial for the early detection of pitch
faults so as to reduce the costs and ensure the reliability of WTs.
The CM techniques for WTs have been widely studied based on the various signals, such as
vibration, electrical, temperature, acoustic emission, lubrication oil parameters and supervisory control

and data acquisition (SCADA) signals. Meanwhile, they have been proved effective in detecting some
speciﬁc faults of WT components [ 4,5]. However, it is difﬁcult to apply some of them to monitor
the condition of pitch systems due to unsuitability and complexity. For example, vibration analysis
requires multiple sensors to be installed and large volumes of data to be collected, which consequently
lead to a substantially increasing CM costs. Currently, large WTs are equipped with a SCADA system,
providing a great deal of information on WT operating performance. Thus, the CM method based on
SCADA data is cost-effective, as no additional sensors are needed, and as a result, a number of CM
approaches using SCADA data have been researched in recent years [ 6,7]. Therefore, SCADA signals
were used for pitch-system CM to reduce the expenditure in this paper.
The CM approaches could be generally categorized as the analytical-model-based method,
knowledge-based method and data-driven-based method [ 8]. The analytical-model-based method requires
constructing an accurate mathematical model [ 9]. Considering there are various parameters in the pitch
system and the relationship between components is quite complicated, it is hard to construct the accurate
mechanism model for the pitch system. Furthermore, there is a risk of model failure with the impact of
noise and environmental changes. Consequently , the analytical-model-based method has been rarely used
to detect pitch-system faults, while the other two approaches have been presented over the last few years.
The knowledge-based approach does not require a quantitative mathematical model for fault
detection compared with the analytical-model-based method. For instance, Chen et al. [ 10] presented
a priori knowledge-based adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system to detect signiﬁcant pitch faults
automatically based on the 10-min averaged SCADA data. It has a great interpretability for allowing
expert to introduce a priori knowledge to the system model. Ran Bi et al. [ 11] applied the normal
behavior models based on the performance curves to detect pitch faults. The normal behavior models
were obtained from the WT technical speciﬁcation. Therefore, no training model is needed, but
the knowledge of WT operation and control is required to identify abnormal operation conditions.
Obviously, the accuracy of knowledge-based approaches is highly dependent on professional
knowledge and long-term accumulation of experience, of which the integrity is difﬁcult to be assured.
Compared with the knowledge-based method, the data-driven approach does not require much
priori knowledge and experience. Data-driven models are established by mining information in
historical data. It is applicable for the complex system due to its better adaptive ability.
Jamie L et al. [ 12] proposed a data-driven expert system to detect pitch faults using the 10-min
averaged SCADA data. The RIPPER algorithm was used to generate the rules for the diagnosis of
pitch-fault classes, including “no pitch fault”, “potential pitch fault”, and “pitch fault established”. A
classiﬁcation accuracy of 85.5% was achieved in this system. For accurate classiﬁcation, large quantities
of data are required, especially for historical fault data.
Andrew Kusiak et al. [ 13] developed a data-mining-based two-class classiﬁer to monitor
blade pitch performance using 1-s SCADA data. By comparing the ﬁve data-mining algorithms,
the genetic-programming algorithm was selected to perform the prediction of blade-angle
implausibility faults with the best classiﬁcation accuracy in the range of 68.7–87.4% for 13 time
stamps. The maximum prediction time is 10 min with the accuracy of 68.7%, which can be improved
for better condition-based maintenance.
B. Chen et al. [ 14] applied an approach for WT SCADA alarm processing and diagnosis using an
artiﬁcial neural network (ANN). The trained ANN model was generated to identify if any pitch-system
fault has occurred. However, the method was performed only based on the SCADA alarm signals,
while some other signals with valuable information were potentially ignored. Moreover, the ANN
model is a black box that is completely dependent on a large number of training samples and
consequently loses insight into new problems.
Considering that these data-driven methods have high requirements for training data, for the
effectiveness of these classiﬁcation models depends on large quantities of labeled data, including
historical fault data and healthy data, this paper aims to construct the model by only simply using the
healthy historical data, and as a result, avoiding the difﬁculty of getting large volumes of historical

fault data. Furthermore, it provides a strategy for the diagnosis of new WTs. When constructing the
model, the key to success is to select effective parameters. The status labels are commonly used as the
model output to represent system health status, while the model input is usually determined based on
these labels or research results of other literatures [ 12,13]. However, the model constructed by only
using healthy historical data could not use labels to describe system health status because of the lack
of fault status labels. Therefore, this paper evaluates the operating conditions of the pitch system by
using the suitable indicator, and the related input parameters are determined with an appropriative
feature algorithm in order to improve model efﬁciency and accuracy. In addition, a control chart is
used for the identiﬁcation of abnormal conditions. The model effect is demonstrated with the speciﬁc
pitch-system faults.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a brief description of the WT
pitch system and related SCADA parameters. The model structure and methodology are introduced
in Section 3. The comparative analysis of different data-driven models and monitoring results are
discussed in Section 4, and conclusions are drawn in Section 5.
2. Pitch-System Description and Analysis
The pitch system is a vital component of WT, which ensures the effective utilization of wind
power and the secure operation of WTs in an emergency by adjusting the blade pitch angle. Generally,
pitch systems are divided into hydraulic-pitch systems and electric-pitch systems according to the
different types of drive. In recent years, the latter has been used more frequently due to its extended
control possibilities and higher precision. Moreover, it could avoid the leakage problems experienced
with hydraulic-pitch systems [ 15]. Therefore, the research object of this article is the electric-pitch
system, whose application prospects are better.
2.1. Pitch-System Structure
All parts of the pitch system are installed in the WT hub and rotate with the rotor. Three blades are
equipped with an independent drive system in the hub, respectively. An electric variable-pitch drive
system contains a pitch controller, pitch motor, gearbox, slewing bearing, limit switch, and battery
cabinet, as shown in Figure 1 [ 16]. Speciﬁcally, the central controller calculates the optimal value of
blade pitch angle according to the present wind condition and operation status of WT, which is sent to
the motor driver afterwards. The blade pitch angle is adjusted by controlling the pitch motor. Thereby,
the blade is controlled to the optimal position, driven by the gearbox and the slewing bearing. Besides,
the power supply of the system is obtained via a slip ring, which is mounted between the rotor and the
nacelle. When the external power supply is not available due to a slip ring or grid failure, the backup
battery works to motivate the pitch motor.

2.2. Related Parameters of Pitch Systems
A typical SCADA system collects information of WT subassemblies, including various signals
and alarms. However, there are over one hundred parameters, and only some of them are related
to the pitch system. As for the pitch system, the monitored parameters are mainly associated with
the operation of its components, such as the pitch motor and battery cabinet. Meanwhile, the pitch
system is also related to the operation of other WT subassemblies and environment parameters, such
as generator torque and wind speed. In addition, each SCADA message contains a time record and
corresponding state code, which reﬂect the WT operation status. Based on the domain knowledge,
the parameters which are associated with the pitch system are selected as shown in Table 1.

3. Methodology
Because the fault samples are not contained in the training dataset, the status labels are not
available for representing system health status. As a result, a suitable status indicator was applied
for condition evaluation in this paper. Temperature parameter is a great condition indicator due to
its thermal inertia and strong anti-interference capacity, which means that wind-speed uncertainty
and uncontrollable noise have hardly any disturbance to it [ 17]. In addition, a large number of
temperature data can be obtained directly from the SCADA system. Several temperature parameters
of the critical WT components have been successfully applied to CM as a deterioration indication.
For example, in Reference [ 18], a generator-temperature trend-analysis method was proposed to
monitor the generator condition of WTs. In Reference [ 19], a generator-bearing-temperature model
was generated using neural network algorithms to analyze the generator bearing failures of WTs.
In Reference [ 20], the gearbox faults were predicted using SCADA oil temperature. This paper develops
a pitch-motor temperature model to monitor the condition of WT pitch systems as the pitch-system
operation is mainly driven by the pitch motor. It means that the pitch-motor temperature is used as a
target for monitoring WT pitch system.
3.1. Modeling Process
The pitch-motor-temperature model for pitch-system CM is presented in Figure 2, which mainly
includes the following steps:
1. Data Preprocessing
The SCADA system collects both normal and abnormal data. The training set for modeling
only includes the healthy data collected in the normal operation, excluding downtime, failure,
and maintenance. It could be obtained by removing the abnormal data according to the SCADA state
code and maintenance record. Meanwhile, the data collected during the limited power period were
not considered, which could be determined according to the power limit value in the SCADA system.
2. Feature Selection
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2018 ,11, 2142 5 of 17
In order to improve model performance, it is critical to select proper parameters to construct an
efﬁcient CM system for the pitch system of WTs. The related parameters used for the model input
could be selected from Table 1 with a valid feature-selection algorithm.
3. Model Training and Test
Based on the selected features, the model could be established using healthy historical SCADA
data, which represent the relationship between the features and the condition indicator. Therefore, the
target variable value could be estimated with the trained model and be close to the real value if the
pitch system is normal. Otherwise, there is a possible failure in the pitch system.
4. Residual Analysis
In the interest of a better interpretation for the model results, a proper residual-analysis method
should be applied to identify the abnormal condition. This paper employs the control chart to get the
bound. This means the pitch system might be abnormal when the residual error exceeds the bound.

3.2. Feature Selection  
For constructing an efficient data -driven model, it is crucial to select related parameters as the 
input of the pitch -motor -temperature model. The feature -selection algorithm could be applied to 
evaluate the importance of initial parameters and reduce modeling complexity. As an important 
preprocessing technique, it is widely used in data mining, which can be divided into  the wrapper, 
embedded , and filter methods [ 21]. The wrapper model determines the optimal f eature subset 
according to the objective function, which is usually defined as the performance index such as mean 
square error (MSE), while the filter model gets the feature ranking on the basis of relevance. With 
respect to the embedded model, the feature s are automatically selected with the specific 
machine -learning model. In this paper, three parameter -selection algorithms were applied , 
respectively , to acquire the optimal feature subset. The SCADA data of a turbine collected in four 
months (from 1 Septe mber, 2016 to 31 December, 2016 ) are illustrated for feature selection. During 
this period, there was no failure.  
1. Sequential Forward Selection  
As one of the wrapper methods, sequential forward selection requires a proper learning 
algorithm and evaluation c riteria to determine the feature subset. Here, support vector regression 
(SVR) is applied for modeling, and the MSE between the model output and monitored pitch -motor 
temperature is used to assess the importance of the parameters. It begins with an empty s et. The 
feature making the MSE minimum is added into the set sequentially until the MSE does not 
decrease anymore. Finally, battery -cabinet temperature, blade pitch angle, hub temperature,

Finally, battery-cabinet temperature, blade pitch angle, hub temperature, ambient temperature,
and pitch-motor current constitute the feature set, which makes the MSE minimum as shown in
Table 2.

2. Gradient-Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT)
As a ﬂexible nonparametric machine-learning approach, GBRT can be used to train a regression
model. This paper mainly takes advantage of the automatic feature selection of the GBRT algorithm
as a typical embedded model. In addition, this method considers the correlation between the input
variables compared with mutual information. The relative importance of the features is given in
Table 3. It was found that the MSE is smallest when the ﬁrst ﬁve parameters are selected as the model
input, including hub temperature, battery-cabinet temperature, ambient temperature, pitch-motor
current, and blade pitch angle.

3. Mutual Information
This algorithm measures the mutual dependence between two variables as one of the ﬁlter models.
In this research, it was used to calculate the correlation between the pitch-motor temperature and the
related parameters in Table 1. The results are shown in Table 4.
Obviously, the former two algorithms have the same result. Namely, the pitch-motor-temperature
model has an optimal performance with the following ﬁve parameters as the input variables:
battery-cabinet temperature, hub temperature, ambient temperature, pitch-motor current, and blade
pitch angle. In addition, these ﬁve parameters have a higher correlation with the pitch-motor
temperature according to the result of mutual information. Considering the criteria that input variables
should be highly correlated with the output and less correlated with each other, as a redundant variable,
pitch-inverter temperature is not considered because it is highly corrected with the battery-cabinet
temperature. Therefore, these ﬁve parameters are selected to construct the regression model eventually.
In this case, the R-squared is 0.9056, the MSE is 0.5692, and the mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.5370.

3.3. Model Construction
With the selected ﬁve parameters as the input variables, a pitch-motor-temperature model is
established using the healthy historical SCADA data. There are multiple data-driven algorithms
that could be used to model the pitch-motor temperature, such as ridge regression (Ridge) [ 22], least
absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) [ 23], k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) [ 24], random forest
(RF) [ 25], ANN [ 26], and SVR [ 27]. Considering SVR has the advantages of solving problems such
as nonlinear and local minima point with ﬁnite samples [ 27], this paper applies SVR to establish
the model.
SVR principles are as follow [27].
Given a training dataset D=f(x1,y1),(x2,y2), . . . , (xn,yn)g,xiis the i-th m-dimensional input
vector and yi2Ris the corresponding target of xi. The SVR model can be represented as Equation (1):
f(x)=wTf(x) (1)
where f(x)is the model output, wis the normal vector, bis the bias parameter, and f(x)denotes a
ﬁxed feature-space transformation, which transforms the nonlinear problems in the input space into
the linear problems in the feature space.
SVR assumes the absolute difference between the target yand the model output f(x)is less than
e. Thus, the SVR optimization-objective function is given by Equation (2):

This problem can be achieved by introducing Lagrange multipliers and optimizing the Lagrange
function. Therefore, the dual problem of Equation (3) can be obtained as Equation (6):

Eventually, the regression function obtained is shown in Equation (8) by solving the
equations above:
f(x)=n

i=1(ˆai ai)k(x,xi) +b (8)
where the kernel function k(x,xi)is used to map the training set to high dimension space. Thus, SVR
is capable of solving both linear and nonlinear regression problems. In this paper, the SVR parameters
are determined by grid search.
3.4. Residual Analysis
In order to determine whether a sustained change in the condition of the pitch system has
occurred, an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control chart was applied to identify
the abnormal condition of the pitch system. The EWMA can be viewed as a weighted average of all
past and current observations. It has a smoothing effect on the uncontrollable noise. In addition, it is
very effective against small process shifts. Consequently, the EWMA control chart is typically applied
with individual observations [ 28]. In this paper, an EWMA-based residual analysis method is adopted
for the CM of WT pitch system. The outliers of the EWMA control chart that exceed the control limits
are viewed as out of control, which could indicate impending pitch-system failure.
The raw SCADA data were collected at 10-min intervals. In order to avoid the misidentiﬁcation
of fault events, the moving-average approach is used prior to the control chart to reduce the data noise.
In this research, the window length is set to 6.
The EWMA statistic is deﬁned as Equation (9):
zi=lei+(1 l)zi 1 (9)
where 0<l1is the smoothing parameter, and eiis the i-th residual error, deﬁned as the deviation
between the measured pitch-motor temperature and the model output value. The starting value z0is
the process target m0, which is set to the average of historical residual errors ein the normal operations.
If the observations eare independent random variables with variance s2, the variance of zican be
calculated as Equation (10):

Thus, the EWMA control chart can be constructed by drawing the relationship between ziand i.

depends on the reasonable selection of design parameters, including and L. It was found that 0.05,
0.1, and 0.2 were commonly used values of in practical application, and L=3works reasonably well,
which corresponds to the usual 3 limits [28]. In this study, and Lare set to 0.2 and 3, respectively.
4. Validation and Test Results
In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the model was applied to the CM
of the pitch system of a total of 24 variable-speed and variable-pitch WTs from a commercial wind
farm, which is located in China. The 10-min averaged SCADA data collected from June 2016 to July
2017 are available. The CM results were compared to the different models and the original event
logs. In addition, all the computations were carried out on the computer using Python programming
language (The computer conﬁguration is as follows: CPU: Inter (R) Core (TM) i5-4590 CPU @ 3.30 GHz
3.30 GHz; RAM: 4.00 GB; System type: 64 bit). The data-driven algorithms used in this paper are from
the scikit-learn package in Python.
4.1. Comparative Analysis
4.1.1. Data-Driven Algorithms Comparison
In order to demonstrate the capability of SVR in modeling the pitch-motor temperature, the
SVR model was compared with ﬁve data-driven models developed by ﬁve well-known algorithms,
including Ridge, Lasso, kNN, RF, and ANN. In addition, MSE and MAE were used as metrics to
evaluate the model performance.
In this research, the parameters of each model were determined by grid search with a 10-fold
cross validation in the training. For the Ridge model and Lasso model, the optimal regularization
parameter was selected from a set {0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}. For the kNN model, the Euclidean distance was
considered, and k= 1, 2, 3 . . .10 were evaluated to determine the optimal value. For the RF model,
the number of features to consider when looking for the best split was selected from a set { ‘auto’, ‘sqrt’,
‘log2’ }, and the number of trees in the forest was determined from a set {10, 100, 200 . . .500}. For the
ANN model, three layers was considered, and three activation functions were evaluated, including
logistic sigmoid function, hyperbolic tan function, and rectiﬁed linear unit function. A stochastic
gradient-based optimizer was used for weight optimization. The maximum number of iterations was
selected from a set {100, 200 . . .500}. For the SVM model, a Gaussian kernel was considered. The
kernel coefﬁcient gamma = 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 and penalty parameter C= 1, 10, 100, 1000 were evaluated,
and the combination of them with the smallest 10-fold cross-validation error was selected.
The results in Table 5 indicate that SVR is better than the other ﬁve data-driven algorithms in this
paper. In Table 5, four datasets obtained from four turbines, respectively, were tested to evaluate the
performance of these six models, and each test dataset contains the healthy SCADA data collected in
one month. For each data-driven model, the healthy historical SCADA data collected in three months
were considered as training dataset. Obviously, the SVR-based model provided the lowest MSE
and MAE. Considering the modeling accuracy, SVR is more suitable for estimating the pitch-motor
temperature due to its excellent generalization ability, and, as a result, it was employed to model the
pitch-motor temperature eventually.

4.1.2. Comparison with Classiﬁcation Models
As the classiﬁcation models are often employed to identify the status patterns of a wind-turbine
pitch system [ 10–12], the classiﬁcation models were also compared in this section to further prove
the effectiveness of the proposed method. The classiﬁcation approaches construct the models by
mining the differences between large quantities of historical fault data and healthy data, and the
status label is used to represent the health status of pitch system. In this paper, ANN and SVM
were selected for constructing the classiﬁcation models. The input parameters of the model include
battery-cabinet temperature, hub temperature, ambient temperature, pitch-motor current, blade pitch
angle, and pitch-motor temperature. Using the status labels as the model output, two conditions were
identiﬁed by the classiﬁcation model, including normal operation and pitch-system fault.
In order to compare the performance of different models, three datasets obtained from three
turbines, respectively, were tested. Each dataset contains labeled healthy samples and pitch system
fault samples. Due to the limited volume of pitch-fault data, there were 3856 sets of SCADA data as
the training dataset for the classiﬁcation models, including 1508 pitch fault samples and 2348 healthy
samples. In order to make an accurate comparison, the number of training samples of different models
in the comparison experiment was the same. Similarly, the model parameters were determined by grid
search with a 10-fold cross validation in training, and the ones with the smallest error were selected.
The monitoring results are presented in Table 6. Obviously, the proposed model could identify the
conditions of the pitch system with higher accuracy. Although the accuracy of classiﬁcation models
could be improved by increasing the training dataset, it is difﬁcult to provide sufﬁcient historical fault
samples covering different failure types in practical applications, especially for the new wind farms.
Compared with the classiﬁcation models, the proposed model could identify the abnormal conditions
of pitch systems by only using the same number of healthy samples, which is more effective and
applicable in practical applications.

4.2.1. Case 1: Normal Operation
A turbine with normal operations between November 2016 and February 2017 was illustrated.
The SCADA data collected in the previous three months (from 1 November, 2016 to 31 January, 2017)
were trained to construct the pitch-motor-temperature model. Afterwards, the feasibility of the model
was tested with the data collected from 1 February, 2017 to 28 February, 2017. The estimated value
of the model and the measured pitch-motor temperature are shown in Figure 3. The R-Squared, root
MSE (RMSE), and MAE were 0.9674, 0.7781 and 0.6007, respectively. These results indicate that the
pitch-motor temperature estimated by the proposed model was close to the actual value. In addition,
the residual errors of the pitch-motor temperature are normally distributed as shown in Figure 4,
which demonstrates that residual errors could be analyzed with the EWMA control chart. In summary,
the regression model works well in the normal operations.

4.2.2. Case 2: Limit-Switch Failure
According to the maintenance record, a turbine was shut down exceptionally at 2:20 on 30 August,
2016. It has found that there was a rag near the limit switch that caused the switch to be stuck. The

fault was cleared at 11:20. The limit switch is responsible for the stroke control and position protection
of pitch operations. Due to the limit-switch fault, the pitch controller received wrong pitch signals,
leading to undesired pitch-control operations. However, there was no alarm or fault detected by the
SCADA system prior to the shutdown.
With the proposed method, the abnormal condition was detected ahead of the shutdown. The
SCADA data collected from 18 August, 2016 to 30 August, 2016 were tested to illustrate the effectiveness
of the model. The model output and the actual temperature during this period are presented in
Figure 5a. It is obviously observed that the actual temperature is higher than the output value in the
later period, which means a pitch-system fault has occurred. Speciﬁcally, the model ﬁrstly detected the
abnormal data at 23:30 on 23 August, 2016 with the moving average approach and the EWMA control
chart. At this time, the EWMA statistic began to exceed the upper control limit as shown in Figure 5b.
Furthermore, it returned to normal at 11:30 on 30 August, 2016 due to maintenance. It indicates that
the proposed method can detect limit-switch failure about six days earlier than the fault occurrence.

A sustained communication alarm of a turbine was given by the SCADA alarm system , which 
started from 3:20 on 22  June, 2017. An inspection was carried out afterwards. It diagnosed that the 
slip ring was damaged. The slip ring is responsible for the communication between the main 
controller and the pitch control ler. Due to the slip -ring fault, the blade pitch angle could not change 
to the optimal value because the pitch actuator did not receive the correct pitch signal. Therefore, 
the turbine almost stopped operation from 22  June, 2017 to 26  June, 2017, which cau sed heavy 
power loss. According to the maintenance record, the slip ring was replaced at 18:20 on 26  June,

The SCADA data collected from 10  June, 2017 to 28  June, 2017 were tested to illustrate the

Additionally, the proposed model is applicable for online CM. According to the results of six
repeated experiments, it costs an average of 420.21 s to ﬁnish the model training, including 10,562 sets
of 10-min averaged SCADA data over a period of three months. Meanwhile, the model-training time
would be longer as the dataset increased. Although it takes a lot of time for training due to the data
preprocessing and parameter optimization, the model could be established in advance, and could be
used directly in the monitoring process. In addition, it could be updated to achieve better performance
with newly collected data after a certain period of time. During the monitoring process, for each
10-min averaged SCADA data collected, the model gives a result on whether there is an outlier. The
computing time is less than 1 s for each sample, which fully satisﬁes the requirement of online CM. In
addition, the computation effect could be improved with better computer conﬁgurations.
5. Conclusions
A data-driven approach for the CM of WT pitch systems using SCADA data has been presented.
The pitch motor temperature was applied to monitor the condition of pitch systems as the status
indicator. Then, a regression model was established to represent the relationship between the
pitch-motor temperature and the selected features in the normal operations, including battery-cabinet
temperature, hub temperature, ambient temperature, pitch-motor current and pitch blade angle, which
were determined based on three feature-selection algorithms. An SVR algorithm was employed to
model the pitch-motor temperature and compared with ﬁve data-driven algorithms, Ridge, Lasso,
kNN, RF, and ANN. As a result, SVR was determined to construct the data-driven model because of
its excellent generalization ability. It was found there is little difference between the model output
and the measured value in the normal operations, and the residual errors are normally distributed.
Therefore, the abnormal monitored temperature indicates a potential pitch-system fault. With the
moving-average approach and the EWMA control chart, the abnormal condition could be identiﬁed
clearly once there are ﬁve residual-based statistics exceed the control limits. The results demonstrate
that pitch-system failures are successfully detected earlier than the SCADA alarm system with the
proposed approach. Moreover, it is more effective and applicable than the classiﬁcation models.
Compared with the knowledge-based method, much professional knowledge and experience are
not needed in this paper. The priori knowledge of physical characteristics for modeling is also not
required compared with the analytical-model-based method. The proposed approach could construct
the regression model automatically with the healthy historical SCADA data. It provides a strategy for
the CM of new WTs. In conclusion, the proposed method is applicable in industrial applications due
to its great adaptive ability and low cost.
This paper only focuses on the CM of WT pitch systems due to a small number of
pitch-system-fault samples. In the SCADA system, various alarms and fault logs are recorded.
However, it is difﬁcult to accurately determine the fault types depending on the SCADA system.
Therefore, an advanced fault-identiﬁcation system should be developed. As a result, further studies
on fault isolation will be summarized in the next research by collecting sufﬁcient fault samples and
investigating the identiﬁcation approaches.
