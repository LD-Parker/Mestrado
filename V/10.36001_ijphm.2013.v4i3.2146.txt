ABSTRACT  
The development of electrical control system faults can lead 
to increased mechanical component degradation, severe 
reduction of asset performance, and a direct increase in 
annual maintenance costs. This paper presents a highly 
accurate data driven classification system for the diagnosis 
of electrical control system faults, in particular, wind turbine 
pitch faults. Early diagnosis of these faults can enable 
operators to move from traditional corrective or time based 
maintenance  policy towards a predictive maintenance 
strategy, whilst simultaneously mitigating risks and 
requiring no further capital expenditure. Our approach 
provides transparent, human -readable rules for maintenance 
operators which have been validated by an independent  
domain expert. Data from 8 wind turbines was collected 
every 10 minutes over a period of 28 months with 10 
attributes utilised to diagnose pitch faults. Thr ee fault 
classes are identified : “no pitch fault ”, “potential pitch fault ” 
and “pitch fault established” . Of the turbines, 4 are used to 
train the system with a further 4 for validation. Repeated 
random sub-sampling of the majority fault class was used to 
reduce computational overheads whilst retaining 
information content and balancing the training and 
validation sets. A classification accuracy of 85.50% was 
achieved with 14 human readable rules generated via the 
RIPPER inductive rule learner. Of these  rules , 11 were 
described as “useful and intuitive” by an independent 
domain -expert. An expert syste m was developed utilising 
the model along with domain knowledge, resulting in a 
pitch fault diagnostic accuracy of 87.05% along with a 
42.12% reduction in pitch fault alarms . 
1. INTRODUCTION  
Maintenance costs for wind energy represent between 20 - 
25% of total asset cost, of which, up to 75% is due to unscheduled maintenance (WWEA, 2012) . This deters 
future investment, increases the cost of wind energy and as 
such, reduces the long term economi c viability of wind 
energy. As corrective maintenance can be up to 40 times 
more expensive than a proactive strategy (Hatch, 2004)  
there is the potential for significant cost savings on wind 
turbine operations and maintenance (O&M) costs. For this 
reason, maintenance is moving from a “fail and fix” reactive 
approach to maintenance, to a “predict and prevent” strategy 
for maintenance (Levrat, et al 2008). Maintenance savings 
of 20 -25% can be achieved using condition based 
maintenance (CBM) (Djurdjanovic, et al 2003) , this is 
echoed by Wu & Clements -Croome (2005) who have shown 
the potential for proactive  maintenance actions to be 
performed at 10 times to 40 times less than respective 
corrective maintenance actions.  However, uptake across all 
domains of prognosti c technologies for the prediction of 
future failure modes has been slower than anticipated. It is 
believed that within the UK, CBM and prognostic 
technologies have only reached 10 -20% penetration into 
industry (Moore & Starr, 2006) . This is believed to be due 
to many factors, such as: the lack of transparency of some 
expert systems, the capital outlay required for data 
collection and analysis, the uncertainty and inaccuracy 
present within some techniques, staff training costs and no 
proven track record in s imilar domains. Whilst strategies 
such as reliability centred maintenance (RCM) can help 
optimise available maintenance resources, the y are  static in 
nature in that they do not take into account the current level 
of asset degradation or external conditions. This  means that 
whilst cost savings can be made through RCM (Niu, et al 
2010) , severe degradation is likely to go unnoticed for 
extended periods, causing secondary damage to auxiliary  
systems, reducing component efficiency and as a result, 
reduce overall retur n on investment for stakeholders. Due to 
as few as 20% of assets failing within the manufacture rs 
prescribed times ( Eti, et al.  2006) , there is a need to move 
away from a static analysis towards a more dynamic, real -
time approach to maintenance.  Currently, maintenance is 
often seen by senior management as a cost minimisation 
exercise, rather than an attempt to maximise benefit (Marais _____________________

2 & Saleh, 2009). This is due to the ease of quantifying the 
cost of maintenance, but not the benefit provided. This 
attitude t owards maintenance means that most efforts to 
reduce annual maintenance expenditure result in a direct 
loss of availability or reduction in the quality of service 
provided (Gomez -Fernandez & Crespo -Marquez, 2009).  
Typically, condition based monitoring is p erformed using 
high frequency data – acoustic emissions and vibration data 
– collected for the remote diagnosis and prognosis of the 
gearbox, generator and main bearing (Crabtree, 2010) . 
However, being able to establish and track the development 
of a fault over longer length s of time through utilising low 
frequency data is interesting as it provides feedback into the 
maintenance planning and scheduling process, enabling the 
optimisation of available resources, thereby reducing annual 
maintenance costs . In this paper we present a new 
methodology for the development of a transparent expert 
system for the detection of wind turbine pitch faults utilising 
a data -intensive machine learning appro ach. This approach 
describes a classifier to determine the current condition of 
the pitch system on a wind turbine through analysis of low 
frequency SCADA data, and if a fault is observed within the 
pitch system, an expert system recommends the correct 
action to take depending upon its severity. Severe pitch 
faults requiring potential maintenance actions can then be 
presented to the maintenance operator whilst filtering out 
unnecessary information and reducing the cognitive load 
which is placed upon them. A s the data utilised for this 
methodology is from a pre -existing SCADA system, no 
further sensors are required and no additional capital 
expenditure is incurred. This mitigates many of the risks 
associated with moving to a proactive maintenance strategy.  
2.  WIND TURBINE PITCH FAULTS  
Wind turbine pitch faults a re deviation of the blade pitch 
angle from a predefined optimum for a given wind speed  
and are the most common fault mode to occur. As can be 
seen in Table 1, pitch faults account for over one third of all 
faults which are present within the SCADA system which 
are then presented to the maintenance operator. It is not 
uncommon for over 2,000 SCADA pitch fault alarms to 
occur over a year. However, less than 5% of these directly 
correlate to a maintenance action w ithin the maintenance 
log; wasting available maintenance resources with undue 
inspection and analysis. As such, there is a need to develop 
a data -driven expert system to allow the encapsulation of the 
behaviours both during and immediately preceding a pitc h 
fault so that maintenance operators can further understand 
the extent of the fault, the causation of the fault and the 
maintenance action required. Accurate identification of 
pitch faults is of particular interest to maintenance operators 
and decision ma kers, as these faults are often the result of 
the electrical control system, and not due to severe physical 
degradation of the pitch motors controlling the wind turbine 
blades. As such, when a pitch fault is identified, the potential exists to remotely res et the turbine pitch system. 
This enables the turbine to return to normal operating 
conditions, without the need for excessive downtime for the 
required inspection. As such the energy generation  can be 
increased, with the potential risk of inc reased degradation 
on auxiliary  components reduced. Should a mechanical fault 
be observed, this will then be diagnosed by the system 
presented in Section 4, enabling the effective scheduling and 
planning of maintenance activities.  
3. RELATED WORK 
Over recent years, interest in improving the efficiency of all 
aspects of the wind turbine life cycle has become of 
paramount importance to ensure a continued  transition to a 
low carbon economy and ending the reliance on fossil fuels. 
As up to 25% of total cost is manifested as maintenance for 
a wind turbine, effective maintenance through condition 
based maintenance and proactive maintenance is essential to 
increasing global investment in wind energy, reducing 
energy prices to consumers and ensuring continued reliable 
operat ion as transitions are made to the smart grid (Massoud 
Amin & Wollenberg, 2005) . Prognosis of the wind turbine 
enables 5 key benefits to be provided to the operator as 
stated in Hameed et al (2009). They are : 
1. The avoidance of premature failures - reducing 
secondary damage to components and also 
reducing catastrophic failures.  
2. A reduction in maintenance costs - by reducing 
catastrophic failures and optimising inspection 
intervals.  
3. The capability of remote diagnosis – essential due 
to the remote nature of offshore turbines . 
4. An increase in generation capacity - prognosis 
enables maintenance to be performed at low wind 
speed to ensure maximal utilisation.  
5. Optimised future designs - large quantities of data 
can be analysed to ensure new generation turbines 
are more reliable.  
Typically, condition monitoring on a wind turbine focuses 
on the high value components; the gearbox, generator and 
main bearing (Crabtree, 2010) . Strong prognostic capability 
is prevalent within the literature. For example, the work 
done by Lin & Zuo (2003)  and Rafiee et al (2010)  use 
wavelet filters to provide condition based maintenance on 
these components. Also , Wang & Makis (2009)  utilise 
statistical methods  (such as autoregressive models)  to 
achieve similar aims. However, these techniques require the 
installation of various additional sensors to each turbine to 
be monitored, which can be costly to the operator. For a full 
review of high frequency techniques, please see the work of 
Jardine et al (2006)  and Hameed et al (2009) . Techniques 
utilising low frequency data, such as SCADA data, do exist.

Work done by Kim et al (2011)  has shown the electrical 
system of a wind turbine is the most prone to establishing a 
fault condition. It has been  shown that low frequency  
SCADA data can be used in conjunction with both PCA and 
self-organising  feature maps for fault classification. 
However, diagnosis to determine the turbine sub-assembly 
at fault is not performed. As such, whilst maintenance 
managers may know a turbine requi res inspection, further 
manual analysis will be required to determine the cause of 
the fault. Chen (2011)  utilises an artificial neural network 
for the automatic analysis of SCADA alarm data. This is 
utilised as a filter to determine which SCADA alarms are  
novel and warrant further analysis. Work done by Kusiak & 
Li (2011)  has shown that a variety of data mining 
approaches (neural networks, ensembles of neural networks, 
the boosting tree algorithm, support vector machines and 
classification and regression t rees) can be used to diagnose 
and prognose irregular wind turbine states. However, even 
when utilising many different data driven approaches, a low 
prognostic horizon (less than an hour) is achieved, and 
accuracy of the classification of fault instances ra nges from 
40% to 71% . 
4. METHODOLOGY  
SCADA data from 8 wind turbines was collected over a 
period of 28 months and sampled every 10 minutes, across 
190 channels. All of these wind turbines had pitch faults 
noted in their hist ories as assessed by their maintenance log 
book. There had been 243 recorded pitch faults across the 
28 months for the 8 turbines, ranging from 6 – 60 pitch 
faults per turbine ( M = 30.38, SD = 16.16) . In total, 999,944 
records were retrieved. This data was  combined with 
SCADA alarm system data and maintenance log data to give 
a holistic overview of the condition of the turbine and so 
that pitch fault events could be analysed. Due to the inherent 
nature of the data acquisition, erroneous and missing values 
are common; these are manifested as implausible values, 
missing data and duplicate data. This is ascribed to 
malfunction of the sensors, mechanical systems, data 
collection systems and also imperfections within the 
SCADA system itself (Sainz, et al 2009) . Due to these 
problems, the data must be cleansed before processing can take place. Both missing and duplicate values were 
removed; missing values cannot accurately describe the 
current state of the wind turbine, and duplicate values 
provide no additional in formation whilst simultaneously 
increasing computational overhead. Once this is complete, 
attribute selection is performed. Based upon the work of 
Chen et al (2011)  and also Kusiak & Verma (2011) , 8 
attributes were selected for their consistently strong 
performance for wind turbine pitch fault diagnosis. Chen et 
al (2011)  presents an artificial neural network (ANN) 
approach to pitch fault diagnosis, however, the diagnosis 
accuracy ( M = 42 .07%; SD = 17.49%) is relatively poor and 
black box nature of the approach is difficult to interpret by 
both domain experts and maintenance operators. Whilst the 
work of Kusiak & Verma (2011)  provides improved 
accuracy for the prediction of wind turbine pitch faults ( M = 
76.70%; SD = 5.62%), the genetic algorithm used provides 
human readable rules which are not necessarily transparent 
(that is, easy to interpret by operators ). As such, the 
attributes chosen for the model based upon the work in the 
literature (Chen et al., 2011 a nd Kusiak & Verma, 2011) 
were:  
 
 Average wind speed  
 Maximum wind speed  
 Blade 1 pitch motor torque maximum  
 Blade 2 pitch motor torque maximum  
 Average pitch motor torque  
 Blade 1 pitch angle average  
 Blade 2 pitch angle average  
 SCADA pitch fault alarm status  
 
In conj unction with these attributes, 2 additional derived 
parameters were utilised based upon the work of Chen et al 
(2011) . These are:  
 
 The absolute difference in torque across pitch 
motors  
 The absolute difference in blade angle position  
 
These attributes were chosen as they fully encapsulate the 
current operating characteristics of the wind turbine pitch 
fault system. The feathering control strategy for variable 
pitch wind turbines is described in detail by Bianchi et al. 
(2006).   For a given wind speed, each blade should be set to 
a pre -determined pitch based upon the strategy employed by 
the individual turbine. The pitch of all the wind turbine 
blades should be identical, and as such, deviations in either 
pitch or torque across the blades can be used to ident ify the 
presence of a pitch fault. The wind speed and SCADA 
alarms status provide additional context to the classifier to 
aid in the classification accuracy.

4 Following this, the data was classified into three distinct 
groups; “No pitch fault”, “ Potential pitch fault ” and “Pitch 
fault established”. These represent the development of a 
fault over time within the wind turbine. By classifying the 
data in this way we can identify both the wind turbines 
which urgently require maintenance and also the turbines 
with a reduced remaining useful life (RUL). Maintenance 
logs were used to determine when pitch faults had been 
severe enough t o warrant a maintenance action.  
 
The SCADA data from the 48 hours preceding this 
maintenance action was used to describe the “Pitch fault 
established” class. The SCADA data prior to this where the 
SCADA -alarm for the pitch fault was active was used to 
describe the “ Potential pitch fault ” class. Finally, all other 
data was used to describe the “no pitch fault” class. Annual 
maintenance  costs can then be reduced utilising this 
classification; either by scheduling further turbines into 
existing maintenance actions, or by pre -emptively 
scheduling those which require maintenance before they 
become inaccessible to external factors. Repeated random 
sampling with 20 samples was utilised to remove the 
majority class bias inherent within the data. As “No pitch 
fault” was the dominant class and the turbine remains in this 
state for a prolonged period, a data -driven classifier would  
be stronger if it encapsulates this class well and ignores the 
pitch faults. However, as the aim of the system is the quality 
of the rules which describe the behaviour of the pitch faults, 
it is essential that this bias is removed so that the minority 
fault classes are e ncapsulated and characterised effectively. 
Within our data, the imbalance was typically between 125 to 
380 instances per fault instance. Whilst other minority 
oversampling techniques could have been used such as 
SMOTE, MSMOTE and FSMOTE (Garcia, et al 2012 ) no 
significant increase in rule accuracy was attained over using 
traditional repeated random sampling within our dataset. As 
such, the majority class was under sampled, and the 
minority class oversampled until the data was balanced. 
After the data had be en pre -processed, the RIPPER 
propositional rule learning algorithm (Cohen & Singer, 
1999) was used to generate order independent, distinct 
encapsulations of explicit knowledge from the dataset. This 
technique was chosen due to its transparent, human -readab le 
nature; ensuring trust was placed in the derived rules. An 
example of rules generated by the RIPPER algorithm can be 
seen in the appendix . Although other techniques such as 
artificial neural networks can achieve high quality 
classifications, their “blac k box” nature makes them 
difficult to extract meaningful rules from. Similarly, 
although techniques such as clustering and instance -based 
classification seem intuitive, the high -dimensionality of the 
dataset and high levels of noise present means that deci sion 
regions are non -convex in nature and neither a high level of 
accuracy nor good quality of rules can be extracted from the system. Decision tree algorithms could have been utilised, 
however, each rule generated cannot be understood 
independently from the system, and as such, can be difficult 
to extract and encapsulate  as a single unit of knowledge.  
4.1. Ripper Algorithm  
The RIPPER algorithm (Cohen, 1995), is an extension to 
the IREP algorithm proposed by Fürnkranz and Widmer 
(1994), utilizing reduced error pruning (REP) used in 
decision tree algorithms. However, where the rule induction 
from decision trees is done in a breadth -first manner (as per 
C4.5), rule induction is performed in a depth -first manner.  
There are two main stages within the ripper algorit hm as 
described by Cohen  (1995) . Firstly, the data is split into 
“growing” and “pruning” dataset, with two thirds typically 
used for growing. This is done by random partitioning of the 
data. After this, rules are grown. This is done by adding 
conditions to  a rule (greedily ) until it is 100% accurate  (that 
is, it covers no negative instance in the growing dataset) . 
This is done by maximizing Foil’s information gain 
criterion  (Quinlan, 1990) : 
                   
            
           (1) 
Where L is the condition to be added to R, t is the number of 
positive instances covered by R+L , p1 and p0 are the number 
of positive instances covered by R and R+L (respectively), 
and n1 and n0 are the number of negative instances covered 
by R and R+L (respectiv ely). This favours rules which have 
high accuracy and cover many positive instances.  
Once the rule has been grown, it is pruned immediately. 
This is done within RIPPER  by considering the removal of 
the final sequence of conditions from the rule that maximi se 
rule value:  
                              
      (2) 
Where p is the number of examples in PrunePos  covered by 
Rule and n is the number of examples in PruneNeg  covered 
by Rule. This is done until no deletion increases the value of 
v* (Cohen, 1999).   
Once the rules have been generated, optimisation is 
performed. In this stage, for each rule which has been grown 
and pruned, two variants are produced ; the replacement and 
the revis ion. The replacement is generated by growing and 
pruning a rule where the pruning stage is guided to 
maximize the accuracy of the entire rule base. The revision 
is generated by greedily adding conditions to the rule. The 
rule with the minimum descriptive l ength (of the original, 
revision or replacement rule) is then chosen for the final rule 
base.  For completeness, the full pseudo -code for the 
RIPPER algorithm (Cohen, 1995) is presented in Figure 1 
(Alpaydin, 2004).

2004).  
4.2. Training and Validation Turbine Selection  
Of the 8 wind turbines, 4 were used for training with the 
remaining turbines used for validation. In order to ensure 
the robustness of the methodology against training turbine 
selection, all combinations of turbines for both training and 
validation were considered. In total, 70 combinations of 
varying training and validation turbines were created. These 
models created a Pareto surface compromising the trade -off 
between the number of rules and rule accuracy which were 
then presented to an independent domain expert . This allows 
for both a quantitative and qualitative analysis of these rules 
so that the causation and diagnosis of pitch faults could 
more  effectively be understood. This enables operators to 
understand the underlying physical properties of pitch faults 
so that they can be trained  or assisted  to identify pitch faults 
before further damage occurs , which may lead to  the turbine being shut down  for corrective maintenance  which is often 
expensive . 
5. RESULTS  
The RIPPER propositional rule learner was trained on 70 
models so that the robustness of the methodology could be 
ensured. Pruning of the rule set was enabled to reduce the 
quantity of rules to prevent potential cognitive overload, and 
was utilized in conjunction with four optimization iterations 
with three  fold partitioning of the data.  
5.1. Robustness to data scarcity  
As can be seen in Table 2, the quantity of data available for 
training influences the accuracy of the system developed 
and also the size of the rule base.  In addition to the analysis 
described in section 4 (on the full dataset), analysis was also 
carried out on 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 months of available 
data to determine the influence of the quantity of data on 
both classification accuracy and size of the rule base.  
Each analysis in Table 2 was performed on the full set of 70 
models generated by choosing each combination of the 8 
training and testing turbines. As such, in total 490 mode ls 
were developed and assessed to analyse the robustness of 
the system to the quantity of training data which was 
available.  
With regards to model accuracy, a Pearson product -moment 
correlation was used to assess the relationship between 
mean classificatio n accuracy attained and the quantity of 
data used.  Preliminary analyses showed this relationship to 
be linear with both variables normally distributed, as 
assessed by Shaprio -Wilk test ( p > .05), and there were no 
outliers. There was a strong positive asso ciation between 
classification accuracy and the quantity of data , r(7) = .91, p 
< .01. This is also the case for maximum classification 
accuracy; r(7) = .91, p < .01, and minimum accuracy 
attained, r(7) = .92, p < .01.  
This shows that there is a strong positive correlation 
between the quantity of data available for training and the 
accuracy of the RIPPER algorithm. As such, it was 
determined that as much data as is available should be 
utilised when performing rule extrac tion. It should be noted 
that the lower bound of classification accuracy increased by 
17.62% from utilising 4 months of data to using the entire 
data set (28 months), whereas the upper bound increased by 
1.68% over the same period. The mean accuracy increa se 
was 3.48% over this period; however, the standard deviation 
of accuracies was reduced by 1.81% in this period. This 
indicates less sensitivity to the selection of wind turbines 
used for testing as more data to be available. This was to be 
expected.  
With regards to the size of the rule base, another Pearson 
product -moment correlation was used to assess the

relationship between mean rule base size and the quantity of 
data used.  Preliminary analyses showed this relationship to 
be linear with both variables normally distributed, as 
assessed by Shaprio -Wilk test ( p > .05), and there were no 
outliers. There was a very strong positive association 
between the size of the rule and the quantity of data, r(7) 
= .99, p < .01. This was also the case for the maximum size 
of the rule base, r(7) = .97, p < .01, and also the case for the 
minimum size of the rule base, r(7) = .97, p < .01.  
This correlation is to be expected based upon the behaviour 
of the RIPPER algorithm. However, due to this, a trade off 
does exist. Increasing the quantity of data available to the 
propositional rule learner would increase the quality of the 
classi fier produced, but would also increase the quantity of 
rules generated for analysis. This is detailed below.  
5.2. Model selection  
Due to the higher mean accuracy and larger rule base 
variance attained by models utilising the full 28 months of 
data, this was cho sen for further analysis. The accuracy of 
the classification for the full data models was in the range of 
69.03% - 87.41% ( M = 80 .77%; SD = 4.68%), with the 
number of rules generated by each model being in the range 
of 6 – 38 (M = 16; SD = 5.77). After removal of the models 
which were dominated by those with stronger classification 
accuracy but the same number of rules, 2 1 models were 
eligible to be presented to an independent domain expert  
and for critical a nalysis of the rules gener ated allowing for 
further understanding of wind turbine pitch fault behaviour . 
The 21 models developed had classification accuracy in the 
range of 69.99% - 87.41% ( M = 82 .70%; SD = 4.26%). 
Similarly, the quantity of rules generated were in the range 
of 6 – 38 (M = 16.5, SD = 7.65). A Pearson product -moment 
correlation was used to assess the relationship between 
classification accuracy and the number of rules generated by 
the model. Preliminary analyses showed the relationship to 
be linear with both variables normally distributed, as assessed by Shaprio -Wilk test ( p > .05), and t here were no 
outliers. There was no association between classification 
accuracy and the number of rules present, r(21) = .056, p 
> .05. This can clearly be seen in Figure 2. As such, it is 
beneficial to maintenance operators and decision makers 
that a smaller set of rules are analysed and understood. This 
enables a holistic understanding of the underlying behaviour 
and development of wind turbine pitch faults whilst 
reducing cognitive load and whilst providing comparable 
classification accuracy to the model s with a larger rule base . 
Within the model selected, 14 rules were generated leading 
to an overall classification accuracy of 85.50%. For 
completeness, the knowledge base determined by the 
RIPPER algorithm has been included in the appendix. It can 
be noted that although a high classification accuracy has 
been attained in this model, it is still difficult to differentiate 
between no pitch fault existing and a pitch fault being 
present, with expert analysis required to certify 
classifications.  
As can be seen  in Table 3, the Matthews Correlation 
Coefficient (MCC) (Matthews, 1975)  for all classes is 
strong, showing high correlation between the learnt rules 
and the validation data. A substantial  level of agreement 
was found between the developed model and the va lidation 
data (Cohen’s k = 0.78; p < .05). After deriving the 
classification, the 14 rules were presented to  an independent 
domain expert  so that qualitative and quantitative analysis 
could be performed. Due to the min -max normalization 
process during pre-processing, values had to be converted 
back to ensure they were human readable. Once this had 
been done, a full analysis was performed.

6. EVALUATION AND EXPLOI TATION OF GENERATED 
RULES  
Due to the size of the knowledge base, it was practical to 
have the domain expert evaluate each rule individually. This 
is done as the expert can provide a context sensitive ground 
truth to the analysis, along with experience of situations and 
conditions w hich may not have been present within the 
training data. As domain experts have subjective opinions 
with regards to what constitutes interesting, novel and 
important, it is difficult to quantify these characteristics.  
However, various artefacts  are present  within the rule -base 
which is expected given the nature of the classification. To 
assess the quality of the rules, a 56 - item questionnaire was 
presented to an independent domain expert who has over 6 
years wind turbine diagnostic and prognostic experienc e 
within academia. This questionnaire contained a 5 -point 
Likert response scale ranging from 1 (Not intuitive, useful, 
clear or interesting) to 5 (Highly intuitive, useful, clear or 
interesting). There were 4 questions presented per rule 
generated from the  model, assessing whether or not the rule 
was intuitive,  useful, clear and interesting  
The results of this analysis can be seen in Table 4. As can be 
seen in Table 4, an average  response of 2.89 was recorded; 
indicating that the rules are typically not par ticularly 
intuitive, clear, useful or interesting. This was unexpected. 
Rules were often regarded as just as useful ( M = 2.79) as 
intuitive ( M = 2.71). This is likely due to the nature of the 
complex nature of the underlying pitch faults. By having the 
independent domain expert dr ive the discussion it was found  
that of the 14 rules, 11 of the rules were deemed 
“interesting” and warranted further analysis.  
After performing this analysis, the independent domain 
expert was then presented with a further 13 rules, taken 
from the work of Kusiak & Verma (2011) . To remove 
potential bias, the expert was not informed of the  origin of 
either set of rules. A 52 -item questionnaire was used 
containing a 5 -point Likert scale from 1 (Not intuitive, 
useful, clear or interesting) to 5 (Highly intuitive, useful, 
clear or interesting). This was to provide an objective 
analysis of the intuitiveness, usefulness, clearness and 
interestingness.  
Initially, the expert could not understand the rules due to 
their format and abstract  nature, however, after some time, 
analysis could be performed. The comparative analysis 
showed that whilst the rules were found to be less intuitive 
(M = 1.53; SD = 0.63) and clear ( M = 1.46; SD = 0.49), they were still regarded as somewhat useful ( M = 2.23; SD = 
0.79) and interesting ( M = 2.07; SD = 0.61). When 
questioned regarding this, the expert responded that as long 
as the rules were accurate and accountable, they could be 
disseminated at a later date. As such, it was determined that 
an expert sy stem should be developed to aid maintenance 
operators with enquiries and to handle the large quantities of 
data present within the system.  
6.1. Rule sensitivity to wind turbine location  
As different geographical locations have inherently distinct 
operating conditions, it is expected that the accuracy of the 
expert system would be reduced when applying the rules to 
similar wind turbines in a different location. As such, a new 
expert system would have to be developed for each wind 
farm as described by the meth odology described in Section 
4. In order to assess the impact of the geographical location 
on the accuracy of the rules, data was collected from an 
additional turbine in the same manner as the previous 
turbines and was located at a different wind farm with in the 
same country . The wind turbine also had 28 months of 
SCADA data available, with 3 pitch faults recorded in the 
historical maintenance log. This wind farm  was subject to 
different external conditions due to being located in a 
different region.  
Valida tion of the selected model on this additional wind 
turbine yielded a classification accuracy of 6 8.68% ; 
somewhat lower than the 85.50% accuracy of the original 
model. The model was able to identify 2 of the 3 pitch faults 
which had been recorded in the mai ntenance log; giving a 
diagnostic accuracy of 66.67%.

against the number of rules generated in each model. No 
strong correlation existed ( r(21) = 0.06, p > .05).

8 7. EXPERT SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT  
Due to the strong classification gained from the model, an 
expert system was developed to aid maintenance managers 
and decision makers so that available resources could be 
optimized. Due to the often inaccessible nature of offshore 
wind turbines, predicting failu res can significantly reduce 
operations and maintenance (OM) costs, thereby increasing 
the competitive nature of wind energy. The model 
developed in Section 4 was combined with domain 
knowledge (meta -data) elicited from the independent 
domain expert to red uce the high dimensionality of the 
SCADA data and provide filtering . This was d one so that 
the maintenance operator did not have to analyse 190 
channels of data coming from over 40 wind turb ines per 
farm, every 10 minutes. In order to assist the operator or 
decision make r in their role, the expert system must aid their 
ability to perform analysis and make decisions based upon 
relevant information. These decisions become more difficult 
due to various stressors which exist in the working 
environment. Kontogiannis & Kossiave lou (1999) identify 
these stressors as:  
• Environmental stressors:  
o Noise  
o Temperature  
o Vibrations  
• Task complexity stressors:  
o Time Pressure  
o Workload  
o Uncertainty  
o Threat/High error consequences  
o Negative feedback  
• Group and organisational stressors:  
o Occupational stress  
o Shift/continuous work  
o Lack of team cohesion  
o Communication problems  
 
Due to the nature of the domain, the expert system aims to 
reduce task complexity stressors. Specifically, reducing time 
pressure by providing automated analysis and reducing 
worklo ad by reducing the initial quantity of information 
presented to the operator per wind turbine. The expert stated 
that typically, SCADA -alarms for pitch fault are noisy, and 
only when constant irregularities are noticed over an 
extended period, is maintenan ce considered on the turbine . 
 
This is typically due to imperfections within the SCADA 
system itself causing duplicate, missing and implausible 
values to be recorded (Sainz, et al 2009). Also, as SCADA 
data quickly accumulates to create large and unmanagea ble 
volumes of data, attempts to deduce the current state of a 
wind turbine can be severely hindered (Zaher, et al 2009), it 
is therefore essential that this data can be adequately filtered 
in an automated manner.  Question  N M SD

Table 4 . Independent domain expert evaluation.  
As such, based upon the expert -knowledge, a threshold was 
set that should either the “ Potential pitch fault ” or “Pitch 
fault established” classification be active for over 90 
minutes, an alert would be sent to the maintenance operator. 
90 minutes was deemed by the expert to be the minimum 
length of time an alarm was active before action would be 
taken and was used as a filter to reduce the n oise of the 
SCADA system. Lower values would increase the noise 
within the expert system whereas higher values may miss 
the potential development of pitch faults. This, therefore, 
reduces the quantity of SCADA alarms presented to the 
maintenance operator, whilst still presenting those which 
warranted further investigation.  
This reduces the potential cognitive overload of the 
maintenance operator, allowing for their analysis to be 
focused on the wind turbines which are current exhibiting 
potential pitch fault state. This optimises the available 
maintenance resources by reduci ng the time spent analys ing 
large quantities of false -positive alarms provided from 
SCADA system. With regards to the imperfections within 
the SCADA system, a threshold was also set for missing 
and implausible values. As missing data cannot fully 
encapsulat e the current operating condition of the wind 
turbine, it would be difficult to establish if the fault was 
caused by either a mechanical fault on the turbine, an 
electrical fault on the turbine or an electrical fault on the 
SCADA system. As such, 90 minute s of continuous 
operation in this state provides an alert to the maintenance 
operator, as above. A similar strategy is employed for 
implausible data, with expert defined maximum and 
minimum values for each attribute. Should a single attribute 
fall outside of this pre -defined range for a full 90 minutes, 
the operator is also alerted to this.  
It should also be noted that one of the alarms on a separate 
turbine (outside of the training and test data) was active for 
over 100 days continually. Clearly this is un desirable and 
hinders the efforts of maintenance managers and decision 
makers to correctly diagnose and both plan and schedule 
maintenance.  
As such, the ability to correctly filter and classify SCADA -
data so that the false -positive instances such as this d o not 
occur is essential. In the best case , these false -positive 
instances  are simply a minor hindrance and require further 
manual analysis by the maintenance operator to determine if 
a turbine warrants inspection. In the worst case, they 
provide a basis fo r maintenance actions which may not be 
required. In an offshore situation, these un -necessary 
maintenance actions can be expensive due to the equipment

8. EVALUATION OF EXPERT SYSTEM  
In order to assess the validity of the expert system 
developed, historical SCADA -data from 4 wind turbines 
was used to determine the number of maintenance alerts 
issued in comparison to the on-board  SCADA -alarm 
system. The validation turbines were independent of those 
used within the training model, and were located in the same 
geographical location as the turbines used for the model 
development and training.  
As can be seen in Table 5, in each of the 4 wind turbines 
analysed, a reduction in the number of alarms generated was 
observed compared to the turbines integrated SCADA alarm 
system. This was between 35.80% - 52.26% ( M = 44.69%; 
SD = 6.62%), effectively reducing the workload of the 
maintenance operator when analysing  data to diagnose 
potential pitch faults. Similarly, this was the case for active 
alarm time; the reduction was between 28.06% - 49.90% ( M 
= 35.68%; SD = 8.60%). This, again, reduces the quantity of 
information the maintenance operator has to manage. It is 
worth noting that although 85 pitch maintenance actions 
were undertaken over the 28 month period in which this 
historical data was analysed, 11 of these maintenance 
actions were not detected by the expert system. This is 
mainly due to malfunction of the sensors, mechanical 
systems, and the data collection systems; Of the 11 
instances, 7 occurred when data acquisition  failed for an 
extended period. Due to the design of t he expert system, 
missing data does not fully encapsulate the correct turbine 
condition, and as such, the accuracy is significantly reduced. 
It is believed that the remaining 4 cases are partly due to 
time-based preventive maintenance which may not have ha d 
sufficient basis for action based upon the observed SCADA -
data 
9. CONCLUSIONS  
In this paper we have presented a robust, accurate expert 
system for the classification and detection of wind turbine 
pitch faults, as validated by the 85.50% classification 
accur acy achieved. Transparent, human readable rules were 
extracted, analysed and verified by an independent domain 
expert enabling trust in the expert system one of the key 
barriers to wide scale adoption of CBM technology. These rules were found to be more in tuitive than other rules within 
the literature, and provided the basis for an expert system to 
aid maintenance operators and decision makers.  The number 
of SCADA alarms was reduced by an average of 44.68%, 
with a mean reduction of active alarm time by 35.6 8%. The 
developed expert system reduced the potential cognitive 
load on maintenance operators and decision makers by 
significantly reducing the number of alarms presented to 
them. This frees maintenance resources, enabling a 
reduction in annual maintenance  costs whilst retaining an 
equal quality of service. Additionally, no further capital 
expenditure was necessary due to using pre -existing 
technological capability.  A diagnostic accuracy of 87.05% is 
achieved in the system, although it is believed that this  
could be further increased should more reliable sensor 
technology become available. Our methodology provided a 
robust strategy to classify SCADA  data as having no pitch 
fault, an established pitch fault or a potential  pitch fault. 
This provides a means t o both condition based maintenance 
and proactive maintenance strategies. By performing remote 
diagnosis through the expert system, the opportunity for 
remote maintenance arises due to the nature of the electrical 
system. In some cases, resetting the contro l system remedies 
the existing electrical fault, increasing availability whilst 
reducing unnecessary maintenance inspections and 
mitigating the associated costs. By understanding the 
severity of the fault through the expert system classification, 
maintenan ce managers can make informed decisions 
regarding the most appropriate course of action.  
Future work will look to utilise statistical techniques to 
reduce the quantity of data required for accurate 
classification. Whilst 4 months of data provided an averag e 
classification of 77.29%, had no historical pitch fault data 
been available, the expert system would not have been able 
to encapsulate the pitch fault behaviour and would not be fit 
for purpose. Thus, the expert system would not be effective. 
As such, th e use of suspension histories to classify normal 
operating behaviour through utilising  robust statistical 
methods would be more appropriate  in these circumstances . 
This would remove the need for fault data present within the 
training data, providing a stra tegy for the prognosis and 
diagnosis of new wind turbines.
