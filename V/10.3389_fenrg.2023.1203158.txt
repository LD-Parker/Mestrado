In large-scale wind turbines, the force state of the pitch system greatly in ﬂuences safe
operation and service life. This paper provi des a novel method to estimate blade pitch
load, bearing friction torque, and motor pitch torque. In this method, the forceequilibrium equations are established by i nvestigating the force of the pitch system
under multiple operating conditions. The multidimensional BIN method is employed
to classify the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data of wind turbinesinto several intervals. The multidimensional scatter data is processed in a single-valuedway. Then, the estimating model of the pitch system forces is established bycombining the obtained data and the equilibrium equations. Taking a 2 MW wind
turbine as an example, the variation characte ristics of blade pitch load, bearing friction
torque, and motor pitch torque under multiple operating conditions are analyzed.Some interesting and valuable conclusions are obtained. For example, when the wind
speed increases, the blade pitch load increases signi ﬁcantly in the maximum wind
energy tracking region, but there is no obvious change in the observed constantpower output region. The wind speed and azimuth have little effect on the bearingfriction torque. The variation trend of motor pitch torque is consistent with that ofblade pitch load in the maximum wind energy tracking region.

1 Introduction
Wind energy is renewable energy with the prospect of large-scale development. The
research and development (R&D), installation, and operation of large wind turbines arebooming all over the world. Optimizing the design and operation of large wind turbines has
become a hot issue in the industry. The pitch system is one of the key components of large-
scale wind turbines ( Rosemeier et al., 2016 ). During the operation of wind turbines, the pitch
system bears complex loads and has multiple working conditions, which causes frequentfailures ( Dai et al., 2022 ), for example, the pitch brake failure and the pitch bearing breakage
(He et al., 2021 ;Li and Wang, 2021 ). Relevant statistical data show that the failures of pitch
systems account for more than 40% of all wind turbine failures, resulting in more than 30%of wind turbine downtime ( Bi et al., 2014 ). The failure of the pitch control system is closely
related to its force state. However, in the process of wind turbine operation, the force state of
the pitch system is very complex, and it is dif ﬁcult to measure with sensors. Obtaining a clear
understanding of the force state of the pitch system will be bene ﬁcial to the design, operation,
and maintenance of wind turbines.OPEN ACCESS

Recently, the force state of the pitch system has received
considerable attention in academic and engineering circles. A lotof relevant theoretical research works have been carried out. Dai et al.deduced the blade pitch load expression considering theaerodynamics, centrifugal force, and gravity ( Dai et al., 2010 ;Dai
et al., 2011 ). Liu et al. applied the Fourier transform formula to
calculate the gear meshing stress ( Liu et al., 2019 ). There are also some
studies to improve the force through control. Xu et al. used theimproved fuzzy proportional control strategy to reduce the ultimateload at the blade root ( Xu et al., 2020 ). Jiao et al. designed a novel
adaptive pitch controller to predict the aerodynamic load of windturbines ( Jiao et al., 2018 ). Abdelbaky et al. established a nonlinear
mathematical model to achieve optimal control based on the MPC(Abdelbaky et al., 2020 ). Yuan et al. adopted a robust multivariate
pitch strategy to analyze periodic variations of blade load ( Yuan et al.,
2020). Some studies are also carried out through experiments and
simulation ( Wang and Chiang, 2016 ;Cheon et al., 2019 ;Wang et al.,
2019). Despite these research works, the actual force state of the wind
turbine pitch system has not been completely determined. This isbecause large wind turbines are installed and debugged on-site, andthe actual performance can only be obtained after operation. Thepitch system includes blade, pitch bearing, pitch gearbox, pitch drive
motor, and other components. So, the blade pitch load, bearing
friction torque, and motor pitch torque can only be obtainedthrough the analysis of on-site operation data. At present, the on-site SCADA data of wind turbines are widely used, mainly forperformance analysis, condition evaluation, and fault diagnosis(Chen et al., 2013 ). For example, Zeng et al. quantitatively
described the oil tank temperature of wind turbine gearboxesbased on SCADA data ( Zeng et al., 2022 ). Astol ﬁconducted
support vector regression analysis for power monitoring based on
SCADA data ( Astol ﬁ,2 0 2 1 ). Wei et al. established a wind turbine
aging evaluation model based on SCADA data by introducing fouraging evaluation indicators ( Wei et al., 2021 ). Neshat et al. estimated
the power output of Swedish onshore wind turbines by optimizing thehistorical SCADA data ( Neshat et al., 2021 ). Bhargava et al. analyzed
the aerodynamic load of a 2.1 MW wind turbine based on bladeelement momentum (BEM) and SCADA data ( Bhargava et al., 2020 ).
Wei et al. detected faults in encoders and pitch motors based on an
improved RVM neural network algorithm and SCADA data ( Wei
et al., 2020 ). McKinnon et al. used the isolated forest machine learning
method to process SCADA data for pitch system fault predicting(McKinnon et al., 2021 ). Korkos et al. used ANFIS technology to
analyze 10-year SCADA data and established a fault detection modelfor the pitch system ( Korkos et al., 2022 ). Correa-Jullian et al.
employed a quantum kernel classi ﬁcation method to detect faults
in the pitch system ( Correa-Jullian et al., 2022 ). Yin et al. detected
high-temperature faults of the pitch motor by using the ensemblelearning-based method ( Yin et al., 2022 ).
In theory, the SCADA data includes wind speed, rotational speed,
power, pitch angle, pitch motor c urrent, and other information,
covering various working conditio ns of wind turbines. Therefore, it
is a new idea to reconstruct the pitch system load from SCADA data.How to establish a connection bet ween SCADA data and pitch load is
the key to solve this problem. A simple analysis of SCADA data is also
not feasible, and it needs to be combined with the physical model of thepitch system. On the other hand, SCADA data contains a lot of noisedata, so how to preprocess the data is also an important issue. Startingfrom these scenarios, this paper creat ively proposes solutions, and the
main contributions are as follows.
All the blade pitch load, bearing friction torque, and motor
pitch torque are investigated.
The force equilibrium equations of the blade are
established.
The multidimensional BIN method is employed to preprocess
SCADA data.
The estimating model of the pitch system forces is established.
The variation characteristics of pitch load under multiple
operating conditions are analyzed.
The remaining part is organized as follows. In Section 2 , the
theoretical analysis of the forces acting on the pitch system is carried
out, including the theoretical forces analysis of the pitch system andthe force equilibrium equations. In Section 3 , the force estimation
model of the pitch system is established, including SCADA datapreparation, use of the multidimensional BIN method, and forceestimation model of the pitch system. The force characteristicinvestigation of the pitch system based on SCADA data is showninSection 4 . In this section, all the blade pitch load, bearing friction
torque, and motor pitch torque are investigated. Finally, Section 5
ends the paper by summarizing the main achievements.

on pitch system

to the drive gear. The drive gear engages with the inner gear ring, and
the blade is bolted onto the inner gear ring. When the pitch
controller gives a pitch control command, the pitch motor willproduce output torque. It passes through the transmission shaft andreduction mechanism and ﬁnally, through the drive gear ato the
inner gear ring b. The rotation of the inner gear ring will drive the
blades connected to it to rotate together, thus changing the bladepitch angle.
The forces acting on the pitch system are very complex. Here,
three main forces that affect the behavior of the pitch system are
discussed, namely, motor pitch torque ( T
a), blade pitch load ( Tb),
and bearing friction torque ( Tf). The blade pitch load plays a key
role in the force distribution of the pitch system because its changewill change other force states. Generally speaking, blade pitch load isaffected by three aspects ( Dai et al., 2010 ;Liu et al., 2021 ), namely,
the gravity acting on the blade, the centrifugal force acting on theblade caused by the rotation of the wind rotor, and the aerodynamic
force acting on the blade. More speci ﬁcally, the gravity acting on the
blade is determined by the mass distribution of the blade. Thedirection of gravity is always vertical and downward. It should benoted that the direction of gravity is different from the direction ofblade pitch load caused by gravity. Here, the blade pitch load isanalyzed from the angle of torque, which means that its direction isrelated to the position of the pitch axis. The centrifugal force isrelated to blade mass distribution and rotor speed, and its direction
is the radial direction of the rotor. The aerodynamic force is related
to wind speed, airfoil and size, blade pitch angle, etc. There are twomain aspects of blade movement. One is synchronous rotation withthe main shaft of the wind rotor, and the other is rotation around thepitch axis. When the blade rotates with the main shaft in space, theblade pitch load will also change with the space position.
In SCADA data, motor pitch torque, blade pitch load, and
bearing friction torque are not directly recorded. However, the
current of the pitch motor is collected and stored at all times.
This provides the possibility for indirect calculation of motor pitchtorque. Neglecting the motor ’s empty torque T
0and inertial torque,
the motor pitch torque can be expressed as ( Zhang et al., 2019 )Ta/equalsi1i2ηsIaTN/slashbigIN (1)
where, Tais motor pitch torque, TNis rated torque of pitch motor,
INis rated current of pitch motor, Iais pitch motor current, i1is the
transmission ratio of the planetary gear reducer, i2the transmission
ratio from the drive gear to the inner gear ring, and ηsis the
mechanical ef ﬁciency of the pitch transmission system. It can be
seen that the current data extracted from the SCADA data can be
effectively used to calculate the motor torque which drives the blade
to rotate at the corresponding moment.
2.2 Force equilibrium equations
Maximum wind energy tracking region
When the wind speed is greater than the cut-in wind speed and
less than the rated wind speed, wind turbines usually capture thewind energy to output electric energy under the condition of aconstant pitch angle. In this region, wind turbines are expected tomaximize the use of wind energy, which is called the maximum windenergy tracking region. Since the pitch angle is constant, the bearingfriction torque is static friction torque. Then, motor pitch torque T
a,
blade pitch load Tb, and bearing friction torque Tfact together to
maintain the dynamic balance of the blade pitch system. In this
scenario, the magnitude and direction of the bearing friction torqueare time-varying and will change with the change of blade pitch loadand motor pitch torque. The expression between the three can bewritten as
T
a−Tb±Tf/equals0( 2 )
If the in ﬂuence of bearing friction moment is ignored, the blade
pitch load can be calculated from the motor pitch torque in themaximum wind energy tracking region.
Constant power output region
When the wind turbine runs in the constant power output
region, the wind speed reaches or exceeds the rated wind speed, andthe blade pitch angle is controlled by feedback. In this region, thewind speed may remain constant at some time, which means that thepitch angle is also constant. Then, the mechanical equilibrium
equation is also written as
T
a−Tb±Tf/equals0( 3 )
In the constant power output region, if the wind speed continues
to decrease, the blade pitch angle will be driven to decrease to
increase the windward area, which is called the open-pitch state, as
shown in Figure 2 . Motor pitch torque Taovercomes both blade
pitch load Tband bearing friction torque Tf, which makes the blade
rotate, and blade forces can be described as
Ta−Tb−Tf/equals0( 4 )
When wind speed tends to increase, the blade pitch angle turns
in the direction of becoming larger to reduce the windward area,which is called the smooth-pitch state, as shown in Figure 3 . Blade
pitch load T
bovercomes both motor pitch torque Taand bearing
FIGURE 2

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
friction torque Tf, which makes the blade rotate, and blade forces
can be described as
Tb−Ta−Tf/equals0( 5 )
When operating in the constant power output region, the blade
rotation direction is different when the blade is in the open-pitchand smooth-pitch state, and the motor pitch torque is different. Ifthe blades have the same windward surface and aerodynamic force,the blade pitch load and bearing friction moment are the same
regardless of the rotation dir ection. Therefore, from Eqs 1,3,i ti s
easy to obtain blade pitch load when the pitch system is at astandstill state in the constant power output region. Combinedwith Eqs 4,5the blade pitch load and bearing friction torque can be
obtained from the motor pitch torqu ew h e nt h eb l a d ei si nt h es t a t e
of open-pitch and smooth-pitch. In other words, the blade pitch
load and bearing friction torque can be calculated from the motorpitch torque in the constant power output region. It must be
pointed out that in the process of blade movement, there is inertia
force generated by acceleration start and decelerationstop. Considering that the blade is a large inertia body, in order
to minimize the dynamic load of the pitch system, the bladeangular acceleration is controlled below 0 .01rad/ s
2.T h e
resulting inertia moment is smaller than the motor pitchmoment, so the in ﬂuence of the blade rotational inertia
moment is ignored in the force state analysis.
For a certain wind turbine, its rotor hub structure, blade
geometry and its mass distribution, and blade aerodynamiccharacteristics are unchanged. If the in ﬂuence of wind direction,
yaw, and other factors is not considered, the blade pitch loaddepends on wind speed, rotor speed, blade azimuth, and pitchangle. When the wind turbine is in the maximum wind energytracking region, the wind speed is lower than the rated wind speed,the blade will not be started to pitch, and the pitch angle remains
unchanged. By controlling rotor speed ω/equalsλ
optv/R, the blade tip
speed ratio λis close to the optimum value so that the wind energy
utilization coef ﬁcient (power coef ﬁcient) Cpand the output power
reach the maximum, that is, it is in the maximum wind energytracking region. When the wind turbine is in the constant power
output region, wind speed reaches or exceeds the rated wind speed,and rotor speed remains at the rated speed. At this time, to suppressthe impact of wind speed changes on the output power, the controlsystem will issue a pitch command, that is, by controlling the bladepitch angle β. When the wind speed increases, the pitch angle
increases; when the wind speed decreases, the pitch angle
decreases, which keeps the output power constant and obtainsconstant power output. Therefore, blade pitch load actually onlydepends on wind speed and blade azimuth.

3.1 Data preparation
In the raw SCADA data, even though it is standard operating
state data, it will have both null and zero values because of theinﬂuence of external interference in the sensing test and the
communication transmission process. The raw ﬁeld data must be
processed, including outlier elimination, null value supplement, etc.
These works are collectively referred to as data preprocessing
(Zhang et al., 2019 ).
After processing the raw SCADA data of wind turbines, wind
speed, rotor speed, blade azimuth (hub angle), output power, pitchmotor current, pitch angle, and other wind turbine state data areextracted. If the number of wind turbine state parameters is n, one
sampling record constitutes a data sample, as follows

Since the data is sampled and recorded at a ﬁxed frequency,
each time corresponds to a particular moment. If the samplingfrequency is set to f(Hz), then the isample record is the moment

samples extracted is m, the data can be expressed in matrix form.

3.2 Multidimensional BIN method
Due to many SCADA data samples, it is dif ﬁcult to observe
the relationship between parameters from the raw data scatterplots. Figure 4 s h o w sas c a t t e rp l o to ft he relationship between
motor pitch torque and wind speed obtained from SCADA rawdata. It can be seen from the ﬁgure that the change in motor pitch
torque is very complex, predom inantly when the wind turbine
operates in an area with high wind speed. Moreover, since thewind speed dimension of SCADA raw data is m/s, and onedecimal place is reserved, it i s inevitable that the same wind
speed value corresponds to multiple motor pitch moments, ass h o w ni nt h es m a l l ﬁg u r e .T h e r e f o r e ,i nS C A D Ad a t aa n a l y s i s ,t h e
BIN method is usually used to simplify the processing, ﬁnd out
the relationship between para meters, and then put forward a
mathematical model re ﬂecting the relationship.
The BIN method is to divide a parameter range into the data
set into several small intervals. Then, the relevant parameters ofeach small interval data sample are statistically analyzed, and thestatistical average value of each p arameter is taken as the relevant
parameter value of the new sample (small interval). In this way,the relatively stable relationship between parameters can be moreclearly observed and obtained by analyzing these new samples
with a small number. In essence, the BIN method is a smoothing
method to eliminate noise and average ﬁltering to obtain a
simpler and single-valued parameter relationship whileignoring the in ﬂuence of parameter changes between small
intervals.
Taking the relationship between wind speed and motor pitch
torque as an example, wind speed is an independent variable, andmotor pitch torque is a dependent variable. The wind speeddistribution range or value ra nge obtained from SCADA data is
[v
min,vmax]. By using the BIN method, the wind speed range is
divided into m intervals, and the interval width is(v
max −vmin)/m. The number of samples in the kth interval is
Nk, and the samples in this range are counted to obtain the
average value of wind speed and motor pitch torque, which is
used as a new sample, namely,

⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩k/equals1,...,m (11)
To obtain more stable results, the abnormal samples can also
be eliminated according to the PauTa criterion, and then theaverage value of the new sample parameters can be recalculated
using Eq. 11. In fact, the SCADA data samples are very large, and
some so-called abnormal samples have little impact on thestatistical mean value. Generally, abnormal samples are notremoved. Moreover, because the d ata sample is very large, it is
assumed that the wind speed in each small interval isapproximately uniformly distributed. Thus, Eq. 11 is
simpli ﬁed to

Subsequently, the BIN method used above to analyze the
effects of a single parameter is extended to a multidimensional
space. The multidimensional BIN method is applied to analyzeproblems with complex effects of multiple parameters. Firstly,
these parameters are divided into small intervals within theirvalue domain at certain interval s, ignoring parameter effects
within each small interval. Then, the small interval BINmethod is used for statistical analysis of the concernedparameters in their intervals. At this time, other parameters
are within a ﬁxed range, which means that other parameters
remain unchanged. Finally, the sm a l li n t e r v a lB I Nm e t h o dc a nb e
used for statistical analysis of all parameters in their intervals toobtain the in ﬂuence rules of these parameters. To put it vividly,
this is to mine a small multidim ensional space from a large
multidimensional data sample space composed of multipleparameters and carry out statistical analysis on the datasamples existing in this small mu ltidimensional space. Then,
according to the research purpose, the BIN method can be carried
out on the concerned parameters to obtain the in ﬂuence and
relationship of the concerne d parameters, as shown in Figure 5 .

3.3 Force estimation model of pitch system
The generation process of wind turbines consists of two
operating zones: the maximum wind energy tracking regionand the constant power output region. Therefore, the pitchsystem has two stages: constant pitch and variable pitch. Inaddition, with the change of wind speed, the pitch stage hasthree states: smooth-pitch state, open-pitch state, and standstill
state. Therefore, corresponding to the generation process of wind
turbines, the pitch system exists in four different states: entire
constant pitch state, smooth-pitch state, open-pitch state, andstandstill state. As mentioned b efore, the force equilibrium
equations of the blade are different for each state. Therefore,the force analysis of the pitch system based on ﬁeld SCADA data
should ﬁrst obtain the data subset c orresponding to the four
states, that is, the SCADA data set should be decomposed.
The pitch system ’s operating state is essentially the blade ’s
rotating state. According to the size and direction of the blade
pitch angle, the running state of the pitch system can bedetermined. Because of the installation and test errors of windturbines and the disturbance caused by the dynamiccharacteristics of wind ene rgy and wind turbines, in the
SCADA data, even when the wind speed is low, and the pitchsystem does not change, the pitch angle is not 0
°but has a certain
initial value of βth. Thus, for convenience, βi≤βthis deﬁned as the
constant pitch state and βi>βthas the pitch state. Considering the
pitch angle dynamic perturbation, the pitch speed threshold is settoς
th. From this scenario, t h ef o l l o w i n ga r ed e ﬁned respectively:ςi>ςthis the smooth-pitch state, ςi≤−ςthis the open-pitch state,
and −ςth<ςi≤ςthis the standstill state.

In this way, the data sample set is decomposed into four subsets
of state data. According to the four state data subsets, the blade pitch
load, bearing friction torque, and motor pitch torque of the four
states of the variable pitch system can be obtained respectively byusing the multidimensional BIN method and based on the previousforce equilibrium equation.
In the constant pitch state, th e corresponding wind turbine
operation is in the maximum wind energy tracking region.According to the value range of wind speed and azimuth, it isdivided into m and n intervals, and then the sample set D

When the pitch system is in the s mooth-pitch or open-pitch

In this way, the blade pitch load and bearing friction torque
during wind turbine operation can be estimated from the motorpitch torque obtained in Eq. 1, which also facilitates the analysis of
the effect of wind speed and blade azimuth on the motor pitchtorque, blade pitch load, and bearing friction torque.
3.4 Analysis process of force estimation of
pitch system
When estimating and analyzing the forces acting on the pitch
system, ﬁrst of all, it is necessary to clarify the research object and
establish the force equilibrium equation of the wind turbine pitchsystem under various operating conditions. Then, the
multidimensional BIN method is applied to estimate the blade
pitch load, bearing friction torque, and motor pitch torque at thecorresponding moment based on the ﬁeld SCADA data. Finally,
using wind speed and azimuth as in ﬂuencing factors, the
variation of blade pitch load, bearing friction torque, andmotor pitch torque in four states, including constant pitchstate in the maximum wind energy tracking region, andsmooth-pitch, standstill and open-pitch state in the constant
power output region, are analyzed. The speci ﬁc analysis process
is shown in Figure 6 .

4 Force characteristic investigation of
the pitch system
4.1 Data observation and parameter setting
An entire year SCADA data of a 2 MW wind turbine are
collected to conduct the research. The wind turbine locates at amountainous wind farm in southern China. The technicalperformance parameters of the wind turbine and the pitchsystem are shown in Table 1 (Zhang et al., 2019 ). The SCADA
system stores the operation parameters with an interval of 1 s(sampling frequency is 1 Hz). Table 2 shows the raw SCADA
data form of the SCADA system. From the SCADA system, theoperating parameters of the wind turbine are extracted for
subsequent investigation, such as wind speed, rotor speed, blade
azimuth, output power, pitch motor current, pitch motor power,and pitch angle. Considering the symmetry of the wind turbine, onlyone of the three blades is selected for analysis.

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
The pitch angle of the extracted parameters is obtained by the
angle sensor installed near the inside of the blade inner gear ring.The pitch angle data are divided into four typical periods to analyzethe change with wind speed, as shown in Figure 7 . When wind speed
is lower than the rated value, the wind turbine operates in themaximum wind energy tracking region, and the blade does notpitch. However, the pitch angle is not zero due to installation,
testing, and the pitch system ’s dynamic characteristics. As shown
inFigures 7A –E, when the wind speed is about 3m/s ~ 6m/s and the
pitch angle is roughly around 0.24
°–0.28°. When the wind speed
exceeds the rated value, the wind turbine operates in the constantoutput power region. During this period, the pitch system drives the
blade to adjust the pitch angle increase or decrease to maintain theoutput power stable at the rated power, as shown in Figures 7F –O.I t
also can be seen from Figures 7F –Othat when the wind speed is
more signi ﬁcant than 8m/s, the output power exceeds the rated
power, and the pitch angle is greater than 4
°, while the absolute pitch
angle speed is more than 0.1 deg/s. It is important to note that pitch
angle control is not based on wind speed but on the average power
output. Considering the massive inertia of the wind wheel, theparameters such as wind speed, pitch angle, and output powerdo not correspond to each other at a speci ﬁc time. When the wind

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
turbine operates in the constant output power region and the wind
speed is relatively stable, the pitch system does not drive the blade topitch but stays on hold. At this time, the pitch angle changes slightly
due to the interference of various factors. As can be seen in Figures
7P–T, the corresponding pitch angle speed distribution is
between −0.02 deg/s and 0.02 deg/s.
According to a comprehensive observation and analysis of
SCADA data, the threshold of pitch angle value is selected as 0.5
°
(βth= 0.5°), and the threshold of pitch angle speed is selected as
0.03 deg/s ( |ςth|= 0.03 deg/s). Taking into account the performance
parameters of the wind turbine and the distribution of the SCADA
data, the wind speed value domain is selected as [2.5 m/s, 8.5 m/s) in
the non-pitch data set D0, and [8.5 m/s, 13.5 m/s] in the pitch data
complementary set RD0. The blade azimuth variation range is [0°,
360°]. The wind speed interval is divided into 0.2 m/s, and the
azimuth interval is divided into 4°.
4.2 Blade pitch load analysis
The combined action of aerodynamic forces generates the blade
pitch load, centrifugal forces, and gravity. To conduct the analysis ofthe in ﬂuence of wind speed and blade azimuth on the pitch load, the
azimuths 0
°,9 0°, 180°, and 270°are selected to investigate the effect of
wind speed, and the wind speed 4 m/s, 7 m/s, 9 m/s and 12 m/s arealso selected to examine the impact of the blade azimuth. Then, thepitch load can be obtained for different wind speeds and azimuth
angles by applying the proposed force estimation method of the
pitch system, as shown in Figure 8 .
As shown in Figure 8 , when the wind speed is relatively low, the
blade pitch load ﬁrst increases slowly with the wind speed and thenrapidly increases with the wind speed. When the wind speed reaches
about 7 m/s, the blade pitch load increases slowly with the windspeed or no longer increases until the wind speed reaches the rated
wind speed. During this period, the wind turbine and its pitch
system enter the state-switching phase, and the blade pitch load andwind speed undergo a very complex nonlinear jump change process.When the wind speed exceeds the rated speed, the blade pitch loaddoes not change signi ﬁcantly with the wind speed. There is an
interesting phenomenon, the blade pitch load ﬁrst increases and
then remains constant with wind speed. The reasons cause thephenomenon mainly has the following aspects. Firstly, when the
wind turbine operates in the maximum wind energy tracking region,
the blade does not pitch, the blade windward surface is the largest,and the aerodynamic force acting on the blade increases with windspeed. Meanwhile, the rotational speed of the wind wheel increaseswith wind speed; aerodynamic and centrifugal forces lead to anincrease in blade pitch load. Secondly, when the wind turbineoperates in the constant output power region, the rotationalspeed of the wind wheel is stable at the rated speed. At the same
time, the centrifugal force remains unchanged. The blade pitch angle
increases with wind speed which results in the decrease of the bladewindward surface. Since the aerodynamic force acting on the bladedepends on the wind pressure (wind speed) and the windwardsurface area, the two increase and decrease to cause the blade pitchload to remain unchanged. In general, the blade pitch control isdesigned to keep the output power constant and the blade pitch loadfrom varying with wind speed.
It also can be seen from Figure 8 that the blade pitch load varies
periodically with the blade azimuth., Taking the wind speed of 7 m/sas an example, when the azimuth changes from 0
°to 90°, the pitch
load decreases with azimuth. The pitch load is almost unchanged
FIGURE 9

(B)Inﬂuence of azimuth on bearing friction torque.
Frontiers in Energy Research frontiersin.org 11Li et al. 10.3389/fenrg.2023.1203158
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
when the azimuth changes from 90°to 180°. When the azimuth
changes from 180°to 270°, the pitch load increases with azimuth, and
when the azimuth changes from 270°to 360°(0°), the pitch load ﬁrst
increases and then decreases. The wind wheel rotates in one circle,and the pitch load changes periodically. The periodicity of blade
pitch load change with azimuth angle is closely related to wind
speed. When the wind speed is relatively low 4m/s, the pitch load isalmost independent of the azimuth angle, and the periodicity is notreﬂected. When the wind speed exceeds 7m/s, the pitch load varies
periodically with azimuth. Comparing wind speeds of 7 m/s, 9 m/sand 12 m/s, it can be seen that the pitch load has a periodic change inamplitude. When the wind speed is 7 m/s, the amplitude of pitchload is about 30 ~ 32kN ·m, with an amplitude ratio of
2(32−30)/(32+30)≈6.5%. When the wind speed is 9 m/s, the
amplitude of pitch load is about 33 ~ 40kN ·m. When the wind
speed is 9 m/s, the amplitude of pitch load is about 28 ~ 41kN ·m,
with no signi ﬁcant increase in pitch load while the amplitude ratioincreases to 2 (41−28)/(41+28)≈38.3% , which means the pitch
loadﬂuctuation increases with wind speed dramatically. It should be
pointed out that the blade pitch load changes periodically with theazimuth angle, and the azimuth corresponding to the amplitudevaries with the change in wind speed. When the wind speed is 7m/s,
the minimum pitch load corresponds to the azimuth of about 120
°,
and the maximum pitch load corresponds to the azimuth of about300
°. When the wind speed is 9 m/s, the minimum pitch load
corresponds to the azimuth of about 60°, and the maximum
pitch load corresponds to the azimuth of about 240°. When the
wind speed is 12 m/s, the minimum value of blade pitch loadingcorresponds to the azimuth of about 300
°, and the maximum pitch
load corresponds to the azimuth of about 90°. When the wind
turbine operates in the maximum wind energy tracking region, the
pitch load varies periodically with the blade azimuth. The pitch loadamplitude increases with the wind speed. However, the initial phaseangle of the pitch load remains unchanged. When the wind turbine

state, and open-pitch state in the constant power output region of wind turbines.

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
operates in the constant output power region, the initial phase angle
of the pitch load decreases with the increase of the wind speed, whilethe amplitude of the pitch load remains the same. This is mainly due
to the aerodynamic, centrifugal force, and gravity acting on the blade
are all distributed forces. The resultant action point and direction arenot only related to the blade shape and pitch angle but also to theblade azimuth angle, so the blade pitch load changes periodicallywith the rotation of the wind wheel and the change of azimuth angle.When the wind turbine operates in the maximum wind energytracking region, the aerodynamic force acting on the blade increaseswith the wind speed, and the pitch load amplitude increases.
However, the periodicity is not obvious at low wind speeds
because the amplitude is relatively small, less than 10%. Since thepitch angle is unchanged, the initial phase angle of the pitch loadremains unchanged, which is why the order of blade pitch loadcorresponding to the four azimuth angles in Figure 8 is not the same.
When the wind turbine operates in the constant output powerregion, the pitch angle increases with the wind speed. Still, the blade
windward surface decreases, keeping the blade pitch load and its
change amplitude constant, and the amplitude ratio is nearly 20%.However, due to the change of pitch angle, the initial phase angle ofpitch load at different wind speeds is different. That is, there is aphase difference.
4.3 Analysis of bearing friction torque
The bearing friction torque prevents the blade from rotating.
When the blades are in the pitch state in the constant output powerstage of the wind turbine, and the pitch system is in the state of

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
smooth-pitch or open-pitch, the bearing friction torque can be
estimated. The sample data near 0°,9 0°, 180°, and 270°are
extracted to investigate the relationship between bearing frictiontorque and wind speed. The sample data near wind speeds 4 m/s,7 m/s, 9 m/s and 12m/s are also extracted to investigate the in ﬂuence
of blade azimuth in bearing friction torque. The estimated results areshown in Figure 9 .
It can be seen from Figure 9 that when the wind turbine
operates in the constant output po wer region, the b earing friction
torque ﬂuctuates around 12 kN ·m .T h eg r e a t e rt h ew i n ds p e e d ,
the greater the ﬂuctuation of the friction torque. This is because
the bearing friction torque de pends on the load and friction
coefﬁcient of the bearing, while the friction coef ﬁcient is only
related to the bearing type, the ﬁt clearance, and the smoothness.
Therefore, for a speci ﬁc bearing, the bearing friction torque
depends on the bearing load. Th e bearing load is generated by
the aerodynamic force, centrifugal force, and gravity acting onthe blade. The blade gravity is constant, and the wind wheelrotates at the rated speed during the constant output poweroutput region, so the centrifuga l force remains unchanged. As
the pitch angle increases with the increase of wind speed, thewindward surface area of the blade decreases to keep theaerodynamic force invariant. Therefore, the bearing load is the
same, and the change in pitch angle only acts on different parts of
the bearing. The bearing friction torque can be estimated fromSCADA data. Once the friction coef ﬁcient is determined, the
bearing load can also be calculated from the bearing frictiontorque. The pitch system bearing of the studied 2 MW windturbine adopts a cylindrical rolle r negative clearance bearing with
a diameter of 2110 mm. The friction coef ﬁcient of the bearing is
close to the sliding friction, which is 0.01. In this way, the blade
bearing of the wind turbine may suffer a load 1 .14 × 10
3N.4.4 Analysis of motor pitch torque
The motor pitch torque is the main force driving the blade to
rotate or keep the blade stationary. Its magnitude depends on theblade pitch load and bearing friction torque and is also related to theblade rotation direction. The sample data near azimuth of 0
+,9 0+,
180+and 270+are selected to investigate the relationship between
the motor pitch torque and the wind speed. At the same time, the
sample data near the wind speed of 4 m/s, 7 m/s, 9 m/s, and 12 m/sare selected to analyze the in ﬂuence of azimuth angle on the motor
pitch torque. The results are shown in Figure 10 ,Figure 11A refers to
the constant state in the maximum wind energy tracking region, andFigure 10 ,Figures 11B –Drefer to the smooth-pitch state, standstill
state, and open-pitch state in the constant power output region ofwind turbines.
When wind turbines operate in the maximum wind energy
utilization region, according to the force equilibrium equationmentioned above, if the friction torque is ignored, the motorpitch torque is equal to the blade pitch load. They all increasewith the increase of wind speed and show periodic changes with therotation of the wind rotor and the change of azimuth, as shown inFigure 10 . Due to the constant pitch angle, the blade forces are
relatively stable, and regression ﬁtting can be performed as shown in
Figure 12 . The mathematical relationship is

From the model, if the in ﬂuence of wind speed is not considered,
that is, assuming that the wind speed is 0 and the blade pitch load is11.53 kN ·m, this can be considered as the blade pitch load generated by

the blade gravity. The blade pitch load is proportional to the square of
wind speed, which is consistent with the fact that the output power of
the wind turbine is proportional to the cubic of wind speed. Theproportion of the periodic function part is very small, so when thew i n ds p e e di sl o w ,t h ep e r i o d i cc h a n g ei sn o ts i g n i ﬁcant. The periodic
variation of blade pitch load has an initial phase angle, which is related to
the blade shape and its spatial position. When wind turbines operate in
the constant power output region, the pitch system is in the variablepitch state, and the change of wind speed causes the correspondingchange of blade pitch angle. This will not only achieve the basic stabilityof output power but also keep the blade pitch load, bearing frictiontorque, and motor pitch torque basically unchanged. However, the pitchangle causes nonlinear factors and torque ﬂuctuations, which will
become more and more severe wit h the increase of wind speed.
According to the blade force equilibrium equation, when the pitch
system is in the open-pitch state, the motor pitch torque is the sum ofthe blade pitch load and bearing friction torque, about 48 kN ·m
(36 kN ·m+ 1 2k N ·m). When the pitch system is in the smooth-pitch
state, the motor pitch torque is the blade pitch load minus the bearingfriction torque, approximately 24 kN ·m( 3 6k N ·m-12 kN ·m). When
the pitch system is in the standstill state, the motor pitch torque isconsidered to be equal to the blad e pitch load, that is, about 36 kN ·m.
When wind turbines are in the three states of open-pitch, smooth-pitch,
and standstill state, motor pitch tor que changes periodically with the
blade rotation and azimuth change, and the amplitude of change isdifferent, as shown in Figure 11 . It can be seen from the ﬁgure that in this
operation region, the ﬂuctuation of motor pitch torque increases with
the increase of wind speed. When the wind speed is 9 m/s, themaximum ﬂuctuation amplitude is about 8.3 kN ·m; when the wind
speed is 12 m/s, the maximum ﬂuctuation amplitude is about
22 kN ·m. It should be noted that these conclusions are based on
the data after averaging.
In summary, for the investigated 2 MW wind turbine, when
operating in a constant power output region, the blade pitch load isapproximately 36 kN ·m. Here, the blade pitch load caused by
gravity is 11.53 kN ·m, accounting for about 32%. During the
rotation and azimuth change, the blade pitch load has a periodicchange amplitude of 13 kN ·m, accounting for about 36.1%. The
bearing friction torque generated during blade rotation and pitch is
approximately 12 kN ·m. During the actual operation of wind
turbines, the wind speed changes randomly, resulting in thechange of blade pitch load and ultimately the change of motorpitch torque. The alternating characteristics of motor pitch torquecome from three aspects. The ﬁrst is the alternating nature of wind
speed in the wind ﬁeld, which depends on the characteristics of
airﬂow variation and is naturally inevitable. The second is the
alternation of blade pitch load when the wind rotor rotates. The
azimuth changes from 0
°to 360°and then returns to 0°. This will be
affected by the spatial relationship between the two centerlines of thewind rotor rotation axis and the blade rotation axis, which existsthroughout the entire process of wind turbine operation. The third isthe switching of the smooth-pitch state and open-pitch state whenthe blade is pitching. The pitch angle increases from 0
°and then
decreases back to 0°, which is caused by the rotation of the blade in
both positive and negative directions. The alternating nature of the
motor pitch torque may be an important reason for affecting thefatigue failure of the components of the pitch system and causing thefailure of the pitch system ( Hameed et al., 2009 ;Bi et al., 2014 ).5 Conclusion
In this paper, the blade pitch principle of a 2 MW direct-drive
wind turbine is analyzed. By investigating the force of the pitchsystem under multiple operating conditions, the force equilibriumequations of the wind turbine blade are established. Based on
SCADA data, a method for estimating the blade pitch load,
bearing friction moment, and motor pitch torque is proposed byusing the multidimensional BIN method. Many interestingphenomena have been observed. When the wind turbine operatesin the maximum wind energy tracking region, the blade pitch loadand motor pitch torque are proportional to the square of the windspeed and show periodic changes with the wind rotor rotation andazimuth changes. When the wind turbine operates in the constant
power output region, the blade pitch load is about 36 kN ·m, and the
blade pitch load caused by gravity is 11.53 kN ·m, accounting for
about 32.1%. In the process of wind rotor rotation and azimuthchange, the amplitude of periodic change is 13 kN ·m, accounting
for about 36.1%. The bearing friction torque ﬂuctuates around
12 kN ·m during the pitching process, accounting for 33.3% of
the pitching load, and the higher the wind speed, the more severe theﬂuctuation. The work of this paper is of great value to fully
understand the load mechanism of pitch system, and can provide
important knowledge support for the design, operation, andmaintenance of large-scale wind turbine pitch system.
