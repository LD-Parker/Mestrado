A fault detection method of wind turbine pitch system using semi-supervised optimal
margin distribution machine (ssODM) optimized by dynamic state transition algorithm(DSTA) [ssODM-DSTA] was proposed to solve the problem of obtaining the optimalhyperparameters of the fault detection model for the pitch system. This method wasadopted to input the three hyperparameters of the ssODM into the dynamic state transitionalgorithm in the form of a three-dimensional vector to obtain the global optimalhyperparameters of the model, thus improving the performance of the fault detectionmodel. Using a random forest to rank the priority of features of the pitch system fault data,the features with large weight proportions were retained. Then, the Pearson correlationmethod is used to analyze the degree of correlation among features, ﬁlter redundant
features, and reduce the scale of features. The dataset was divided into a training datasetand a test dataset to train and test the proposed fault detection model, respectively. Thereal-time wind turbine pitch system fault data were collected from domestic wind farms tocarry out fault detection experiments. The results have shown that the proposed methodhad a positive fault rate (FPR) and fault negative rate (FNR), compared with otheroptimization algorithms.

INTRODUCTION
China ’s energy structure is unceasingly transforming towards low carbon and environmental
protection by striving to build a new energy system and vigorously advocating the developmentof renewable energy industry to achieve the overall objective of carbon emission peak by 2030 andcarbon neutrality by 2060 ( Li and Bo, 2020 ;Qian and Wang, 2020 ;Sun et al., 2015 ). Renewable
energy is a kind of clean and green energy that can replace traditional energy. The emergence of thisenergy has made a great contribution to reducing pollution and emission in the world. Renewable
energy power systems ( Zhang et al., 2021 ;Zhang and Ruan, 2019 ) mainly include wind power
generation, solar power generation, and hydropower generation. Wind power, as an indispensablepart of renewable energy, continues to expand in scale. By the end of 2020, China ’s installed capacity
of grid-connected wind power has reached 281.53 million kW, increasing by 34.6% year over year,accounting for 12.79% of the total installed capacity ( Blaabjerg et al., 2012 ;Blaabjerg and Ke Ma,
2013 ). However, as the wind power industry is rapidly developing, the maintenance and repair
pressure of wind turbines is also increasing. The operating environment of wind turbines is relativelybad. Abnormal climate, unstable wind speed, and other factors often lead to the faults of windturbines and the shutdown ( Song et al., 2021 ;Yang et al., 2021 ).

pitch system, an important part of the wind turbine, are higher
than those of the main shaft, gearbox, and generator ( Wang et al.,
2021 ). In case of any fault, the power generation rate of the wind
turbine will be directly affected, leading to damage to the wind
turbine and huge economic losses. For this reason, effective fault
detection is of great signi ﬁcance for wind turbine pitch systems.
In the wake of the era of big data and emerging machine
learning, fault detection and fault diagnosis methods for windturbines based on machine learning algorithms have graduallymatured in recent years ( Hu et al., 2021 ;Tang et al., 2021 ; Long
et al., 2020). With the wind turbine fault data in the SCADAsystem, which can collect, monitor, and control the operationdata of wind turbines in real-time, it is a common and reliablemethod to choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm forthe fault detection of wind turbines. Machine learning algorithms
mainly include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-
supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Generally,classi ﬁcation methods for wind turbine fault detection include
support vector machine (SVM), arti ﬁcial neural networks
(ANNs) ( Xi et al., 2021 ), and Large margin distribution
machine (LDM) ( Zhang and Zhou, 2014 ). In the literature
(Tuerxun et al., 2021 ), a SVM based on a sparrow search
algorithm (SSA) was used for wind turbine fault diagnosis andhad achieved excellent results. Moreover, a fault diagnosismethod based on stochastic subspace identi ﬁcation and
multinuclear SVM was proposed to identify bearing faults of
wind turbines ( Zhao et al., 2019 ). The ANNs and empirical mode
decomposition (EMD) were used to effectively identify differentturbine imbalance faults in ( Malik and Mishra, 2017 ). In ( Zhang
and Wang, 2014 ), the arti ﬁcial neural networks had a great
diagnosis effect on the main bearing of the wind turbineduring early fault prediction. The cost-sensitive large margindistribution machine (CLDM) proposed in ( Tang et al., 2019 ) can
better deal with the classi ﬁcation imbalance data and
misclassi ﬁcation cost inequality of wind turbine datasets.
The above methods are only applicable to the input data with
characteristic values and tags. However, tags are usually scarce
and expensive in the actual wind turbine data, which can be
effectively dealt with using the semi-supervised learning method.Commonly used semi-supervised learning methods includetransductive support vector machine (TSVM), safe semi-supervised support vector machine (S4VM), and Laplaciansupport vector machine (LaSVM) ( Chong et al., 2020 ). In
(Shen et al., 2012 ), a gear reducer fault diagnosis model based
on EMD and TSVM was proposed to solve the problem ofinsufﬁcient tags of gear reducer data samples, and results have
shown a high fault diagnosis accuracy. In ( Li, 2010 ), graph theory
and transductive support vector machine (GTSVM) was used to
solve the problem of insuf ﬁcient fault samples for training in
mechanical fault diagnosis, and results have shown that thismethod improved the accuracy of fault diagnosis. A new faultalarm rule based on the upper bound of S4VM generalized errorproposed in ( Mao et al., 2020 ) can self-adaptively identify the
occurrence of early bearing faults. In ( Dai et al., 2017 ), a rolling
bearing fault diagnosis method based on composite multi-scaleentropy (CMSE), sequential forward modeling selection, andLaSVM was proposed to solve the problem of the large samplesize of and tagging dif ﬁculty in rolling bearing fault diagnosis, and
results have shown that the effect of fault diagnosis was improved.
The semi-supervised optimal margin distribution machine
(Zhang and Zhou, 2018 ) was a classi ﬁcation algorithm with
high generalization ability, proposed for generalization ability
based on optimal margin distribution machine (ODM) ( Tan
et al., 2020 ).“Lables ”
were given to the samples without lables
and the semi-supervised learning was transformed into“supervised learning ”viathis algorithm. On this basis, on the
premise of optimizing the minimum margin and maximizing thehyperplane, the distribution of sample margin was fullyconsidered and the mean value and variance between sampleswere introduced to improve the classi ﬁcation ability of the
algorithm.
The reasonable selection of hyperparameters can signi ﬁcantly
affect the fault detection performance during fault detection for
wind turbine pitch systems based on a machine learningalgorithm. For this reason, the optimal hyperparameters of thefault detection model should be obtained by optimizing theparameter optimization algorithm ( Long et al., 2021a ;2021b ).
In (Zhang et al., 2020 ), a particle swarm optimization algorithm
(PSO) was used to optimize SVM for fault diagnosis of windturbine gearbox bearings, and results have shown that theprecision and accuracy of diagnosis were improved. In ( Chen,
2020 ), backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and long short-
term memory network (LSTMN) were combined with PSO and
great fault diagnosis results were obtained in wind turbine rolling
bearing fault diagnosis. In ( Odoﬁn et al., 2018 ), a genetic
algorithm (GA) was adopted to optimize the machine learningalgorithm to improve the reliability of the wind turbine energysystem. In ( Zhang et al., 2018 ), GA was introduced into anomaly
identi ﬁcation of wind turbine state parameters to successfully
optimize the anomaly identi ﬁcation results. In ( Yao et al., 2021 ),
grid search (GS) was used to optimize the fault classi ﬁcation
algorithm during battery fault diagnosis and the fault diagnosisaccuracy was improved. In ( Zhang and Sheng, 2021 ), GS was used
to optimize the hyperparameters and kernel functions of support
vector machines to improve the accuracy of the motor fault
diagnosis.
With a design based on a state transition algorithm (STA)
(Zhou et al., 2012 ), the DSTA ( Zhou et al., 2018 ) is a dynamic
stochastic intelligent global optimization method with its ownriskp
riskand restoration in probability prestadjustment strategy.
For the fault detection model of wind turbine pitch system withhigh complexity, using some of the above-mentioned commonoptimization algorithms to optimize its hyperparameters is ofteneasy to fall into local optimization because the scale ofoptimization object is too large and the optimization problem
is too complex. Facing these problems, DSTA can use a dynamic
adjustment strategy to surpass local optimization, and theoptimization algorithm provides four search operators andnovel update and selection methods to support its excellentsearchability according to the different needs of optimizationobjectives. Using DSTA to optimize the fault detection model ofthe wind turbine pitch system can carry out global search andconverge quickly. It is a novel optimal combination of faultdetection models.

For complex and variable pitch system faults, it is often
difﬁcult to select the optimal parameters for the fault detection
model of the wind turbine pitch system. Meanwhile, variablepitch fault data without tags will lead to unsatisfactory fault
detection results. For this problem, a method of optimizing a
ssODM based on a DSTA was proposed.
SEMI-SUPERVISED OPTIMAL MARGIN
DISTRIBUTION MACHINE
Suppose the mean margin value of training dataset samples after
normalization is /hatwiderm. The difference between the margin of the
sample ( xi,yi) after normalization and the mean margin value was/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/hatwidec(xi,yi)−/hatwidecm/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle. So the variance between the maximum mean
margin value and the minimum mean margin value could berepresented in the following form:

/hatwidec/parenleftbigxi,yi/parenrightbig≤/hatwidecm+/hatwideϵi,∀i∈[m],(1)
where the parameter ρwas used to weigh two priorities. As /hatwidec(xi,yi)
could not be more than and less tha n the mean value at the same time,
there were a nonnegative value and a non-zero value in/hatwideξi,/hatwideϵi.T h e
second item of the objective function was the margin variance. ξi/equalsω/hatwideξi
and ϵi/equalsω/hatwideϵi. The above equation could be rewritten as follows:

where cmdid not affect the optimization. When cmwas scaled,
ω,ξiand ϵiwere scaled on the same scale. In this case, the
constraint was still satis ﬁed, and the objective function value
remained unchanged. Set cm/equals1; the equation could be further
rewritten as follows:

As the maximum objective function was equal to the minimum ω2and

A parameter μ∈(0,1) was introduced to weigh the deviation loss in
two different directions between the sample margin and the meanmargin value 1. A parameter θ-insensitive loss was introduced to
control model sparsity. Thus, the ﬁnal equation form was as follows:

FAULT DETECTION FOR WIND TURBINE
PITCH SYSTEM
Concerning the fault detection process of the wind turbine pitch
system, it was roughly made of data screening, data preprocessing,feature selection, data segmentation, training fault detection modeland hyperparameter optimization, fault detection model testing,and detection result evaluation. The fault detection ﬂowchart of the
ssODM-DSTA wind turbine pitch system is shown Figure 2 .
Dataset Description
The experimental data originated from the real-time operation
data of the SCADA system of 1.5 MW double-fed wind turbinesin the domestic wind farm for one year. The data samplinginterval was 1 s. The data of the wind turbines in the wind farm inthe 12th month were selected and the data of three kinds of windturbines ’pitch faults from half an hour before the start of the
faults to half an hour after the end of the faults were interceptedaccording to the fault codes. Three kinds of pitch system faults areused as fault detection targets: emergency stop fault of the pitchsystem, CAN communication fault of the blade 1 servo driver,and low-temperature fault of the blade 2 axle box of the pitch,
respectively.
A pitch emergency stop fault is a fault triggered when the pitch
safety chain acts. The treatment method of this fault is to checkwhether the pitch safety chain is closed and check the pitch faultspeciﬁcally.
CAN communication fault of the blade 1 servo driver is the
CANBUS communication fault between pitch PLC andpitchmaster of blade 1. The troubleshooting method is tocheck the wiring between the main control cabinet EL6751and the X5 terminal on the pitchmaster in the shaft cabinet 2;check whether there is 24V DC voltage between x5-6 and x5-9;
check the resistance between x5-2 and x5-7 (60 Ω); check whether
the axis 2 servo driver is normal.The low-temperature fault of the blade 2 axle box of the pitch
is a temperature fault of the pitch system. The starting reason isgenerally the sensor fault. The fault can be eliminated andhandled by checking various indicators of the sensor. Thethree fault data structures are shown in Table 1 .
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The data of the wind turbine pitch system was fed back to the
SCADA system in the form of a signal after the information wascollected through various sensors such as current, voltage, andspeed. The sensors were precision components. They were easilydisturbed by the environment and their abnormalities in themonitoring process, which often led to abnormalities andvacancies in the data output of SCADA. The fault detectionmodel had high requirements for the quality of data, so it wasnecessary to preprocess the data such as standardization,
normalization, elimination of outliers, vacancy values, and all
“0”eigenvectors ( Tang M et al., 2020 ;Tang S et al., 2020 ).
Feature selection belongs to a data dimensionality reduction
process. The commonly used feature selection methods cover therandom forest method ( C h a r v e n te ta l . ,2 0 2 1 ), extreme gradient
boosting (XGBoost)method ( Chen et al., 2020 ), Pearson ’s correlation
analysis method ( Jebli et al., 2021 ), and categorical boosting
(CatBoost) method ( Yuan et al., 2021 ). The random forest
algorithm was used for ranking the importance of all sub-featuresof the preprocessed fault data of the pitch system with the wind speedas the target feature. Then, the threshold (mean value of all feature
importance scores) was set to screen the features that were highly
related to the target variable. On t he premise of ensuring no loss of
data information content, the number of features of the original datawas reduced from 58 to 30, which effectively reduced the dif ﬁculty of
learning the fault detection model of the wind turbine pitch system.The feature importance ranking of the fault data of the pitch systembased on the random forest is shown in Table 2 (the bold part of No.
1–No. 30 was the 30 features that were saved after screening).
As redundant features with a high correlation may exist
between features and the Pearson-related analysis methodcould be used for ensuring the equal relationship between

features and analyzing the correlation degree between features,
the Pearson-related analysis method was adopted to analyze the
feature correlation of 30 pieces of screened fault data of the pitch
system and remove the redundant features with a high correlationfor further reducing the data capacity. The correlation resultsbetween the features are shown in Table 3 .
Pearson correlation coef ﬁcient was an index describing the
intensity of feature correlation with a value range of [-1, 1]. Thecloser the absolute value of the coef ﬁcient was to “1”, the stronger
the correlation was. The bold parts of Table 3 show that the
feature correlation between different parts of the pitch system wasalso extremely high and the correlation coef ﬁcient between these
features was close to “1”with basically the same effect in the
dataset. These features that belonged to redundant features were
eliminated in the fault dataset of the pitch system and theremaining features were constructed into a new sampledataset. The ﬁnal data structure is shown in Table 4 .
Improved Semi-supervised Optimal Margin
Distribution Machine
The ssODM was equipped with three hyperparameters λ,μ,and
θrepresenting the margin variance balance hyperparameter,
margin deviation balance hyperparameter, and insensitive lossfunction, respectively. The meaning and value range of ssODM
hyperparameters are shown in Table 5 .
The dynamic state transition algorithm was adopted to optimize
the three hyperparameters of ssODM. The classi ﬁcation accuracy
of ssODM was taken as the ﬁtness function to determine the
update and selection of hyperparameters by the dynamic statetransition algorithm. The pseudo-code of the improved ssODM is
shown in Algorithm 1 .

ssODM, respectively. The experimental data were from windturbine pitch system fault data (the fault data of pitch system areset as 5% labeled data and 10% labeled data for experiments,
respectively; the normal sample label is 1 and the fault sample
label is —1), as shown in Table 4 .
When the experimental sample was the emergency stop fault
of the pitch, Figures 3 ,4represent the FPR of fault detection and
the FNR of fault detection, respectively (5% labeled samples).Figures 5 ,6represented the FPR of fault detection and the FNR
of fault detection (10% labeled samples).
When the experimental sample was the CAN communication
fault of blade 1 servo driver, Figures 7 ,8represent the FPR of fault
detection and the FNR of fault detection, respectively (5% labeledsamples). Figures 9 ,10represent the FPR of fault detection and the
FNR of fault detection (10% labeled samples).
When the experimental sample was the low-temperature fault of
the blade 2 axle box of the pitch, Figures 11 ,12represent the FPR of
fault detection and the FNR of fault detection, respectively (5%
labeled samples). Figures 13 ,14represent the FPR of fault
detection and the FNR of fault detection (10% labeled samples).
The above results have demonstrated that the FPR and the
FNR of fault detection regarding the faults for the windturbine pitch system by ssODM-DSTA were the lowestamong the four comparison algorithms. It can beconcluded that using DSTA to optimize ssODM can obtain
super parameters that more meet the performance requirements ofthe pitch system fault detection model, effectively improve the

CONCLUSION
In terms of the problem of obtaining the optimal hyperparameters inthe fault detection model of the wind turbine pitch system, the DSTAwas used for optimizing the three hyperparameters of ssODM. Toverify the effectiveness of this method, ssODM-DSTA was comparedwith ssODM-PSO, ssODM-GA, and ssODM-GS. The experimental
data originated from the three kinds of pitch system fault datapreprocessed by the random forest method and Pearsoncorrelation analysis method, including the emergency stop faultdata of the pitch system, CAN communication fault data of the
blade 1 servo driver, and the low-temperature fault data of the blade 2axle box of the pitch. The experimental results showed that thessODM-DSTA had a strong fault detection ability for the fault of the
wind turbine pitch system. It was provided with a lower FPR and
FNR than those of the model using t he other three kinds of parameter
optimization algorithms. It was proved that the fault detectionmethod of the wind turbine pitch system based on the ssODM-DSTA had an outstanding performance.
Concerning the wind turbine fault detection based on machine
learning, the fault detection model could not be fully learned dueto a shortage of labels, seriously affecting the accuracy of faultdetection. Consequently, the application of unsupervised learningto wind turbine fault detection could further weaken the weight of
