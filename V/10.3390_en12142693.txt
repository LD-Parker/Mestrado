Abstract: In order to reduce operation and maintenance cost and improve fault diagnosis and detection
accuracy for wind turbines, a study on advanced methods has been carried out. The purpose of this
paper is to present a new method developed using radar chart and support vector machine (SVM)
approach for fault diagnosis and prediction of wind turbine pitch system as it usually has a higher
failure rate. In the study, the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system data are
utilized as source data for SVM prediction. First of all, the characteristics of the indicator variable data
collected by the SCADA system are analyzed, and the radar charts corresponding to the normal and
faulty operation of the wind turbine pitch system are constructed using the indicator variable data.
Secondly, the SVM method is used to extract the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features and
histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) features of the radar charts, and the SVM classiÔ¨Åer is trained.
Then, the operational status is predicted, the classiÔ¨Åcation e ect is evaluated by the confusion matrix,
and the prediction evaluation index is calculated. Thirdly, the support vector regression method is
used to analyze the SCADA indicator variable data, the input and output of the regression model are
determined, and the training prediction model is established, and the prediction accuracy of the test
model is analyzed using the test sample data. Finally, the forecasting evaluation indexes obtained by
the above two methods are compared. It proves that the proposed method using SVM to analyze the
system radar charts has a higher prediction accuracy of 91.24% than the support vector regression
method. The prediction accuracy is improved by 8.6%. Hence, it is veriÔ¨Åed that the new method
using a radar chart and SVM approach has superiority over the support vector regression method.

1. Introduction
Wind energy is one of the main renewable energy sources [ 1,2]. It is harvested using wind turbines
and to be converted into electric power. With the increase of installed wind power capacity, more and
more attention has been paid to the reduction of operation and maintenance cost. The operation and
maintenance cost of wind turbines in the whole life cycle accounts for 25‚Äì30% of the total cost, e.g.,
Reference [ 3]. Failure of critical components in wind turbine operation may cause costly repairs and
increased downtime. It is, therefore, that fault diagnosis and prediction has become very important.
It is expected that a fault is to be detected at an earlier stage or to be predicted before it occurs [ 4].
The fault diagnosis and prediction are based on available data, including condition monitoring

data usually collected through condition monitoring system (CMS), and control and operation data
collected through the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. CMS provides
direct information reÔ¨Çecting a mechanical fault or failure, whereas SCADA system provides all other
auxiliary information which assists in improving the e ciency and accuracy of the fault diagnosis and
detection. SCADA system, for example, is an important subsystem in an energy management system
which helps reduce the system operation and maintenance costs [5].
Electrical and electronic control systems in wind turbines are considered to be prone to failure,
but gearbox and generator failures result in the longest downtime. In general, in large wind turbines,
there are three the most vulnerable subsystems identiÔ¨Åed. They are pitch system, frequency converter
and yaw system [ 6]. As a core component of a wind turbine, the pitch system‚Äôs failure rate is even higher
than other mechanical subsystems, such as gearbox in some cases. The damage to the pitch system
not only increases the operation and maintenance cost, but also reduces the production e ciency of
the wind turbine [ 7]. In recent years, there are a number of studies reported on fault diagnosis and
prediction for wind turbine pitch system, e.g., References [ 7‚Äì14]. Based on literature survey, it is found
that the published studies can be generally classiÔ¨Åed into two categories: One is physical model-based
approach, e.g., References [ 12‚Äì15] and the other is based on measurement data, e.g., References [ 16‚Äì20].
The physical model-based approach is mainly used for fault mechanism analysis, and the data-based
studies are for condition assessment and prediction. Asgari [ 8] uses the unknown input observer
combined with the actual operating data of the 660KW wind turbine, and detects and isolates the fault
of the pitch system actuator and the generator rotor temperature rise fault in the MATLAB /Simulink
environment. In Reference [ 9], the identiÔ¨Åcation algorithm of a variable forgetting factor is introduced.
Through the idea of parameter estimation, the natural frequency and damping coe cient of the variable
pitch system actuator are identiÔ¨Åed and estimated, and the system fault is diagnosed by the change of
parameters. Kusiak and Verma [ 10] established a system prediction model that is based on data mining
technology for fault diagnosis of actuator failure of wind turbine pitch system. Based on the analysis of
the fault characteristics of the hydraulic pitch system, Han [ 11] established the fault tree model of the
hydraulic pitch system, and used the combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis to realize
fault diagnosis. At present, the failure of the pitch system is mostly diagnosed for the mechanical
failure of the system, and the diagnosis of the electrical failure of the pitch system needs to be further
studied. In Reference [ 12], a combined adaptive and parameter estimation scheme and its application
to fault prediction for wind turbines is proposed, which is based on the dynamic wind turbine and
pitch system model. A set of possible faults a ecting system dynamics is described. In Reference [ 13],
a model-based variable pitch actuator fault detection method is proposed. When the pitch actuator is
dynamically changed, the normalized gradient method is used to estimate the parameters of the pitch
actuator and obtain the residual signal. Based on the wind farm SCADA data, Reference [ 14] proposed
a generalized model of wind turbine anomaly identiÔ¨Åcation. The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation
method is used to synthesize the results of the selected wind turbine condition parameter prediction
model. Reference [ 15] gave a method for diagnosing faults in the wind turbine pitch actuator that
causes a change in pitch angle. The interval prediction algorithm is combined with recursive subspace
recognition based on the variable forgetting factor algorithm. Reference [ 16] proposes to select more
important variables in the SCADA system to improve the prediction accuracy, and adopts an index
based on the exponentially weighted moving average model to eliminate the autocorrelation in the data.
In Reference [ 17], an adaptive neural fuzzy inference system based on prior knowledge (APK-ANFIS)
is proposed to analyze wind turbine SCADA data to realize automatic detection of signiÔ¨Åcant pitch
faults. An 85.50% classiÔ¨Åcation accuracy was achieved in Reference [ 18] through 14 human-readable
rules generated by the RIPPER induction rule learner. Of these rules, 11 were described as ‚Äúuseful
and intuitive‚Äù by independent domain experts, and further, expert systems were developed using the
model and domain knowledge. In Reference [ 19], for the slip ring pollution and the pitch controller
failure, a novel pitch fault detection method based on performance curve (PC) normal behavior model
(NBMs) is proposed. The power-generator speed (P-N) and pitch angle-generator speed (PA-N) curves
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

were selected to establish NBMs, and behavioral curves were used to analyze behavioral di erences
for fault prediction. A model-based fault detection and isolation scheme for wind turbine variable
pitch systems is presented in Reference [ 20] to detect faults in electric pitch actuators and sensors,
where an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) based multi-model adaptive estimation (MMAE) is designed
to estimate the state of the system. In Reference [ 21], a designed algorithm based on the H2 norm
optimization technique is proposed to detect blade and pitch system faults, and to repair false positive
rate and detection speed as needed. In Reference [ 22], the fault diagnosis method of an innovative
stochastic gradient algorithm based on the observer is proposed for the characteristics of wind turbine
variable pitch system failure, which causes system parameters to change. The use of similar functions
combined with Kohonen neural network for fault diagnosis is discussed in Reference [ 23] where the
fuzzy clustering based on Kohonen neural network is used to solve the problem, and the optimized
samples are used as input to the Kohonen network to obtain various types of standard fault models.
Generally, wind turbine fault prediction is achieved using mathematical modeling, but it is
dicult to establish an accurate mathematical model because of complicated control in wind turbine
operation [ 24]. This paper analyzes the failure of electronically controlled pitch system of wind turbines,
where there are di erent types of failure modes. The main faults include: Blade 95-degree limit switch
is triggered; pitch system charging device voltage is abnormal; blade synchronizing error; blade PMC
controller output is overcurrent; blade PMC motor side grounding is short circuit; blade following
error is over the limit; blade velocity controller output frequency exceeds the maximum rotational
speed; blade CANbus communication error; digital channel fault of blade motor encoder; blade power
detector failed; blade PMM analogue to digital converter error; pitch system input power voltage is
lower; PMC controller output is overcurrent; etc. Considering that there are so many types of failure
modes involved in the above-mentioned electronically controlled pitch system, it is very di cult
or impossible to establish a perfect model for pitch system fault prediction. This paper proposes to
follow a data-driven approach rather than a model-based approach to predicting the pitch system error
in operation. Therefore, this paper starts to analyze SCADA data in order to identify the indicator
variables that can reÔ¨Çect the majority of pitch system faults. Support vector machine (SVM) method is
employed to train the prediction models by utilizing the condition monitoring and system operation
data. When a failure in the electronically controlled pitch system occurs, there are seven indicators
identiÔ¨Åed which reÔ¨Çect the change through an experimental analysis. These indicators are wind speed,
wind direction, rotor speed, rotor position, output power, grid-connected frequency and pitch angle.
The data of these seven indicators are extracted from a 1.5 MW wind turbine SCADA system. Then,
this paper applies the method of analyzing SCADA indicator variable data to establish radar charts to
perform the prediction of wind turbine pitch system failure.
2. Pitch System Data Processing
The pitch system faults account for a large proportion in the SCADA data fault list. In the
predictive analysis of pitch faults, in general, only those common faults are of the focus in study and
discussion. The readers are referred to the brief review given in the introduction section to learn more
about the prediction methods developed. Here, we propose an innovative approach to predicting
the pitch faults by using radar charts and SVM method. To apply this new approach, the Ô¨Årst step
is to collect the relevant data. In this study, one 1.5 MW wind turbine model is selected from which
the SCADA system data is collected. A total of 400 data sets were collected, and classiÔ¨Åed into two
groups. One group of 200 data sets represents the normal operation condition of the pitch system,
whereas another group with the other 200 data sets represents the condition with the turbine pitch
faults. The closer it is to the fault occurrence, the clearer it is to reÔ¨Çect the fault by the running and
condition monitoring data. Therefore, the data representing the system condition 30 minutes before
the fault occurs is collected. Through experimental analysis for testing the SVM method developed;
when the wind turbine has a pitch failure, the related indicators are identiÔ¨Åed which are wind speed,
wind direction, rotor speed, rotor position, output power, grid-connected frequency and pitch angle.

The data collection frequency is one per 10 seconds. Table 1 lists a set of indicator variables data‚Äîfor
example, when the system is in faulty operation. The negative value in the column ‚ÄòOutput power‚Äô
means that there is no power output to the grid, but the wind turbine is getting power from the grid.
The data in each data set is displayed in an excel data table. Select the input quantity of indicators,
including wind speed, wind direction, rotor speed, rotor position, grid-connected frequency and pitch
angle, shown in a matrix table marked as I. Its dimension is 72,400 6. The output is output power
recorded and marked as O; the dimension is 72,400 1. Therefore, a matrix, including input and
output variable values is given in another matrix, M,M=[I,O]. The matrix table of the collected data
under the pitch faulty condition is marked as I1, and the matrix to show the normal condition data
is marked as I2. The dimension of I1and I2is 36,2006. The output power data under the pitch
faulty condition and normal condition are given in other separate matrixes marked as O1and O2,
respectively, with a dimension of 36,200 1. Then, there will be the matrixes M1=[I1,O1]under
pitch faulty condition and M2=[I2,O2]under normal pitch condition.
Based on the indicator variable data collected and managed as above, the radar charts
corresponding to the pitch faulty and normal condition can be drawn, as shown in Figure 1. Taking
the wind speed in the range from 3 m /s to 21 m /s; the radar charts with 18,001 frames corresponding to
faulty and normal pitch condition are generated, respectively. The Ô¨Årst 10,000 frames of the charts are
used for training, and the remaining 8001 frames are used for testing in each. The numbers 1 to 7 in
each chart represent the seven indicators in Table 1, i.e., 1 means wind speed, 2 represents indicator 2
which is wind direction; 3 means rotor speed and so on.

SVM is a machine learning method with supervised features, which improves the 
generalization ability of machine learning through structural risk minimiza tion [25]. The empirical 
risk and confidence interval are minimized, and the pattern classification is effectively performed by 
extracting the characteristics of the radar chart drawn using the data of related indicators. 
Figure 2 below shows the flow diagram of the algorithm for processing image classification 
using SVM. The flow chart mainly includes extraction of the image features, SVM classification operation, sample prediction and su rface classification effect through the confusion matrix. First, the 
input picture is converted into a grayscale image, the image gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) 
feature is extracted and normalized, and then the grayscale image is binarized. The image histogram 
of oriented gradients (HOG) features are extracte d, and the GLCM features and HOG features are 
combined as feature vectors of the image, and the algorithm outputs are characteristics and tags of 
the training set and the test sets. Secondly, the SVM classifier is trained by the obtained image features. Then, the prediction of the sample tag is  performed using the feature vector of the test 
image. Finally, the classification effect is ev aluated through a constructed confusion matrix. 
Figure 1. Indicator data radar charts.
As can be seen from Figure 1, the radar charts of indicator variable data under normal pitch
condition are more evenly distributed, and the radar charts of the indicator variable data under faulty
pitch condition are less dispersed. The traditional analysis methods are based on the training analysis
of fault data. This paper, however, proposes a novel analysis method based SVM for training and
testing the indicator variable data radar charts under both normal and faulty pitch condition to predict

the operation status of the wind turbine pitch system. Through analysis of the prediction accuracy, it is
proved that the proposed method is more feasible for predicting pitch failure.
At the same time, the regression model is obtained using the training dataset data by support
vector regression (SVR) method, and the prediction performance of the regression model is veriÔ¨Åed by
the test set data. The predicted output power obtained by the regression model is compared with the
actual output power, and the error evaluation indices are calculated to analyze the operational status
of the pitch system.

3.1.1. Image Feature Extraction 
The indicator variable data radar charts under  normal operation and pitch faulty operation 
have differences in their shape characteristics. It is to predict the indicator variable values under 
normal operation and pitch faulty condition by extracting the image GLCM feature and HOG feature in this paper. Before performing featur e extraction, the RGB color space image is first 
converted into a gray image, and the gray image is converted into a binary image by setting a 
threshold. The threshold is set to be 0.5608. 
For Grayscale image GLCM feature extraction, it is noticed that the indicator variable data 
radar charts under normal operation and pitch faul ty condition have different grayscale features. 
Here, the average value and variance are taken as the final extracted features of the image, and the mean value indicates that the degree of brightness to  darkness of the image. The variance is used to 
display grayscale contrast. The larger the variance value is, the greater the grayscale contrast of the 
image is. 
3.1.2. Constructing Confusion Matrix 
This paper evaluates the classification effect of the algorithm by co nstructing a confusion 
matrix. The confusion matrix presents the visuali zation effect of the performance of the algorithm 
through a specific matrix, which is a situation analysis table that summarizes the prediction results of the classification model in machine learning. In the evaluation, the following terms are used: TP (True Positive) means that the true value is true an d the predicted value is true; FN (False Negative) 
means that the true value is true and the predicted va lue is false; FP (False Positive) means that the 
true value is false and the predicted value is true ; and TN (True Negative) means that the true value 
is false and the predicted value is false. Then, the prediction performance is evaluated by the following five indices:

The indicator variable data radar charts under normal operation and pitch faulty operation have
dierences in their shape characteristics. It is to predict the indicator variable values under normal

This paper evaluates the classiÔ¨Åcation e ect of the algorithm by constructing a confusion matrix.
The confusion matrix presents the visualization e ect of the performance of the algorithm through
a speciÔ¨Åc matrix, which is a situation analysis table that summarizes the prediction results of the
classiÔ¨Åcation model in machine learning. In the evaluation, the following terms are used: TP (True

3.2. Support Vector Regression Prediction
SVR is the application of SVM to regression problems [ 26]. SVR can deal with practical problems,
such as small samples, nonlinear and high digits, and can be e ectively applied to modeling and
prediction of nonlinear data and even optimization control. At the same time, it overcomes the issues
that network structures, such as neural networks are di cult to determine, and it is prone to fall in
local convergence so as to turn out the local extreme points [27].
When using SVR to handle regression problems for a given sample set { (xi,yi)} (i=1, 2,L,M),
xiis the ithm-dimensional input vector, yiis the ith output vector and Mis the sample size. Through a
function, g(x), the m-dimensional input vector is mapped into the l-dimensional feature space, l>m.
The SVR implementation constructs a hyperplane f(x)=!Tg(x)+bin the feature space, where !is
thel-dimensional weight vector, and bis the bias term. The purpose is to obtain the distanceyi f(xi)
<"from all sample points to the hyperplane, where "is the given precision. When the error is less
than", it is not considered. When the error is greater than ", the extra error is usually expressed by the
relaxation factors and*.
According to the structural risk minimization criterion, the optimization objectives and constraints
of the SVR model are expressed, respectively, as follows [28]:

where,"0 is the Ô¨Åtting accuracy of the function; i0 and

is used to control the degree of penalty for the sample exceeding the error, ".
The non-negative Lagrangian multipliers iand

corresponding constraints, and the Lagrange function is constructed to transform the Equation (6) as:

By solving Equation (7), the optimal hyperplane function is obtained,

An important concept in this model is the kernel function. From the Mercer theorem, this kernel
function is:
K(xi,x) =gT(xi)g(x). (9)
Thus, insert Equation (9) into Equation (8), the optimal hyperplane function is changed to:

Equation (10) is the SVR function. Figure 3 gives a Ô¨Çow diagram showing the SVR prediction

the seven indicators selected, then select a kernel function and regression parameter values, such as
the kernel function is selected as a linear function f(x)=!Tx+bandC=2.2 based on a preliminary
study. After that, do sample data pretreatment, that is, the indicator variables data are organized and
put into a designed table in excel spreadsheet like Table 1, for instance. The data is then grouped into
two groups as training data and testing data, for example, 75% of the data is used for training model,
and the remaining 25% is used for testing the model. Train the model until the model evaluation
criteria, R2and RMSE values are satisÔ¨Åed, i.e., R2is larger than the threshold and RMSE is less than the
setting target. After the model is obtained, it is tested using the test sample data.

4. Prediction Results and Analysis  
In order  to verify the effectiveness of the SVM algorithm, the radar charts are processed first, to 
achieve the radar charts of the indicator variable data under pitch system normal and faulty 
operation condition, followed by feature extraction. Finally, the SVM t raining model is used to 
generate the confusion matrix and analyze the prediction indices.  
At the same time, the SVR model is established for the normal operation of SCADA data. For 
different operating conditions, the actual output power and the output pow er of the training model 
are compared to obtain the SVR model prediction accuracy.  
By comparing the prediction effects of the above two methods, the feasibility and efficiency of 
using the SVM to forecast the wind turbine pitch system under normal and faul ty condition are 
verified using the real wind turbine operation data in production.

4. Prediction Results and Analysis
In order to verify the e ectiveness of the SVM algorithm, the radar charts are processed Ô¨Årst,
to achieve the radar charts of the indicator variable data under pitch system normal and faulty operation
condition, followed by feature extraction. Finally, the SVM training model is used to generate the
confusion matrix and analyze the prediction indices.
At the same time, the SVR model is established for the normal operation of SCADA data.
For di erent operating conditions, the actual output power and the output power of the training model
are compared to obtain the SVR model prediction accuracy.
By comparing the prediction e ects of the above two methods, the feasibility and e ciency of
using the SVM to forecast the wind turbine pitch system under normal and faulty condition are veriÔ¨Åed
using the real wind turbine operation data in production.
4.1. SVM for Graphics Prediction and Prediction Accuracy Analysis
The SVM algorithm is used to perform fault prediction on the generated radar charts under
dierent operation states of the wind turbine using the data collected. The radar charts plotted with
the indicator variable data are shown in Figure 4. First, the radar image is grayscale processed, and the
GLCM features of the image are extracted, and the average and variance are taken as the Ô¨Ånal extracted
features of the image. The HOG features of the radar charts are then extracted, and the GLCM
features and HOG features are combined as feature vectors of the image. After the SVM is trained,
the classiÔ¨Åcation e ect of the model is evaluated by the generated confusion matrix.

shown in Figure 4. 
(2) Image Feature Extraction 
Here, the average value and the variance are used as the GLCM features of the extracted 
image. Since there are too many image samples and it  is difficult to observe the feature difference, 
we select 150 sample charts from normal pitch sy stem operation and 150 sample charts from when 
the system is in faulty condition to make a comparison in mean and variance of the GLCM features 
of the extracted image. The numbers 1‚Äì7 in Figure 4 represent the seven indicators in Table 1.

Figure 5 shows the GLCM feature average of gr ayscale values of the images for comparison. 
The feature extraction of the radar charts is from four directions, Œ∏ = 0¬∞, 45¬∞, 90¬∞, 135 ¬∞; and the 150 
average values of the radar charts when the pitch system is in normal and faulty condition are 
calculated. Similarly, Figure 6 shows the comparison of GLCM feature variance of grayscale values 
of the images in these four directions. 
As shown in Figures 5 and 6, there is only a small or no overlap of the mean value and 
variance of the GLCM feature of the radar charts under two different conditions, the wind turbine 
pitch system faulty and normal operation stat us can be clearly distinguished. Obviously,  the mean 
value of the feature under wind turbine faulty condition, as shown in Figure 5, is lower than the normal operation status except for the 0
¬∞ direction; and the value under normal operation 
status in Figure 6 is always hi gher than the faulty condition. This provides a basis for the 
prediction of the subsequent operational status , i.e., normal operation or faulty condition.

wind farm. The seven indicator variables data were extracted from the collected data set to construct a

4.3.2. Summary and Discussion
Based on the above comparison analysis of the competitive models for prediction of pitch system
failure, it has been found that the SVM method based on the radar charts generated using the
relevant indicators data extracted from the collected wind turbine operation and monitoring data sets
provides the best performance in prediction of pitch system failure than other competitive approaches.
The prediction accuracy in terms of pitch system fault is as high as 91.24%, which is clearly higher than
other models developed using multivariate regression and Neural Network techniques. The main
reason may be due to the advantages of the SVM method as discussed below:
(1) For the fault prediction of wind turbine pitch control system, the image processing accuracy is
higher than the data processing accuracy. In this study, the SVM is used to process the generated radar
charts, and SVR is based on the recorded data so that the prediction accuracy using the SVM method is
higher than using SVR.
(2) SVM is a novel small sample learning method with a solid theoretical background. In essence,
it avoids the traditional from induction to deduction process, and can achieve e cient "transduction
reasoning" from training samples to forecast samples, which greatly simpliÔ¨Åes the general classiÔ¨Åcation
and regression process in problem solution.
(3) In general, a small proportion of support vectors determine the Ô¨Ånal result in a prediction
analysis. This tells us to search for and grasp the key samples among a large number of redundant
samples so that the developed algorithm shall be simple and show good ‚Äúrobustness‚Äù. The SCADA
system collects a large amount of data, and it inevitably involves redundant and useless information,
which will cause interference to the training model. For this reason, SVM is used for classiÔ¨Åcation in
this study.

(4) It is Ô¨Ånally to solve a convex quadratic programming problem. In theory, we will get the
globally optimal solution and solve the issue with local extremum with SVW, which is, however, hardly
avoided in the neural network method.
Although it is known that it is di cult to solve the multi-classiÔ¨Åcation problem with SVM,
the focus of this research is on binary-pattern classiÔ¨Åcation, so that it does not involve this issue.
5. Conclusions
In this paper, the SVM method is utilized to process the radar charts generated using the wind
turbine pitch system operation indicators data collected. The data representing the wind turbine pitch
system under normal operation condition and faulty condition were collected, and the corresponding
radar charts were plotted. In the analysis, it is Ô¨Årst to make the radar image grayed out, and the average
value and variance of the gray image GLCM feature extracted are calculated. The HOG features are
extracted after binarization, and the GLCM features and HOG features are combined as feature vectors
of the image. Then the SVM prediction model is trained, and Ô¨Ånally, the prediction accuracy of the
prediction model is evaluated using the confusion matrix constructed. The prediction index values of
TP , FN, FP and TN are obtained and the six types of prediction evaluation indices are analyzed, namely,
the prediction accuracy, the accuracy to be predicted as true, the accuracy to be predicted as false,
the accuracy of the true to be predicted as true, the accuracy of the false to be predicted as false, and the
total false alarm rate of the prediction. It is veriÔ¨Åed that the prediction indices given by the new method
proposed in this paper are better than the SVR prediction approach through comparison analyses.
The prediction accuracy is 91.24% by the new method, which is increased by 8.6% by comparing to the
SVR prediction model in the case study. The proposed SVM method is also veriÔ¨Åed better than other
competitive methods, such as the ones using multivariate linear regression, BP Neural Network and
wavelet Neural Network techniques in prediction of pitch system failure based on a comparison study.
The data used in this paper is from the real data recorded through a wind farm SCADA system
in Hebei province, China. Similarly, the radar charts are also generated using the real data of seven
indicator variables from the SCADA system. In the model training phase, the training data is collected
from the SCADA system. And in the testing phase, the data generated by the model is compared to
the real data from the SCADA system as well. As a result, the proposed method has great value for the
application. It can be applied for real testing.
With the proposed method, a number of wind turbine pitch faults can be predicted before a real
failure occurs so that it can help reduce the number of unscheduled shutdowns of wind turbines and
the maintenance activities could be planned well based on the predicted condition of the pitch system.
Therefore, this method can help reduce the wind turbine maintenance cost and increase the potential
for more electric power production.
