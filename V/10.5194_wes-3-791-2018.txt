Abstract. In this work, a new algorithm is presented to correct for pitch misalignment imbalances of wind
turbine rotors. The method uses signals measured in the Ô¨Åxed frame of the machine, typically in the form of
accelerations or loads. The amplitude of the one per revolution signal harmonic is used to quantify the imbalance,
while its phase is used to locate the unbalanced blade(s). The near linearity of the unknown relationship between
harmonic amplitude and pitch misalignment is used to derive a simple algorithm that iteratively rebalances the
rotor. This operation is conducted while the machine is in operation, without the need for shutting it down.
The method is not only applicable to the case of a single misaligned blade, but also to the generic case of
multiple concurrent imbalances. Apart from the availability of acceleration or load sensors, the method requires
the ability of the rotor blades to be commanded independently from one another, which is typically possible
on many modern machines. The new method is demonstrated in a realistic simulation environment using an
aeroservoelastic wind turbine model in a variety of wind and operating conditions.
1 Introduction
The pitch system has the highest failure rate of all wind tur-
bine components (Wilkinson et al., 2010). Issues can include,
among others, faults of the pitch actuators or of the pitch
angle sensors, but they can also be caused by an imperfect
installation of the blades. In general, rotor asymmetries rep-
resent a signiÔ¨Åcant problem for wind turbines, as also wit-
nessed by the fact that certiÔ¨Åcation guidelines require the
veriÔ¨Åcation of the effects of even relatively small pitch mis-
alignments (typically 0:3for two blades; GL Standards,
2010, Sect. 4.3.4.1, pp. 4‚Äì20).
Irrespective of the speciÔ¨Åc type of fault, a pitch imbalance
will have as a direct consequence not only a possible de-
crease in harvested energy but, most importantly, also an in-
creased level of vibrations and rotor speed Ô¨Çuctuations (Hy-
ers et al., 2006; Kusiak and Verma, 2011). In fact, when a
pitch misalignment among the blades is present, the periodic
aerodynamic, dynamic and gravitational loading experienced
by the blades is not balanced. As a result, additional har-
monic components are transferred from the rotating to theÔ¨Åxed frame, resulting in vibrations that may lead to the fail-
ure of other components of the machine and that may also af-
fect its fatigue life if not promptly corrected for (Yang et al.,
2008). Moreover, whenever vibrations are fed back to the
turbine control laws, imbalances can also result in increased
duty cycles for the machine actuators.
Currently, the downtime related to pitch failures is rela-
tively high (Wilkinson et al., 2010). In fact, once an anoma-
lous behavior has been detected ‚Äì typically by higher than
expected Ô¨Åxed-frame vibrations; see Hameed et al. (2009) ‚Äì
pitch correction operations are often initiated by a visual in-
spection. An operator (more recently with the possible aid of
a drone) takes pictures or videos of the blades, which are later
analyzed to reveal whether all blades have the same pitch an-
gle. Once a pitch offset has been estimated, the blade pitch
is reset to align it with the others. This operation will im-
ply some downtime and may come at a non-negligible cost.
Furthermore, the procedure might not always be able to pro-
duce an exactly balanced rotor. Clearly, more effective condi-
tion monitoring and correction strategies for the pitch system

792 M. Bertel√® et al.: Automatic pitch misalignment detection and correction
of wind turbines should be developed. An ideal solution for
correcting misaligned blades should be able to Ô¨Årst identify
when a rotor is unbalanced, and then it should be able to au-
tomatically rebalance it. This should be obtained without the
need to shut down the machine, without the presence and su-
pervision of an operator, and without the need for expensive
extra hardware.
Imbalance detection and correction techniques have been
developed both in the literature and in practical applications.
For example, Pierce and Slack (2009) and Axelsson et al.
(2014) report on methods that reduce a rotor imbalance by
Ô¨Årst arbitrarily setting a pitch offset and then measuring the
resulting loads and accelerations on the shaft or on the yaw
system. However, no mathematical formulation is provided
by the authors, thus preventing a better understanding of
the methodology and its limits. Niebsch et al. (2010) and
Niebsch and Ramlau (2014) proposed a method to simul-
taneously estimate both mass and aerodynamic imbalance
effects from nacelle vibrational measurements. The method
considers a Ô¨Ånite-element model of the turbine, and the im-
balance terms are obtained by solving an inverse problem
through nonlinear regularization theory. The results are in-
teresting although not excellent, with errors in the estimation
of the pitch misalignment up to 0.5. However, the need for
a detailed model of the machine may hinder the applicability
of this method. A different approach was proposed by Kus-
nick et al. (2015). In this case, the blade misalignment esti-
mation is performed by an ad hoc workÔ¨Çow using multiple
measurements, including power output, blade loads and ac-
celerations. Finally, a method based on system identiÔ¨Åcation
is presented by Cacciola et al. (2016). In that work, a neural
network is trained based on nodding moment and power mea-
surements from different experiments conducted for varying
known pitch misalignments and operating conditions. After
training, the network is able to detect the severity and loca-
tion of the imbalance, even distinguishing effects caused by
pitch misalignments from those induced by ice accretion.
Ad hoc controllers have also been formulated to correct
for rotor imbalances (Kanev and van Engelen, 2009; Kanev
et al., 2009; Petrovi ¬¥c et al., 2015; Cacciola and Riboldi, 2017;
Cacciola et al., 2017). In all these cases, the general idea is to
develop a control law that compensates for a pitch misalign-
ment by targeting imbalance-induced vibrations, typically
by Coleman-transforming blade loads (Bossanyi, 2003). One
possible drawback of such approaches is the resulting extra
control activity necessary to rebalance the rotor, which will
induce extra duty cycles in the pitch system.
The analysis of signals such as loads and accelerations
measured on the wind turbine Ô¨Åxed frame provides a way
to determine if a rotor is unbalanced. In fact, it is well known
that the amplitude of the 1P (once per revolution) harmonic
is an indicator of an unbalanced rotor. Recently, it was shown
that the phase of that same harmonic can be used to identify
the unbalanced blade(s) (Cacciola et al., 2016). Based on this
simple signal analysis, a condition monitoring system can bedeveloped to detect the severity and location of the imbal-
ance in order to schedule appropriate maintenance and repair
actions.
In the present work, the same concept is used to automati-
cally rebalance an unbalanced rotor. In a nutshell, the method
works as follows. First, an unknown linear relationship is as-
sumed between pitch setting of the blades and the 1P ampli-
tude of a signal measured in the Ô¨Åxed frame. Exploiting the
radial symmetry of a rotor, the coefÔ¨Åcients of the linear rela-
tionship are reduced to only two. In addition, this also has the
effect of including the phase information in the model, which
eventually allows one to correctly identify the pitch misalign-
ment of each blade. Since the linear imbalance‚Äìdisturbance
model is determined by two parameters, one single additional
measurement (in addition to the one performed on the cur-
rently unbalanced conÔ¨Åguration) is necessary to identify the
unknown imbalance‚Äìdisturbance relationship. This is easily
achieved by pitching the blades by some amount and measur-
ing the resulting 1P amplitude. Once the linear relationship is
known, it is trivial to compute the blade pitch offset that, by
zeroing the 1P amplitude, balances the rotor. To account for
possible small nonlinearities, the procedure can be iterated
a few times as necessary. A similar approach was presented
in Bertel√® et al. (2017), which considered only the case of
a pitch fault located in one single blade. The present work
expands and generalizes this methodology, allowing for the
detection and correction of multiple simultaneous pitch im-
balances.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formulates
the proposed imbalance detection and correction procedure.
In particular, Sect. 2.1 shows the mechanism through which
a pitch imbalance causes a 1P load in the Ô¨Åxed frame by
developing a spectral analysis of the relevant loads and ex-
plaining their origin. Next, Sect. 2.2 formulates the linear
imbalance‚Äìdisturbance model of an axial-symmetric rotor,
while Sect. 2.3 shows how the model coefÔ¨Åcients can be
readily identiÔ¨Åed by using two Ô¨Åxed-frame measurements at
two different pitch settings. Lastly, Sect. 2.4 explains the re-
balancing procedure. Results are discussed in Sect. 3, which
reports extensive numerical simulations performed with a
state-of-the-art aeroservoelastic model operating in a vari-
ety of different turbulent winds. Tests are conducted in re-
alistic scenarios, in the sense that rebalancing is performed
while the wind turbine is operating in changing wind con-
ditions, including modiÔ¨Åcations in air density, wind speed,
shear, yaw misalignment, upÔ¨Çow angle and turbulence inten-
sity. Details on the speciÔ¨Åc combinations of conditions used
in the tests are reported in Appendix A. In addition, Sect. 3.4
presents a study assessing the effects of measurement noise
on the method performance, with the goal of deÔ¨Åning min-
imum speciÔ¨Åcation requirements for the whole measuring
chain. Finally, Sect. 4 draws conclusions and gives an out-
look on future work.

2 Methods
2.1 Spectral analysis of an unbalanced rotor
In a balanced rotor with Bblades, under the assumption of a
periodic response, loads transmitted from the rotating frame
of reference to the Ô¨Åxed frame contain only nBP frequen-
cies. Indeed, the rotor acts as a Ô¨Ålter: while the full spectrum
of frequencies is observed in the rotating frame (1P, 2P, 3P,
4P, . . . ), in the Ô¨Åxed frame only frequencies that are multiples
of the number of blades appear ( BP, 2BP, 3BP, . . . ).
On the other hand, when an imbalance is present, other
harmonic components can be detected in Ô¨Åxed-frame mea-
surements, the most prominent typically being the 1P har-
monic. Hence, detection and correction of rotor imbalances
can be based on the analysis of the 1P harmonic measured in
the Ô¨Åxed frame.
As an example, consider the measurement of nacelle fore‚Äì
aft accelerations, which are primarily caused by Ô¨Çuctuations
in the rotor thrust. The thrust force ton the rotor can be com-
puted by summing up the out-of-plane shear forces tiof the
Bblades, as illustrated in Fig. 1.
The shear force of the generic ith blade can be expanded
in Fourier series as

; (1)
where iD 1C2(i 1)=Bis the azimuthal angle, sub-
scripts ()ncand ()nsrefer to thenP cosine and sine compo-
nents, respectively, and t0is the 0th harmonic constant am-
plitude.Assuming a periodic response, the harmonic amplitudes
are the same for the various blades; i.e.,
t0Dt0iDt0j; (2a)
tncDtnciDtncj; (2b)
tnsDtnsiDtnsj: (2c)
In the presence of an imbalance, the harmonic amplitudes of
thekth (unbalanced) blade will differ from the other ones and
can be expressed as
t0kDt0Ct0; (3a)
tnckDtncCtnc; (3b)
tnskDtnsCtns: (3c)
Inserting Eqs. (2) and (3) into Eq. (1) and using the proper-
ties of trigonometric functions, one can readily compute the
thrust forcetas

where D 1. Equation (4c) states that, when the rotor is
balanced (i.e., when t0DtncDtnsD0), then only nB
harmonics are present in the spectrum of t. On the other hand,
when the rotor is unbalanced
1. intermediate harmonics also pollute the spectrum, and
2. the phase of these harmonics indicates the unbalanced
blade.
Limiting the analysis to the case of the lowest harmonics of
both expansions in Eq. (4c), which are typically the most en-
ergetic ones, leads to
tD(Bt0Ct0)0PC(t1ccos kCt1ssin k)1P
CB(tBccos(B )CtBssin(B ))BP: (5)
This expression states that the 1P harmonic in the Ô¨Åxed frame
is generated by the 1P harmonic of the unbalanced blade.
This is not always the case, as the result depends on the con-
sidered Ô¨Åxed-frame load. For example, similar derivations
performed for the nodding (overturning) moment show that
the 0P of the unbalanced blade also contributes to the 1P in
the Ô¨Åxed frame in that particular case. This is beneÔ¨Åcial be-
cause, as shown later on, the 0 and 1P imbalance harmonics
have a different aerodynamic origin. In fact, numerical exper-
iments show that an improved performance and robustness
of the detection algorithm can be obtained by using as an im-
balance detection signal the overturning or yawing moments.

However, since load sensors in the Ô¨Åxed frame are typically
difÔ¨Åcult to install, a similar effect can be obtained by using
the difference of two fore‚Äìaft accelerometers located in the
nacelle at a distance between the two of them (which, de-
pending on their positions, will measure nodding or yawing
motions of the rotor or combinations thereof).
To better understand the effects of a pitch imbalance, the
expression for the aerodynamic contribution to the shear in a
blade can be worked out analytically. Following the approach
of Manwell et al. (2009), which uses a one degree of freedom
rigid body model of a Ô¨Çapping blade, the shear tiof theith
rotor blade is found to be

t1cD NtNV: (8b)
These expressions state that there is a linear dependency be-
tween a pitch misalignment and the resulting harmonic dis-
turbances. In addition, the 1P imbalance harmonic t1cthat
‚Äì according to Eq. (5) ‚Äì causes the appearance of a 1P har-
monic in the Ô¨Åxed frame is proportional to the cross-Ô¨Çow.
Although in operation there will always be some small mis-
alignment between the rotor axis and the wind vector, this
expression suggests that the 1P signal could be strengthened
by operating at a slight yaw misalignment with the incoming
wind when detecting an imbalance and correcting for it.
A word of caution is due in the interpretation of these an-
alytical results. First of all, this analysis is based on the sole
thrust force, while terms other than the cross-Ô¨Çow contribute
to the 1P harmonic when considering yawing and nodding
moments. In addition, the model is the simplest possible us-
ing one single degree of freedom and including various sim-
pliÔ¨Åcations in the derivations. Nevertheless, the model is at
least useful in qualitatively understanding the basic mecha-
nisms by which Ô¨Åxed-frame vibrations are caused in an im-
balanced rotor. After having served its purpose, the analyticalmodel is dropped from the rest of the paper, the further de-
velopments of which are not based on it.
2.2 Linear imbalance‚Äìdisturbance model
In this work, an imbalance‚Äìdisturbance model is assumed in
the form
sDC(b bm); (9a)
DCbCsm: (9b)
The 1P harmonic amplitude vector of the Ô¨Åxed-frame mea-
sured signal sis noted sD(sc;ss)T, wherescandssare the
cosine and sine components, respectively. Considering here
and in the following the common case of a three-bladed rotor
(BD3), vector bD(b1;b2;b3)Tcontains the pitch adjust-
mentsbifor each one of the blades, while bmis the unknown
pitch misalignment. Equation (9a) states that, if one knew the
misalignment bm, then by pitching the blades by bDbmone
would obtain sD0; i.e., the rotor would be balanced. On the
other hand, before rebalancing, bD0 and hence, according
to Eq. (9b), one measures a 1P signal equal to smD Cbm.
In the model, the matrix of coefÔ¨Åcients Clinks imbalance
angles and 1P disturbances, and it is deÔ¨Åned as
CD/bracketleftbiggcc1cc2cc3
cs1cs2cs3/bracketrightbigg
: (10)
The model coefÔ¨Åcients Candsmare unknown. However,
they can be readily identiÔ¨Åed from measurements. Once the
model is known, one can use it to compute the pitch adjust-
ment bthat rebalances the rotor.
Note that the assumed imbalance‚Äìdisturbance model im-
plies a linear relationship between the pitch misalignment of
the blades and the 1P harmonic component of a measured re-
sponse signal (acceleration or load) in the Ô¨Åxed frame. As
shown later on, this assumption is not a limitation of the
model because in fact the model can be iteratively identi-
Ô¨Åed as the rotor is rebalanced, thus effectively removing the
linearity hypothesis. However, linearity is conÔ¨Årmed by the
previously derived simple analytical model, and it is indeed
generally also observed in extensive numerical simulations
conducted by using state-of-the-art aeroelastic models.
Since it is nearly impossible to guarantee that the whole
model identiÔ¨Åcation and rebalancing procedure will be con-
ducted in exactly the same wind conditions, it is important to
reduce the dependency of the model on the operating point.
To this end, the harmonic amplitude vector sin Eq. (9) is
scaled by the dynamic pressure

whereUais a moving average of the wind speed. The nondi-
mensionalization by qhas the effect of making the model
coefÔ¨Åcients Candsmlargely independent from the operat-
ing condition. In the turbulent examples reported later on,

the moving average was computed over 10 min. To avoid the
typical possible inaccuracies of nacelle-mounted anemome-
ters,Uamight be based on estimates of the rotor-equivalent
wind speed (Soltani et al., 2013).
To simplify the identiÔ¨Åcation of the model coefÔ¨Åcients, the
radial symmetry of the rotor can be exploited. Assuming a
periodic response, the effects of a misalignment in the second
blade will be the same as those caused by a misalignment in
the Ô¨Årst blade, but shifted by 2 =3. Hence, the model coefÔ¨Å-
cients must obey the following relationship:
/braceleftbigg
cc2cs2/bracerightbigg
D/bracketleftbigg
cos(2=3) sin(2=3)
 sin(2=3) cos(2=3)/bracketrightbigg/braceleftbigg
cc1cs1/bracerightbigg
DRc: (12)
Clearly, the same argument holds for the relationship be-
tween the response of blades two and three. Therefore, ma-
trixConly depends on the two coefÔ¨Åcients of vector cand
can be written as
CD/bracketleftbig
cRcR2c/bracketrightbig
: (13)
It is trivial to observe that this also implies the same relation-
ship between the coefÔ¨Åcients of blades three and one, thus
closing the loop.
The imbalance‚Äìdisturbance model might be affected by
proximity to resonant conditions or by the presence of vi-
bration control algorithms implemented onboard the turbine
control system. The Ô¨Årst problem is readily addressed by
avoiding identifying the model and rebalancing the machine
in the proximity of resonant conditions, which is easily done
since these are typically well known. The second problem
might require switching off these additional control loops
during identiÔ¨Åcation and rebalancing, although no general
statements are possible here and the situation would have to
be analyzed in detail for any speciÔ¨Åc implementation of such
algorithms.
2.3 Model identiÔ¨Åcation
Before computing the pitch adjustments that rebalance the
rotor, one needs to identify the unknown coefÔ¨Åcients in
Eq. (9b). To this end, it is convenient to rewrite the
imbalance‚Äìdisturbance model as follows:
sDCbCsm; (14a)
DBcCsm: (14b)
By simple algebraic derivations, one can readily show that
matrix Bis a sole function of the pitch adjustment band is
written as
BD/bracketleftbiggB11B12
 B12B11/bracketrightbigg
; (15)where
B11Db1Ccos(2=3)b2Ccos(4=3)b3; (16a)
B12Dsin(2=3)b2Csin(4=3)b3: (16b)
At the beginning of the procedure, one has not yet adjusted
the rotor pitch, and hence bDb(1)D0. In this condition, a
1P harmonic equal to s(1)is measured on the machine. Next,
the pitch of the blades is changed by a chosen amount b(2). In
order not to upset the operating condition of the machine, this
arbitrary pitch modiÔ¨Åcation should be characterized by a null
collective change. In correspondence to this new condition,
one measures a 1P harmonic equal to s(2). Considering the
two measurements s(1)ands(2)together, one can write
/braceleftbiggs(1)
s(2)/bracerightbigg
D/bracketleftbiggB(1)I
B(2)I/bracketrightbigg/braceleftbiggc
sm/bracerightbigg
; (17)
where B(1)andB(2)indicate matrix (15) evaluated in corre-
spondence to vectors b(1)andb(2), respectively. Inverting this
relationship, one readily obtains the unknown coefÔ¨Åcients c
andsm, which fully characterize Eq. (9b).
2.4 Rebalancing
Now that Eq. (9b) has been identiÔ¨Åed, it can be used to
rebalance the rotor. Before doing so, however, one should
note that only imbalances among the blades will produce a
1P harmonic in the Ô¨Åxed frame. In fact, a collective rota-
tion of all blades by any given angle will not produce any
imbalance, and therefore it cannot be detected by a method
based on Ô¨Åxed-frame response signals. This implies that one
cannot compute the full pitch adjustment vector b, but only
a zero-collective adjustment that satisÔ¨Åes the relationship/summationtext3
iD1biD0. This is also stated by Eq. (9b), which is in fact
a rectangular system of two equations in three unknowns.
By appending the zero-collective constraint to the
imbalance‚Äìdisturbance model, one gets
/braceleftbiggs
0/bracerightbigg
D/bracketleftbiggC
1T/bracketrightbigg
bC/braceleftbiggsm
0/bracerightbigg
; (18)
where 1D(1;1;1)T. Setting sD0, i.e., requesting a null 1P
harmonic response in the Ô¨Åxed frame, one readily computes
the necessary pitch adjustments as
bD /bracketleftbiggC
1T/bracketrightbigg 1/braceleftbiggsm
0/bracerightbigg
: (19)
Blades are now pitched by b, as computed by Eq. (19). If,
after application of the computed pitch adjustment, a 1P har-
monic is still detected in the Ô¨Åxed frame, then this might be
an indication of a non-exact linearity between pitch imbal-
ance and Ô¨Åxed-frame harmonic amplitude. In this case, one
can iterate the whole procedure. The measured amplitude in
the current conÔ¨Åguration becomes the new data point in the

796 M. Bertel√® et al.: Automatic pitch misalignment detection and correction
model identiÔ¨Åcation phase. This data point, together with the
one measured just before adjusting the blade pitch, allows for
the identiÔ¨Åcation of a new model. Given the new coefÔ¨Åcients,
the zero-collective constraint is appended to the model, the
inversion of which yields the new pitch adjustments. The pro-
cess is repeated until only a negligible 1P harmonic signal is
left in the Ô¨Åxed frame. Figure 2 gives a graphical representa-
tion of this algorithmic procedure.
Inspecting the values of the computed pitch adjustments
b, one may notice in some cases that two blades are char-
acterized by the same correction, for example b1Db26Db3.
This means that only one blade (number 3 in this speciÔ¨Åc ex-
ample) was misaligned with respect to the other two. In this
case, one might choose to change the blade pitch of blade
3 byb3 2b1, which has the effect of realigning blade 3
with the others instead of adjusting all three at null collec-
tive change. This might be useful, for example, in the case
that a blade has been mounted with the wrong pitch offset.
3 Results
3.1 Simulation environment
In this work, the proposed rebalancing procedure is demon-
strated with the help of aeroservoelastic simulations of a
3 MW horizontal axis wind turbine. The machine, character-
ized by an 80 m hub height and a rotor diameter of 93 m, has
cut-in, rated and cut-out speeds equal to 3, 12.5 and 25 m s 1,
respectively. The cut-in rotor speed is equal to 5.2 RPM,
whereas the rated rotor speed is equal to 15 RPM. Both side‚Äì
side and fore‚Äìaft tower frequencies are equal to 0.3 Hz. The
Ô¨Årst blade Ô¨Çap-wise frequency varies between 0.9 Hz at cut-
in and 1 Hz at rated rotor speed. Finally, the Ô¨Årst blade edge-
wise frequency is about 1.5 Hz. The transient response of the
machine is computed with the Ô¨Ånite-element multibody code
Cp-Lambda (Bottasso and Croce, 2006). The rotor blades
and tower are modeled using a geometrical exact beam for-
mulation (with torsion, axial, bending and shear deformabil-
ity), resulting in a nonlinear Ô¨Ånite-element model. The rest of
the wind turbine is modeled by a combination of rigid bod-
ies, joints and Ô¨Çexible elements to represent nacelle, drive-
train and foundations. Generator and pitch actuators are mod-
eled by Ô¨Årst- and second-order dynamical systems, respec-
tively. The classical blade element momentum theory (BEM)
is used to represent the aerodynamics, considering hub and
tip losses, dynamic stall, unsteady aerodynamics and rotor-
tower interference. A speed-scheduled linear quadratic regu-
lator (LQR) (Riboldi, 2012) is used for the implementation
of the pitch‚Äìtorque controller. Turbulent wind time histories
of 10 min duration are generated with the code TurbSim
(Jonkman and Kilcher, 2012) based on the Kaimal turbulence
model.
Different combinations of initial pitch misalignments in
the range2are considered, in which only one, two or even
all three blades are simultaneously misaligned. To model Ô¨Å-nite resolution effects in the pitch system, the minimum res-
olution of the pitch motion is assumed to be 0.1. There-
fore, any blade movement smaller than the given resolution is
rounded to the closest neighboring integer multiple. To quan-
tify the effectiveness of the rebalancing algorithm, the abso-
lute residual pitch misalignment angle is deÔ¨Åned as
Dmax( bm b) min(bm b); (20)
where bm bis the difference between real and computed
misalignments.
Accelerometers are placed on the machine main bearing,
with the goal of measuring the Ô¨Åxed-frame response of the
system, and they are simulated in the mathematical model in-
cluding the effects of measurement noise. Various tests were
conducted in order to identify an optimal accelerometer con-
Ô¨Åguration. Typically, the best results were obtained when two
accelerometers are located to the two sides of the main bear-
ing and spaced as far as possible from each other. The two ac-
celerometer signals are subtracted one from the other, yield-
ing a differential measurement proportional to the yawing ac-
celerations of the rotor.
3.2 Linearity
The model described in Sect. 2.2 is based on the assumption
that 1P harmonics in the Ô¨Åxed frame depend linearly on the
pitch misalignment angle. To validate this assumption, simu-
lations were performed to study the wind turbine Ô¨Åxed-frame
response to blade misalignments. The simulations were per-
formed in steady sheared wind conditions, misaligning one
blade at a time.
Figure 3 shows the sine and cosine differential acceler-
ation components at the main bearing for each one of the
three blades. The plots correspond to a wind condition of
7 m s 1, although similar results were obtained for different
wind speeds. Accelerations were scaled with respect to the
dynamic pressure and averaged over the simulation time. The
relationship between 1P response and pitch misalignment ap-
pears to be linear to a very good approximation, with the cor-
relation coefÔ¨Åcient of the linear best Ô¨Åts differing from 1 by
less that 10 3.
It is interesting to observe that the misalignment of each
different blade leaves a unique Ô¨Ångerprint on the measured
signal. This means that the linear model not only contains
information on the severity of the misalignment, but also on
where the misalignment is located.
3.3 Performance assessment of the rebalancing
algorithm
Next, the performance of the proposed algorithm is tested in
a variety of different wind conditions. The model expressed
by Eq. (17) is identiÔ¨Åed from accelerometer measurements
recorded in 10 min turbulent conditions, characterized by dif-
ferent values of air density, wind speed, turbulence inten-

quantities are assumed to change according to a number of
scenarios, termed series A through F, described in detail in
Appendix A. Once the model is identiÔ¨Åed, the rotor is re-balanced by inverting the model itself. The procedure of

1P harmonic is smaller than a given threshold.

conditions according to series A through D.
Figure 4 shows the absolute residual pitch misalignment
after each iteration of the rebalancing algorithm. The spe-
ciÔ¨Åc cases reported in the Ô¨Ågure correspond to situations in
which wind speed and TI are kept constant, whereas mean
values of yaw misalignment, vertical shear and upÔ¨Çow an-
gle vary throughout the identiÔ¨Åcation‚Äìrebalancing sequence
according to what is speciÔ¨Åed for series A through D.
In the Ô¨Ågure, the abscissa represents the various steps of
the procedure. At the beginning (step 0), a 1P acceleration is
measured in the Ô¨Åxed frame. Next, one or more blades are
randomly pitched (step 1), while keeping the collective con-
stant. In the resulting new conÔ¨Åguration, a new 1P accelera-
tion is measured. Since this step is random, the unbalance of
the blades may worsen in this Ô¨Årst step. The algorithm is now
applied by Ô¨Årst identifying the model and then computing the
pitch adjustment bthat rebalances the rotor. The blades are
then accordingly pitched (step 2). If a residual 1P harmonic
is still present, the algorithm is applied again using data from
steps 1 and 2, resulting in a new pitch adjustment (step 3).
The procedure is repeated until convergence.
The Ô¨Ågure shows that the proposed algorithm is capable of
rebalancing the rotor in a very small number of steps, typi-
cally ranging between three and four. It should be noted that
during each one of these steps, the machine is operating in
markedly different operating conditions, as described by the
series reported in the Appendix. Notwithstanding these very
signiÔ¨Åcant operational changes, the procedure seems to be
quite robust.
An important remark is due at this point. As wind condi-
tions may change from one step to the next, in general it is
not possible to guarantee that the imbalance will always di-
minish at each step of the algorithm. Indeed, some of the
following numerical experiments show that the imbalance
may occasionally increase. However, this happens only in the
case of radical changes in wind conditions from one step to
the next. It would be relatively straightforward to avoid such

situations by implementing some simple logic in the proce-
dure. For example, one might monitor the operating param-
eters and continue with rebalancing only when changes do
not exceed a certain threshold. In addition, if one observes
an increase in the 1P harmonic amplitude after a rebalancing
step, then that step might be rejected and the blades could
be pitched back to their previous setting. To consider a worst
case scenario, in all numerical experiments presented here
these simple precautions were not taken. Therefore, the al-
gorithm was forced to continue irrespective of the severity
of operating changes. Because of this, the results show oc-
casional increases in the imbalance throughout the iterations.
Nevertheless, these same results also show that the algorithm
was always eventually able to successfully rebalance the ro-
tor in a very small number of steps.
Figure 5 reports results obtained at different TI levels for
cases characterized by changes in wind speed from 7 to
15 m s 1and in density from 1.225 to 1.1 kg m 3for series E
and F. For the E series results, the situation temporarily wors-
ens between steps 1 and 2. This may be due to the simulta-
neous change in air density, yaw misalignment and halving
the shear from 0.4 to 0.2 in this step. Here again, very vari-
able inÔ¨Çow conditions do not seem to excessively affect the
performance of the algorithm, which is indeed able to com-
pletely rebalance the turbine rotor within four steps.
3.4 Effects of measurement noise
The effects of noise on the measurement of the accelera-
tions driving the algorithm were then investigated. In fact,
small imbalances induce only small 1P harmonics in the
Ô¨Åxed frame so that the effects of noise on the measurements
can be signiÔ¨Åcant.
Measurement noise is modeled by adding a white
Gaussian signal to the accelerations measured on the
multibody wind turbine model. Five different signal-

to-noise ratios (SNRs) are considered, namely SNR D
T5 15 22 26 30UdB. To obtain statistically relevant results, for
each SNR six different random noise realizations are used,
and the results are then averaged.
In addition to acceleration noise, the study also consid-
ered the effects of errors in the measurement of the average
wind speedUaof Eq. (11), used for scaling the imbalance
harmonic amplitudes. Such errors might be due to the well-
known poor accuracy of nacelle-mounted anemometers. Re-
sults are not reported here for space limitations, but even er-
rors of20 % did not signiÔ¨Åcantly affect the performance of
the proposed algorithm.
3.4.1 Nonturbulent wind conditions
To separate the effects of measurement noise from the
stochastic disturbances caused by turbulence, series com-
posed of 3 min long nonturbulent wind conditions are con-
sidered Ô¨Årst.
Figure 6 shows the average residual pitch misalignment
for different SNRs for a case in which all wind parameters
are constant and wind speed is equal to 11 m s 1. The results
clearly illustrate the detrimental effects of decreasing SNR
values on the quality of the rebalancing. For SNR D5 dB,
the residualconverges to about 0.35, which is neverthe-
less a good result considering that in this particular case the
initial imbalance was of 1.5. Increasing SNR, the resid-
ual misalignment improves as expected, showing that, from
SNR22 dB and higher, converges to values smaller than
0.1(which is the assumed minimum resolution of the pitch
system, and therefore past this value differences among the
SNR levels become irrelevant).
Figure 7 shows results obtained in varying wind condi-
tions. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, wind speed and density change respec-
tively from 11 to 15 m s 1and from 1.1 to 1.225 kg m 3,
while vertical shear and misalignment angles vary according
to series G. Here again a temporary worsening of the rotor

G).
balancing can be observed between step 2 and 3, probably
due to the halving of shear between these two steps, accom-
panied by simultaneous substantial increases in air density
and wind speed.
It appears that the method very effectively reduces the ini-
tial misalignments. Indeed, results show a very modest effect
of SNR, except for the lowest value of 5 dB that seems to
take a bit longer to converge. The apparently surprising lack
of sensitivity to SNR can be explained by the changing yaw
misalignment within the steps. Indeed, as shown in Eq. (8b),
the 1P harmonic measured in the Ô¨Åxed frame is related to the
presence of a cross-Ô¨Çow component. Therefore, a bit of mis-
alignment of the rotor axis with respect to the wind vector
eases rebalancing because it makes the effects of an unbal-
ance more prominent and therefore less affected by noise.
3.4.2 Turbulent wind conditions
Figure 8 shows the same simulation series as in Fig. 7 (i.e.,
wind speed and density changing from 11 to 15 m s 1and
from 1.1 to 1.225 kg m 3, respectively, with other wind pa-
rameters according to series G), but for a turbulent inÔ¨Çow
characterized by TID5 %. Here again it appears that SNRs
larger than 22 dB have very little effect on the speed of con-
vergence of the algorithm.
It is also interesting to observe that convergence is actually
faster in turbulent conditions (Fig. 8) than in nonturbulent
ones (Fig. 7). This may be due again to the fact that turbu-
lence implies a higher excitation of the 1P harmonic, making
it more evident against the sensor noise.
A large number of tests performed in additional operat-
ing conditions and SNR values conÔ¨Årm the Ô¨Åndings reported
herein. Clearly, one should choose a sensor with the highest
SNR possible in the frequency range of interest. However,
these results suggest that even fairly limited values of SNR
should typically be sufÔ¨Åcient for the algorithm to completely
rebalance a rotor in turbulent and varying wind conditions.

4 Conclusions
This paper has described a new method to detect and correct
pitch imbalances in wind turbine rotors. The method uses a
measured signal in the Ô¨Åxed frame, typically in the form of
accelerations or loads. The signal is demodulated to extract
the 1P harmonic, which is then related to the misalignment
of the blades by a linear model. By exploiting the axial sym-
metry of the rotor, the phase of the signal is used to detect
which blades are unbalanced. The use of the rotor axial sym-
metry has the additional effect of reducing the number of free
parameters in the model to only two.
The model parameters are readily identiÔ¨Åed by measuring
the signal and computing its harmonics at two different pitch
settings, something that is easily achieved by simply pitching
the blades by a small chosen amount. The procedure can be
performed while the machine is in operation, without shut-
ting it down. The method also works if measurements are
taken at different operating conditions, which is indeed in-
evitable in the Ô¨Åeld. Once the model has been identiÔ¨Åed, its
inversion readily yields the pitch adjustments of the various
blades that rebalance the rotor. If, after rebalancing, some re-
maining 1P harmonic is detected, the whole procedure can
be repeated, thereby eliminating the effects of possible small
nonlinearities in the imbalance‚Äìdisturbance relationship. The
whole approach has fairly minimal requirements, as it only
assumes the availability of a sensor of sufÔ¨Åcient accuracy and
bandwidth to detect the 1P harmonic to the desired precision
and the ability to command the pitch setting of each blade
independently from the others.
Extensive numerical simulations were conducted with the
proposed procedure using a detailed aeroservoelastic model
of a multi-MW wind turbine. The analysis considered real-
istic scenarios in which measurements and rebalancing were
performed in operating conditions characterized by varying
air density, wind speed, yaw misalignment, upÔ¨Çow, shearand turbulence intensity. The simulation environment also
considered the modeling of measurement noise and distur-
bances.
Based on the results presented herein, the following con-
clusions may be drawn.
‚ÄìThe relationship between pitch imbalance and 1P Ô¨Åxed-
frame harmonics appears to be linear and unique de-
pending on the location of the misalignment. This al-
lows one to not only quantify the severity of the imbal-
ance, but also the unbalanced blade(s).
‚ÄìIn realistic wind conditions, i.e., with turbulent wind
and variable air density, speed, vertical shear and wind
rotor angles, the proposed algorithm successfully rebal-
ances the rotor typically within four iterations. To ac-
count for possible changes in the mean value of wind
speed and/or density, the simple scaling of the 1P input
by the dynamic pressure was sufÔ¨Åcient to guarantee a
good performance in all tested conditions.
‚ÄìGiven the relatively small magnitude of the signals that
are generated by small misalignments of the blades, one
might expect that particular attention should to be paid
to the selection of the installed sensors. However, results
have shown that measurements are rather insensitive to
SNR. Indeed, values of SNR 30 dB in the frequency
range of interest are more than adequate for the present
application, although even a signiÔ¨Åcantly smaller value
of SNR gives only a slight performance degradation.
However, one should keep in mind that different results
might have been obtained on different wind turbines and
when placing the sensors at different locations than the
ones considered here.
‚ÄìGood results were obtained by using observation win-
dows of 10 min. Although longer time windows might
appear to be beneÔ¨Åcial to smooth out Ô¨Çuctuations due to
turbulence and noise, one should also consider that long
time windows might also imply signiÔ¨Åcant changes not
only in the operating conditions, but also in rotor speed,
which should also be duly accounted for.
Notwithstanding the very promising results obtained here
in a simulation environment, a demonstration in the Ô¨Åeld re-
mains indispensable to prove the actual effectiveness and ap-
plicability of the proposed method in practice. Finally, fu-
ture studies should consider the case of simultaneous aero-
dynamic and mass imbalances.
