I.  INTRODUCTION   
In order to fulfill the growing energy demand, the 
renewable energy sources gained attention towards it. These are 
sustainable energy sources and facilitates an alternative 
solution other non -sustainable energy sources such as coal, 
fossil fuel and nuclear power. Among various sustainable 
energy elements like biomass, geothermal, hydro, solar and 
tidal, w ind energy is accounted as one of the fast depleting, 
pollution free energy source  [1]. Wind power energy 
association of America in its recent survey made by 2019, the 
wind energy is positioned first as because it’s a no -emission 
energy source.  
Our country  ranked fourth in the highest wind power 
installed capacity. The government of India leverages tax and 
ready to waive few percentages in the total cost of new wind 
farm installation project. In general, wind farm installed with 
wind turbines converts the m echanical energy into an electrical 
energy. The size of the wind farm depends on the number of 
wind turbines and its coverage of distribution. There are two types of wind farms commonly known as onshore and offshore. 
The challenges associated with wind far m are, 
• Identifying the potential location for installation  
• Maintaining the equipment health of the wind mill  
• Forecasting the energy production accurately  
With the help of modern technologies, it is possible to 
address the above mentioned challenges relate d to wind park. 
The primary objective of the proposed work is to provide 
complete solution to wind park issues listed above.  
According to the information observed from the Ministry of 
New and Renewable Energy, Government of India, our country 
is positionin g fourth place in the highest wind installed 
capacity. The statistical report on 31st March 2019, India 
generated 35.6 GW and produced 52.66 billion units (BU) in 
the duration of 2017 -2018. Tamil Nadu contributed 33799.65 
MW power generations all over the India and it has the 
installed capacity in locations like Gudimangalam, Kayathar, 
Kanyakumari and Tripur. The government is continuously 
encouraging the projects in this streamline to effectively

accumulated power generation  [2].  
In order to serve the need for wind power generation in 
Tamil Nadu, the proposed system attempts to facilitate smart 
wind farm design which forecasts energy production by 
calculating the wind energy parameters such as its speed, 
direction including the turbine characteristics like blade and 
rotor specification. The proposed model also uses deep learning 
techniques to predict promising power generation capacity in 
that area in near future as short term as day wise. The 
chara cteristics of the smart wind farm design are as follows:  
• Accuracy  
• Access friendly  
• Environment friendly  
• Faster  
• Reliable  
• Secure  
The article's remaining sections are organized as follows: 
The related research done in this field was examined in section 
2. Addi tionally, the research gap and real -world applications 
are noted. The architecture of the IoT based wind farm  is 
described in section 3. The deep learning classifier is further 
developed. Section 4 discusses the classifier's performance, and 
Section 5 conc ludes the study.  
II. LITERATURE REVIEW  
In this section,  remarkable  contributions made by various 
researchers in obtaining effective solutions to wind farm  are 
detailed.  
A. Related Work  
Lina Alhmoud et al. [ 3] proposed an IoT application to 
improve the reliability  issues related to wind turbines. He 
conducted literature survey to bring difference between IoT and 
cyber physical systems, to obtain the various hardware and 
software platforms for the successful implementation, also 
provided the scope for wind energy co nversion system  (WECS)  
in near future. In order to enable sustainable operation of the 
wind farm, it is necessary to maintain the reliability of the wind 
turbine. The proposed model developed an IoT device to 
monitor the quality of the turbines integratin g fog computing 
with Thingspeak cloud service.  
Mohammed Noor -A-Rahim et al. [4 ] contributed their 
significant effort in ensuring the reliability of wind turbine state 
by devising an IoT based communication framework. The 
framework attempted to facilitate reliable wireless connection 
exists between sensory network of turbines and control center 
using a fusion algorithm. Further it designed a repeat -
accumulate mode of communication to ensure reliability.  
Ersin Akyüz et al. [5 ] devised a cloud assisted IoT 
prototype to enable remote monitoring of wind turbines. The proposed work selected the wind speed, direction, voltage and 
battery current as its primary attributes and the acquired data 
are collected through a data logger designed for it. Furthermore 
Microso ft Azure which is a cloud platform availed the storage 
and analysis functions for the system. It utilized the Power BI 
software to project the results in a more appealing manner over 
mobile devices.  Edison prabhu et al. [6 ] proposed IoT enabled 
fault diagn osis system for wind turbines by placing the relevant 
sensors over the blade, bearing, generator and rotor to assess its 
healthiness.  
Fran lizza et al. [7 ] designed an IoT based remote 
monitoring solution to assess the status of the wind turbines. 
The prop osed model utilized the universal asynchronous 
receiver/transmitter (UART) to bridge between IoT device and 
control relay.  The significant efforts for an IoT based wind mill 
monitoring to diagnosis the fault are captured [8 -12]. 
Stanly Wilson and Kirubanan d [13] addressed the data 
collection strategies for wind turbine management.  The IoT 
based energy management system for wind employing 
microgrids was inherently investigated in [14 -16]. The 
significance of wind power system and study on optimizing the 
powe r is conducted in [17 & 18].  
Kalvagadda Lohit Reddy et al. [20] implemented IoT based 
wind energy management system with fuzzy logic.  Muhammad 
Shahzad Nazir et al. [21 ] explored the existing anemometers 
and it technological characteristics and discussed t he scope for 
ANN based techniques in wind power prediction in his article. 
It revealed that ANN based approaches were estimated to 
contribute 38% in forecasting operations, 29% in fault 
diagnosis, 23% in control activities and 10% in designing 
forums.   
Tayeb Brahimi [22 ] developed a power prediction module 
for WECS. In this work, artificial neural network (ANN) 
algorithms were used to estimate the power generation based 
on the meteorological data from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
When comparing the test re sults with other artificial 
intelligence techniques like support vector machines (SVM), 
random tree and random forest, random tree outperformed the 
ANN based mechanisms.  
Fei Chen et al. [23 ] designed a sensor fault diagnostic and 
control system in order t o maximize the capacity of power 
generation in WECS. His work investigated the applicability of 
deep learning techniques in arriving accurate prediction. The 
simulation results of this model proved with higher accuracy 
and efficiency in terms of response t ime.  
Dr. A. K. Parvathy from Hindustan Institute of Technology 
and Science contributed significant effort in obtaining real time 
energy management mechanisms deployed under smart home 
environment through optimizing the cluster of prosumers.

IJRITC C | June 2023 , Available @ http://www.ijritcc.org  B. Research Objec tives  
The primary objectives are as follows:  
1. To build smart wind farm module employing 
appropriate sensors as IoT edge devices  
2. To predict and monitor the health of the installed wind 
turbine remotely  
3. To enable short term wind power prediction over the 
data observed with IoT module empowering with deep 
learning mechanisms . 
III. PROPOSED SYSTEM  
The modules for implementing the suggested system are 
broken down and covered in more detail below.   
A. Obtaining a novel design of anemometer  
The proposed system is to prom ote the power of existing 
WECS by regular monitoring of the wind turbines and 
predicting the power generation in advance with the help of a 
promising design of anemometer with low energy 
consumption. The popular anemometers in market and 
proposed as protot ypes along with its characteristics are 
presented as table 1 as below .

Market  
 
With the influence obtained from existing efforts towards 
anemometer design, the proposed work decided to design a 
novel compact sensor which measures the both wind speed 
and direction together. T o attain speed and direction of the 
wind with ultra -low level energy consumption, a 6 -axis 
accelerator or gyroscope is elected and the same encapsulated 
within a spherical surface. Thus the novel anemometer 
determines the wind speed based on the accelerati ons of the 
sensor surface. The predominant components of the proposed 
anemometer are BMI270 IMU accelerator, a 3D printed 
spherical sensor case, the mounting structure an d the same is 
projected as F igure 1.  
 
 
 
Figure 1.  Cut-through view of novel anemometer . 
In conn ection with wind speed calculation, the wind force 
applied over the sensor is to be determined. The wind speed 
can be calculated by measuring the wind force exerted on the 
sensor case and the formula to obtai n the same is given as 
equation 1.

Where F(t) – Wind force; A - Area of the contact surface; μ 
– geometry shape of the surface; ρ – Density of the air which 
is a constant value 1.226 kg/m; V(t) – Speed of wind with 
time. Further the expressions with respect to forces over the 
degree of freed om (DOF) of the surfaces are expressed as 
equations 2 and 3 respectively.

The effect of accelerations over the DOF of sensor surface 
is portrayed as figure 2 and the relevant notations to capture 
the change of accelerations as equations 4 and 5 respectively.

B. Developing a IoT prototype for smart wind farm  
An Io T based prototype for the p roposed WECS is 
illustrated as F igure 3 . 
 
Figure 3.  The proposed IoT prototype for wind farm . It is designed by carefully deriving the significant 
attributes contributing the real time m onitoring and power 
gener ation module of the wind farm. The proposed prototype 
enriched with the compact anemometer developed in this 
previous module for determining the wind speed and direction 
effectively instead of deploying relevant sensor available in  
the commercial market. S imply by integrating all the sensors, 
establishing a communication among the same for data 
exchange enables the working prototype of the proposed smart 
wind farm . 
C. Accommodating deep learning practices  
The previous attempts clearly envisioned that in the 
process of predicting wind power, the ANN based approaches 
were utilized. The deep learning algorithms like convolutional 
neural network (ConvNets / CNN) gained attention recently 
because of its efficiency in mapping historical and t ime series 
data within a minimal execution time period. The steps in 
CNN proposed for predicting wind power is depicted as Figure

IJRITC C | June 2023 , Available @ http://www.ijritcc.org  Furth ermore to improve the performance the cuckoo 
optimization algorithm is  applied herewith. The Cuckoo 
Search Algorithm (CSA) has been used in various areas to 
optimise the solution in accordance with the statistical data. 
Image processing, pattern recognitio n, software testing, data 
mining, cyber security, cloud computing, Int ernet of Things, 
etc. are some of the main areas where CSA implements.  
 A recently created meta -heuristic optimization approach 
called Cuckoo Search is employed to resolve optimization 
issues. This meta -heuristic algorithm, which draws inspiration 
from nat ure, is based on Levy flights random walks and the 
brood parasitism of some cuckoo species. The process flow of 
cuckoo optimization is presented as Table 2.  
TABLE II.  ALGORITHMIC STEPS IN CUCKOO  OPTIMIZATION    
1: Initialize habitats of cuckoo by assigning random  
values to profit function  
2: Dedicate some eggs to each cuckoo  
3: Estimate ELR for each cuckoo as in Equation (8)  
4: Let cuckoos to lay eggs within the ELR limit  
5: Kill those eggs that are recognized  by host birds  
6: Let eggs hatch and chicks grow  
7: Evaluate the habitat of e ach newly grown cuckoo  
8: Limit cuckoos’ maximum number in environment and  
kill those who live in worst habitats  
9: Cluster cuckoos and find best group and select goal 
habitat  
10: Let new cuckoo  population immigrate toward goal 
habitat  
11: If condition is satisfied sto p, else go to step 2  
 
To obtain the egg laying radius (ELR) which is ration of 
the total number of eggs laid and number of eggs available at 
present scenario, first set the maximum and  minimum limit of 
egg laying capacity of the cuckoo like Var max and Var min 
respectively with α - a numeric value used to adjust the 
maximum limit of ELR. The mathematical notation to 
calculate the ELR is expressed as equation 8.

A. Execution Platform  
The performance of the proposed deep learning model is 
assessed using the Tensor  Flow 2.0 execution environment. It 
was developed as an open source by Google. Developers have 
favored  it as a solution because it is so easily available. The 
system requirements to conduct deep lear ning experiments in 
the Tensor  Flow env ironment are outlined in Table 3 .

Figure 5.  Comparative analysis of wind energy prediction  against proposed deep model . 
The proposed model (CNN with Cuckoo Optimization) is 
evaluated agains t important machine learning techniques such 
as CNN, LSTM, and SVM. The major objective is to a ssess 
how close the model's predictions come to the actual values 
that were observed. As a result, a high RMSE is "bad" and a 
low RMSE is "excellent". The differ ence between the observed 
and anticipated values is represented by the residual in the 
formula.  The mean squared error (MSE) is the sum of all 
squared residuals. The measure is then reset to the scale of the 
response variable by taking the RMSE's square ro ot. The most 
accurate graphic representation of the many techniques used to 
estimate the classi fier for wind energy prediction is shown in 
Figure 5. It is clear that the proposed model is meant to yield 
better results than existing methods utilized for com parative 
analysis.  The findings make it abundantly evident that the 
proposed deep  model  (Opt-CNN) was judged to have a 
relatively small erro r rate, one that ranges from 0.3 to 0.5  at 
best. 
V. CONCLUSION  
Without relying on conventional fuel technology, wind 
power has a significant pot ential to provide green energy. In 
order to prolong the lifespan of th eir electro -mechanical 
elements, wind turbines require routine, proactive maintenance. 
In this work IoT prototype for smart wind farm is discussed. 
Moreover, a n ovel anemometer design  and its efficacy  are 
elaborated . After completing the required pre -proce ssing 
activities, such as cleaning, noise removal, and feature 
extraction, the selected dataset is ready for classification. In 
order to wind energy, a deep lear ning system an optimized 
CNN is then applied to the data. It lists a 98.72% accuracy rate. The model's predicted error rate is discovered to be less than 
0.5, indicating that it is a "good" model.  
For further deep learning model realization over the 
benefi ciaries, a mobile application can be created.
