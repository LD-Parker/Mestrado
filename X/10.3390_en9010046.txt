Abstract: Nowadays offshore wind energy is the renewable energy source with the highest growth.
Offshore wind farms are composed of large and complex wind turbines, requiring a high level
of reliability, availability, maintainability and safety (RAMS). Firms are employing robust remote
condition monitoring systems in order to improve RAMS, considering the difﬁculty to access the
wind farm. The main objective of this research work is to optimise the maintenance management of
wind farms through the fault probability of each wind turbine. The probability has been calculated
by Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) employing the Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) in order to reduce the
computational cost. The fault tree presented in this paper has been designed and validated based
on qualitative data from the literature and expert from important European collaborative research
projects. The basic events of the fault tree have been prioritized employing the criticality method
in order to use resources efﬁciently. Exogenous variables, e.g., weather conditions, have been also
considered in this research work. The results provided by the dynamic probability of failure and the
importance measures have been employed to develop a scheduled maintenance that contributes to
improve the decision making and, consequently, to reduce the maintenance costs.

1. Introduction
The renewable energy industry is in continuous development to achieve the energy framework
targets established by governments [ 1]. Nowadays, the most developed countries are focused on
improving the technology for offshore wind energy. The main advantages of the offshore wind farms
are [2]:
- The wind power captured by wind turbines (WTs) is more than onshore.
- The size of offshore wind farms can be larger than onshore.
- The environmental impact for offshore is less than in onshore.
The main disadvantages are:
- It is more complex to evaluate the wind characteristics.
- Larger investment costs. The offshore installation cost is 1.44 million  /MW, where the onshore
is 0.78 million  /MW [3].
- Operation and maintenance (O & M) tasks are more complex and expensive than onshore. The
offshore O & M costs tasks are from 18% to 23% of the total system costs, being 12% for onshore
wind farms [4].

The objective of this paper is to develop a novel maintenance management approach in order to
establish a proper strategy for the maintenance task by using a predictive maintenance method based
on statistical studies. This approach provides information about the WTs with high fault probability, a
ranking of components of WTs to repair or replace according to the state of the system over the time,
and when those maintenance tasks must be carried out. An adequate maintenance planning to ensure
the right operation of an offshore wind farm is required. For this purpose, different techniques and
methods of condition monitoring (CM) are employed for detection and diagnosis of faults of WTs [ 5].
Most of the research papers consider the CM in WTs referred to blades [ 6], gearboxes [ 7], electrical or
electronic components [ 8] and tower [ 9]. CM leads to improve RAMS and to increase the productivity
of wind farms.
2. CM Applied to WT
The main components of WTs are illustrated in Figure 1. WTs are usually three-blade units [ 10].
Once the wind drives the blades, the energy is transmitted via the main shaft through the gearbox to
the generator. At the top of the tower, assembled on a base or foundation, the housing or nacelle is
mounted and the alignment with the direction of the wind is controlled by a yaw system. There is a
pitch system in each blade. This mechanism controls the wind power and sometimes is employed as
an aerodynamic brake. Finally, there is a meteorological unit that provides information about the wind
(speed and direction) to the control system.

establish  a proper strategy for the maintenance  task by using a predictive  maintenance  method based 
on statistical  studies. This approach  provides  information  about the WTs with high fault probability,

WTs [5]. Most of the research papers consider  the CM in WTs referred to blades [6], gearboxes  [7], 
electrical  or electronic  components  [8] and tower [9]. CM leads to improve RAMS and to increase the 
productivity  of wind farms. 
2. CM Applied  to WT 
The main components  of WTs are illustrated  in Figure 1. WTs are usually three‐blade units [10]. 
Once the wind drives the blades, the energy is transmitted  via the main shaft through the gearbox to 
the generator.  At the top of the tower, assembled  on a base or foundation,  the housing or nacelle is 
mounted  and the alignment  with the direction  of the wind is controlled  by a yaw system. There is a 
pitch system in each blade. This mechanism  controls the wind power and sometimes  is employed  as 
an aerodynamic  brake. Finally, there is a meteorological  unit that provides  information  about the 
wind (speed and direction)  to the control system.

CM systems are composed  of different types of sensors and signal processing  equipment  applied 
on the main components  of WTs such as blades, gearboxes,  generators,  bearings and towers. The choice 
and location of the right type and number of sensors are a key factor. The acquisition  of accurate data 
is critical to determine  the occurrence  of a fault and to address the solution to apply. Nowadays,  
different techniques  are available  for CM: vibration  analysis [3,11], acoustic emission  [3,12], ultrasonic  
testing techniques  [13,14], oil analysis [15], thermography  [3,13] and other methods  [16]. 
The first step of the CM process is the choice of an adequate  technique  for data acquisition,  
including  electronic  signals with the measurement  of the required  conditions,  e.g., sound, vibration,  
voltage, temperature,  speed. Then, a correct signal processing  method is applied, e.g., fast Fourier 
transform,  wavelet transforms,  hidden Markov models, statistical  methods  and trend analysis.  Fault 
detection  and diagnosis  (FDD) involves both CM techniques  and the signal processing  methods.

CM systems are composed of different types of sensors and signal processing equipment applied
on the main components of WTs such as blades, gearboxes, generators, bearings and towers. The
choice and location of the right type and number of sensors are a key factor. The acquisition of accurate
data is critical to determine the occurrence of a fault and to address the solution to apply. Nowadays,
different techniques are available for CM: vibration analysis [ 3,11], acoustic emission [ 3,12], ultrasonic
testing techniques [13,14], oil analysis [15], thermography [3,13] and other methods [16].
The ﬁrst step of the CM process is the choice of an adequate technique for data acquisition,
including electronic signals with the measurement of the required conditions, e.g., sound, vibration,
voltage, temperature, speed. Then, a correct signal processing method is applied, e.g., fast Fourier
transform, wavelet transforms, hidden Markov models, statistical methods and trend analysis. Fault
detection and diagnosis (FDD) involves both CM techniques and the signal processing methods.
The frequency of occurrence, i.e., the probability of failure, of an event is necessary to study in
order to improve the application of CMS for WTs [ 17]. This paper employed the Fault Tree Analysis
(FTA) technique to calculate the probability of failure of the WT. FTA is a graphical representation of
logical relationships between events. A Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) has been used to provide an

alternative to the traditional technique in order to reduce the computational cost. BDD is an approach
that determines the probability of failure of a system by examining the probability of failure of the
components. The BDD method does not analyses the FTA directly. The Boolean equation represents
the main event to analyse, e.g., the wind turbine failure, and it is obtained by BDDs that come from the
fault tree. The ordering algorithm for the construction of the BDD has a crucial effect on its size, and
therefore the computational cost. The algorithms are heuristics, and this is the reason that in this paper
has been considered several in order to compare the results, being: Top-down-left-right, Depth First
Search, AND, Breath First Search, and Level.
Finally, in order to optimize the resources, e.g., human, material, economic resources, etc., proper
and accurate prioritization of the basic events, based on importance measurement, has been done
according to the criticality method [ 18]. The information provided by the aforementioned method
leads to establish an optimal maintenance management for offshore wind farms, considering both
endogenous and exogenous variables.
3. FTA and BDD
A Fault Tree (FT) is a graphical structure formed by the causes of a certain type of failure mode
(Top Event) and the failure mode of the components (basic events) connected by logical operators such
as AND/OR gates [ 19]. The probability vector prepresents the failure probabilities of the basic events
qi,iP{1, . . . , n}, being nthe total number of events [20,21].
Then, the system failure probability Qsyscan be obtained via FTA according to q:
q
q1
...
qn

Complex systems analysis produce thousands of combinations of events (minimal cut sets) that
would cause the failure of the system and are used in the calculation of Qsys[21]. The determination
of these minimal cut sets can be a large and time-consuming process, even on modern high speed
computers. When the FT has many minimal cut sets, the determination of the exact failure probability
of the top event also requires a high calculation costs. For many complex FTs, this requirement may be
beyond the capability of the available computers. Therefore, some approximation techniques have
been introduced with a loss of accuracy.
The BDD method does not analyze the FT directly. The conversion of the FT to a BDD make
possible to calculate the probability of the top event by determining the Boolean equation of the top
event. The conversion process from FT to BDD presents several problems, e.g., the ordering scheme
chosen for the construction of the BDD has a crucial effect on its resulting size. A wrong ordering
scheme may result in large BDD that presents high computational costs [ 19]. In order to improve
the resource deployment in an existing system, proper and accurate ranking of the basic events is
necessary [ 23,24]. Some prioritizations of the basic events of the FT have been considered in this paper.
For further details of FTA and ranking methods, consultation of references [ 18,25] is recommended.
BDDs have been successfully used in the literature as an efﬁcient way to simulate FTs. BDDs were
introduced by Lee [ 26], and further popularized by Akers [ 27], Moret [ 25] and Bryant [ 22]. These
decision diagrams are composed by a data structure that can represent a Boolean function [28].
A BDD is a directed acyclic graph representation ( V,N), with vertex set Vand index set N, of a
Boolean function where equivalent Boolean sub-expressions are uniquely represented [ 29]. A directed
acyclic graph is a directed graph, i.e., to each vertex vthere is no possible directed path that starts and
ﬁnishes in v. It is composed of some interconnected nodes with two vertices. Each vertex is possible to
be a terminal or non-terminal vertex. Each single variable has two branches: 0-branch corresponds to
the cases where the variable has not occur and it is graphically represented by a dashed line (Figure 2);
on the other hand, 1-branch cases are those where the event is being carried out and corresponds to

the occurrence of the variable, and it is represented by a solid line (Figure 2). It allows to obtain an
analytical expression depending on the probability of failure of the basic events and the topology of
the FT. Paths starting from the top event to a terminal 1 provide a state in which the top event will
occur. These paths are named cut sets.

basic events and the topology  of the FT. Paths starting from the top event to a terminal 1 provide a 
state in which the top event will occur. These paths are named cut sets.

ITE (If‐Then‐Else) conditional  expression  is employed  in this research work as an approach  for 
the BDD’s cornerstones,  based on the approach  presented  in reference  [30]. Figure 2 shows an 
example of an ite done in a BDD that is described  as: “If event A occurs, Then f1, Else f2” [31].  
The solid line always belongs to the ones and the dashed lines to the zeros, explained  above.

The size of the BDD, equivalent  to CPU runtime,  has a strong dependence  on the ordering  of the 
events. Different  ranking methods  can be used in order to reduce the number of cut sets, and 
consequently,  to reduce the computational  runtime.  Note that there is no method that provides  the 
minimum  size of BDD in all cases. The following  methods  have been considered  in this paper:  
Top‐down‐left‐right, Depth First Search, AND, Breath First Search, and Level. The AND method has 
chosen for ranking the events because it provides  the best results in this case. For further information  
about BDDs readers are recommended  to see references  [20,22,26,27].  
The quantitative  analysis also takes into account the importance  of each basic event within the 
global system. With this purpose,  different  importance  measures  (IMs) are considered  in this paper. 
IMs are used in reliability  and risk analysis to quantifying  the impact of single component  on a system 
failure [32]. In order to determine  the importance  of a component,  it is necessary  to consider  all the 
related basic events as a group [33]. A complete  importance  analysis of all groups is therefore  
impractical  for large systems,  and it is necessary  to focus on the most important  groups of 
components  [34]. In this work Birnbaum  and Criticality  IMs are presented.  
Birnbaum  IM introduced,  for an event k, a measure of importance  based on the fault probability  
of the system caused by the failure of the component  k [35]. The priority of the event k is given by its 
Birnbaum  IM and is calculated  as follows: 
ܫ௞஻௜௥௡ൌ߲ܳ௦௬௦
ݍ߲௞ 
where ݍ௞ is the failure probability  assigned  to the k event, and ܳ௦௬௦ is the probability  of the top 
event. A drawback  related to the Birnbaum  IM is that it does not consider  the failure probability  of 
the k event and, therefore,  a high importance  can be assigned  to rare events. 
Criticality  IM [18], in contrast to Birnbaum,  takes into account the failure probability  of a certain 
component.  It rectifies the drawback  presented  in Birnbaum  IM, balancing  the values obtained.  It is 
defined as:

is the top event probability.  Criticality  IM provides  a different  perspective  than the Birnbaum  IM, 
even though both are connected  providing  a measurement  of the criticality  of each components.

ITE (If-Then-Else) conditional expression is employed in this research work as an approach for
the BDD’s cornerstones, based on the approach presented in reference [ 30]. Figure 2 shows an example
of an ite done in a BDD that is described as: “If event Aoccurs, Then f1, Else f2” [31]. The solid line
always belongs to the ones and the dashed lines to the zeros, explained above.
The following expression is obtained from Figure 2, considering Shannon’s theorem:

The size of the BDD, equivalent to CPU runtime, has a strong dependence on the ordering of
the events. Different ranking methods can be used in order to reduce the number of cut sets, and
consequently, to reduce the computational runtime. Note that there is no method that provides
the minimum size of BDD in all cases. The following methods have been considered in this paper:
Top-down-left-right, Depth First Search, AND, Breath First Search, and Level. The AND method has
chosen for ranking the events because it provides the best results in this case. For further information
about BDDs readers are recommended to see references [20,22,26,27].
The quantitative analysis also takes into account the importance of each basic event within
the global system. With this purpose, different importance measures (IMs) are considered in this
paper. IMs are used in reliability and risk analysis to quantifying the impact of single component
on a system failure [ 32]. In order to determine the importance of a component, it is necessary to
consider all the related basic events as a group [ 33]. A complete importance analysis of all groups is
therefore impractical for large systems, and it is necessary to focus on the most important groups of
components [34]. In this work Birnbaum and Criticality IMs are presented.
Birnbaum IM introduced, for an event k, a measure of importance based on the fault probability
of the system caused by the failure of the component k[35]. The priority of the event kis given by its
Birnbaum IM and is calculated as follows:
IBirn
kBQsys
Bqk
where qkis the failure probability assigned to the kevent, and Qsysis the probability of the top event.
A drawback related to the Birnbaum IM is that it does not consider the failure probability of the k
event and, therefore, a high importance can be assigned to rare events.
Criticality IM [ 18], in contrast to Birnbaum, takes into account the failure probability of a certain
component. It rectiﬁes the drawback presented in Birnbaum IM, balancing the values obtained. It is
deﬁned as:
ICrit
kqk
QsysBQsys
Bqkqk
QsysIBirn
k
where ICrit
kis the Criticality IM of the kevent, qkis the probability assigned to the kevent and Qsysis
the top event probability. Criticality IM provides a different perspective than the Birnbaum IM, even
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

though both are connected providing a measurement of the criticality of each components. Therefore,
the Criticality IM has been employed in the following sections to carry out a simulation as realistic
as possible.
4. FTA for WTs
A study of failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) for WTs in 2010 (RELIAWIND project)
collected the causes of failure and failure modes of a speciﬁc WT of 2MW with a diameter of 80
m [35]. Some causes of failures (or root causes) are summarized in [ 36]. These main causes of the
failures can be due to environmental conditions (e.g., lightning, ice, ﬁre, strong winds, etc.) or to
defects, malfunctions or failures in the components of the WT (e.g., braking system failure, or be
struck by blade, etc.) [37,38]. The causes of failures (or root causes) of the components of a wind
turbine can be summarized as follows [ 35,39]: structural (design fault, external damage, installation
defect, maintenance fault, manufacturing defect, mechanical overload, mechanical overload–collision,
mechanical overload–wind, presence of debris); wear (corrosion, excessive brush wear, fatigue,
pipe puncture, vibration fatigue, overheating, insufﬁcient lubrication); electrical (calibration error,
connection failure, electrical overload, electrical short, insulation failure, lightning strike, loss of
power input, conducting debris, software design fault). Some of the principal component failure
modes of WTs are [ 35,39]: mechanical (rupture, uprooting, fracture, detachment, thermal, blockage,
misalignment, scufﬁng); electrical (electrical insulation, electrical failure, output inaccuracy, software
fault, intermittent output); material (fatigue, structural, ultimate, buckling, deﬂection).
In this work, the construction of the illustrative FT has been focused on a three blades, pitch
system and geared WT. The turbine has been divided into four major groups of elements for a better
FTA: The foundation and tower; the blades system; the electrical components (including generator,
electrical and electronic components), and; the power train (including speed shafts, bearings and a
gearbox). The elements of the FT are connected by AND and OR gates, and their fault probability is
unknown. The failures considered in this paper are set by an exhaustive review of the literature and
the support of experts from the NIMO and OPTIMUS FP7 European projects [40,41].
Table 1 shows a summary of the failures from the literature taken into account for this paper. It
can be seen that gearboxes, generators, blades and electric and control systems have been extensively
studied in the literature, but there are not many references about other components such as brakes,
hydraulic and yaw systems.

The following sub-sections show the events or components considered to build the FT presented
in Appendix 1. This FT is built from the different sub-trees that correspond to the four main parts of a
WT aforementioned (see also the ﬁrst column of Table 1). The components and faults that are involved
in system failures are obtained from the NIMO and OPTIMUS European Projects. The interrelation
between these faults is also done considering the literature. The FT in Appendix 1 is composed by the
following four main sub-trees:
- g001 corresponds to a “Foundation and Tower Failure” described in Section 4.1.
- g002 corresponds to a “Critical Rotor Failure” depicted in Section 4.2.
- g003 corresponds to a “Power Train Failure” showed in Section 4.4.
- g004 corresponds to a “Electrical Components Failure” presented in Section 4.3.
4.1. Foundation and Tower
The tower supports the nacelle that is located at a suitable height in order to minimize the inﬂuence
of turbulence and to maximize the wind energy. The tower is assembled by thin-wall cylindrical
elements welded together along their perimeters in three sections that are joined by bolts. This is done
in order to enable the transportation of the large structural elements to the wind farm where they need
to be assembled [ 66]. The base section of the tower is installed on a reinforced concrete foundation
comprising a square base [67].
Structural defects associated with the tower, foundation, blades and hub, in the form of fatigue
cracks, delamination etc., can initiate and evolve with time [ 44]. The main causes for structural failures
are fatigue induced crack initiation and propagation, extreme wind speeds and distribution, extreme
turbulences, maximum ﬂow inclination and terrain complexity [ 39], and also the ﬁre, ice accumulation
or lightning bolt strikes. Material fatigue [ 38] (tower-based fatigue damage has been shown to decrease
signiﬁcantly when using active pitch for the blades [ 40,43]), impact of blades on the tower, faulty
welding and failure of the brakes [45] are the main representative failure modes.
The literature shows that the major faults found on WT towers are: cracks in the concrete base,
corrosion, gaps in the foundation section, loosen studs joining the foundation and the ﬁrst section,
loosen bolts joining ﬁrst/second and second/third sections and welding damages [38].
On the top of the tower, the yaw system turns the nacelle in an optimum angle with respect to the
wind direction. Powered by electrical or hydraulic mechanisms (this paper the electrical is considered),
the yaw systems can fail due to the failure of the yaw motor or the meteorological unit [ 46] resulting
in a wrong yaw angle. Structural failures could appear when the yaw motor is damaged or it does
not have power supply, in addition to extreme wind speed or turbulences and some structural faults.
These structural failures can cause the collapse of the tower [38].
4.2. Blade System
The rotor is located inside the nacelle. The blades are attached to the rotor shaft by the hub
and they are mounted on bearings in the rotor hub. The blades are the components of the WT with
the highest percentage of failures and downtimes [ 68,69]. Ciang et al. reviewed damage detection
methods [ 70] in 2008, considering in particular the blades [ 42]. The rotor hub supports heavy loads
that can lead to faults such as clearance loosening at the blade root, imbalance, cracks and surface
roughness [ 46]. Bearings between blades and hub can be damaged by wear produced by pitting,
deformation of outer face and rolling elements of the bearings [ 46], spalling and overheating [ 56].
Cracks can appear due to the fatigue [ 56]. Faults in lubrication and corrosion of pins are typically the
main failure cause of bearings.
The blades faults are predominantly related to structural failures, e.g., strength [ 47] and fatigue
of the ﬁbrous composite materials. Other faults, e.g., cracks, erosions, delamination and debonding,
could appear in the leading and trailing edges of the blades [ 48,69]. Delamination and debonding or
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2016 ,9, 46 7 of 20
cracks are found in the shell [ 49,50], and also in the root section of the blades [ 51]. The tip deﬂections
(a structural failure of the blade [46]) increase drag near the end of the blades [53].
A common fault of the blades is associated with the failure of the pitch control system [ 54]. In
pitch-controlled turbines, the pitch system is a mechanism that turns the blade, or part of the blade,
in order to adjust the angle of attack of the wind. Turbulence of wind is an important cause for
pitch system faults [ 71]. Pitching motion can be done by hydraulic actuators or electric motors. The
hydraulic system leads stiffness of bearings, a little backlash and a higher reliability than the electric
motors [ 52]. The hydraulic system can suffer from possible defects such as leakages, overpressure and
corrosion [56].
The weather station or meteorological unit provides information about some characteristics of
the wind (direction and speed) to the control system of the WT. The main failures found in the WT
weather station are related to the vane and the anemometer faults [ 57]. These can be the cause of a
wrong blade angle [50,55].
4.3. Generator, Electrical and Electronic Components
The generator, electrical and electronic components are installed inside the nacelle. The high
speed shaft drives the rotational torque to the generator, where the mechanical energy is converted to
electrical energy. This conversion needs a speciﬁc input speed, or a power electronic equipment to
adapt the output energy from the generator to the characteristics of the grid.
Faults in generators can be the result of electrical or mechanical causes [ 65]. The main electrical
faults are due to open-circuits or short-circuit of the winding in the rotor or stator [ 58] that could cause
overheating [ 46]. Many research works have demonstrated that bearings, rotors and stators involve
a high failure rate in WTs [ 63]. The bearing failures of the generator are usually caused by cracks,
asymmetry and imbalance [ 72]. The rotor and stator failures can be produced by broken bars [ 64],
air-gap eccentricities and dynamic eccentricities, among other failures [ 58]. Rotor imbalance and
aerodynamic asymmetry can have their origin in the non-uniform accumulation of ice and dirt over
the blades system [ 58]. Short-circuit faults, open-circuit faults and gate drive circuit faults are the
three major electrical faults of the power electronics and electric controls in WTs [ 58]. Corrosion, dirt
and terminal damage are the main mechanical defects [ 56]. The group formed by generator, electrical
system and control system, has a relevant rate of failures and downtime in WTs.
4.4. Power Train
The power train, or drive train, is installed in the nacelle and is compound by the low speed
train, the gearbox and the high speed train. Through the main bearing, the rotor is attached to the
low speed shaft that drives the rotational energy to the gearbox. The rotational speed of the rotor is
generally between 5 and 30 rpm, and the generator speed is from 750 to 1500 rpm, depending on the
type and size of generator. A gearbox is mounted between the rotor and the generator in order to
increase the rotational speeds. The gearbox output is driven to the generator through the high speed
train. A mechanical brake powered by a hydraulic system is usually mounted in the high speed train
as a secondary safe breaking system.
The low speed train failure includes main bearing [ 56] and low speed shaft defects. Severe
vibrations can appear due to impending cracks in any component, or to the mass imbalance in the
low speed shaft [ 58]. The gearbox failure is one of the most typical failures [ 53]. There are many
studies about gearboxes in the literature because their failure causes signiﬁcant downtimes in the
system [ 73]. The most common faults were found in gear teeth and bearings due to lubrication
faults [ 58], e.g., contamination due to defective sealing [ 54] or loss of oil [ 60], wear or fatigue damage
which can generate pitting, cracking, gear eccentricity, gear tooth deterioration, offset or other potential
faults [46,53].
Overheating can appear in shafts due to the rotational movement of the high speed train. The
wear and fatigue, that can initiate cracks [ 46] and mass imbalance [ 58], are the principal source of
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

failures in the high speed shaft. The main failure causes of brakes are overpressure or oil leakages [ 6],
cracking of the brake disc and calipers [56].
5. Maintenance Management Approach
The maintenance management proposed in this paper aims to maximise the RAMS of the offshore
wind farms optimising the resources such as human or material, conditioned to exogenous variables,
e.g., weather conditions [ 74]. This approach is based on the probability of failure of each WT. The
operation of the WT will be focused on a set of components collected by a FT (see Appendix 1). The
fault probability of any component is simulated by a statistical function of failure probability over the
time (see Appendix 2). Then, the failure probability of a WT is set by the Boolean expression obtained
from the BDD. Therefore, according to the resources, the maintenance task will be done in the WTs that
present more fault probability over a threshold set. It will lead to predict any preventive/predictive
maintenance task over the time. The importance measurements will determine the components that
need a maintenance task. A low probability threshold is set to determine if the fault probability of the
WT is under control or not. The importance measurement is calculated with the Criticality IM method.
The downtime can be deﬁned as the period of time that is required to carry out the corresponding
maintenance task. Each event of the fault tree has associated one maintenance task with a speciﬁc
downtime. The downtime depends on endogenous and exogenous variables. Figure 3 shows the
ﬂowchart of the procedure maintenance management.

8 The fault probability  of any component  is simulated  by a statistical  function of failure probability  
over the time (see Appendix  2). Then, the failure probability  of a WT is set by the Boolean expression  
obtained  from the BDD. Therefore,  according  to the resources,  the maintenance  task will be done in 
the WTs that present more fault probability  over a threshold  set. It will lead to predict any 
preventive/predictive  maintenance  task over the time. The importance  measurements  will determine  
the components  that need a maintenance  task. A low probability  threshold  is set to determine  if the 
fault probability  of the WT is under control or not. The importance  measurement  is calculated  with 
the Criticality  IM method. The downtime  can be defined as the period of time that is required  to carry 
out the corresponding  maintenance  task. Each event of the fault tree has associated  one maintenance  
task with a specific downtime.  The downtime  depends  on endogenous  and exogenous  variables.

farm has been designed  taking into account considerations  from expert of the NIMO and OPTIMUS  
research projects. It has been designed  in order to demonstrate  and validate the approach  proposed

mathematical  models have been defined for each event (see Appendix  2). These models have been 
based on time‐dependent  probability  functions  to describe the behavior  of events over the time. These 
probability  models are not intended  to match exactly the real behavior  of the events because there is 
no dataset to validate it, therefore  it they have been set by the aforementioned  expert. For example,  
the event e006 corresponds  to the corrosion  of the foundation  or tower, where a linear increasing  
probability  have been assigned  to this event, this is due to the salinity that is assumed  to be constant

6. Case Study
An offshore wind farm composed by 20 WTs has been taken into account. The offshore wind farm
has been designed taking into account considerations from expert of the NIMO and OPTIMUS research
projects. It has been designed in order to demonstrate and validate the approach proposed in this paper.
The WTs are the same type, with the same FT, given in Appendix 1. Different mathematical models
have been deﬁned for each event (see Appendix 2). These models have been based on time-dependent
probability functions to describe the behavior of events over the time. These probability models are
not intended to match exactly the real behavior of the events because there is no dataset to validate it,
therefore it they have been set by the aforementioned expert. For example, the event e006 corresponds
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

to the corrosion of the foundation or tower, where a linear increasing probability have been assigned
to this event, this is due to the salinity that is assumed to be constant over the time. The main novelty
lies in the procedure to elaborate qualitatively and quantitatively a preventive maintenance planning
process based on the knowledge of the WTs and on statistical data that, for example, could be collected
through condition monitoring systems [75,76]. The probability functions employed are:
I Constant probability
In this model the probability of the event is constant over the time:
qptqK,pKPR{0¤K¤1q
II Exponential increasing probability
In this model, the probability function assigned is:
qptq1et,pPR{¥0q
where determines the rising velocity of the probability.
III Linear increasing probability
In this model, the probability function is:
qptq#
mt mt 1
1mt¥1;@m¡1
where mdetermines the rising velocity of the probability.
IV Periodic probability
This model represents those components that need to be replaced, repaired, and zeroed in a
periodical way. In this model, the events have a periodic behavior following the next expression:
qptq1eptnaq,n1, 2, 3
where is a positive parameter and determines the rising velocity of the probability, and is a
parameter that deﬁnes the size of the time period.
Figure 4 shows the probability of the events of one WT over the time taken into account the
probability function assigned to each event. The simulation has been carried out for 600 samples,
where each sample can be considered as a period of one day. The objective is to propose an algorithm
able to collect stochastic information of the failure probability of a complex system.

In the top boxplot of Figure 12, the weather conditions have not been taken into account. In the
second one, the weather forecasting presented in Figure 11 has been considered. In the last one boxplot,
an adverse weather conditions have been established. The presence of adverse weather conditions
makes to increase the average fault probability of the offshore wind farm, and the size of the boxes of

8. Conclusions
The offshore wind energy is being supported by the international community. Offshore wind
farms employ large and complex wind turbines that generate more power electricity than onshore.
The farms are located in places with difﬁculty to access that depends of the weather conditions. These
conditions have leaded the development of robust remote condition monitoring system in order to
increase the RAMS of the offshore wind farms.
This paper presents the BDD in order to evaluate qualitatively the FTA of a WT. The approach is
based on the fault probabilities of each component of the WT, that depend of a statistical function of
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

probability of occurrence over the time. The fault probability of the WT has been set by the Boolean
expression obtained by the BDD. An optimal ranking of the events has been done for minimising the
computational cost.
The IMs have been employed in order to facilitate the improvement of the maintenance
management and the resources deployment in an offshore wind farm, where a proper and accurate
prioritization of the basic events has been elaborated according to Criticality IM method.
The maintenance management approach proposed in this paper maximise the RAMS of the
offshore wind farm, optimising the resources as human, materials, etc.The maintenance task will be
carried out in the WTs that present more fault probability over a threshold. It will lead to establishment
of preventive/predictive maintenance tasks over time. A low probability threshold has also been set to
determine when the fault probability of the WT is under control. The time to carry out a maintenance
task has been established by the downtime associated to each failure. The downtime depends on the
time to repair or replace the component, human resourcesstate of the sea, etc.
It has been demonstrated that the average fault probability of the offshore wind farm decreases
more when two instead of one WT can be attended at the same time than between four instead of three.
The main conclusion is that there is a reasonable amount of resources that allow controlling the average
fault probability of the offshore wind farm, and this method can be used to calculate this value.
The weather conditions have been also considered. The average fault probability of the offshore
wind farm increases when there is a presence of adverse weather conditions. The adverse weather
increases the gap between the failure probabilities of the different WTs that compose the wind farm
because the maintenance tasks that can be done are minimum.
The dynamic analysis proposed in this paper can be used to improve the maintenance planning
using the fault probability of the system over the time. The fault probability and the IMs determine
when the maintenance tasks must be carried out and to set the tasks over the events.
The qualitative data used in this paper is gathered from several research projects and the results
have been validated by experts involve in the research projects. The main novelty of the paper is the
procedure to analyse endogenous and exogenous data using graphical tools.
