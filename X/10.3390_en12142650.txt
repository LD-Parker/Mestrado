Abstract: Owing to the late development of o shore wind power in China, operational data and
maintenance experience are relatively scarce. Due to the harsh environmental conditions, a reliability
analysis based on limited sample fault data has been regarded as an e ective way to investigate
maintenance optimization for o shore wind farms. The chief aim of the present work is to develop
an eective strategy to reduce the maintenance costs of o shore wind turbines in consideration
of their accessibility. The three-parameter Weibull distribution method was applied to failure rate
estimation based on limited data. Moreover, considering the impacts of weather conditions on the
marine maintenance activities, the Markov method and dynamic time window were used to depict
the weather conditions. The opportunistic maintenance strategy was introduced to cut down on
the maintenance costs through optimization of the preventive maintenance age and opportunistic
maintenance age. The simulation analysis we have performed showed that the maintenance costs of
the opportunistic maintenance strategy were 10% lower than those of the preventive maintenance
strategy, verifying the e ectiveness of the proposed maintenance strategy.

1. Introduction
In recent years, the wind power industry has made rapid progress globally. Due to abundant
oshore wind energy resources, the installed capacity and power generation of o shore wind power
are growing rapidly [ 1]. However, considering the large investment and high risk involved in o shore
wind power, and the inÔ¨Çuence of weather conditions, the requirements for o shore wind farms in
terms of operation and maintenance vessels, spare-parts management, and other inÔ¨Çuential factors are
more strict. The special operating environment of o shore wind turbines, in which the equipment
is aected by natural conditions, such as typhoons, tides, waves, can accelerate the failure of unit
components, and the increased failure rate of electrical and mechanical systems Ô¨Ånally leads to lower
reliability. Thus, the reliability of wind turbines has become an important issue.
The Weibull distribution is an important statistical measure in reliability engineering, known to
have good adaptability and availability for various forms of failure rate simulation in relation to
mechanical and electrical products. In this paper, the construction of a Weibull equation is pursued.
Based on the two-parameter Weibull equation, a location parameter was introduced to create what is
known as a three-parameter Weibull equation. Many researchers are interested in three-parameter
Weibull equations. In [ 2], a three-parameter Weibull distribution was used in the asphalt-concrete
fatigue assessment of aging. In [ 3], optimization of distribution was studied for an inventory system

established by Weibull. In [ 4], a three-parameter Weibull distribution was proposed in a study on the
mechanical sector. In [ 5], the three-parameter Weibull distribution equation was applied to predict
wind power density. In [ 6], a mixed Weibull distribution parameter estimation method was discussed.
In [7], the Weibull distribution was studied by using the three best linear unbiased parameter estimation
based on previous unbiased estimation and quasi-optimal linearity. This literature review reveals that
the three-parameter Weibull equation has been used in many Ô¨Åelds, including machinery, architecture,
and aerospace; however, so far few applications of the three-parameter Weibull distribution have been
used in fault prediction for o shore wind turbines, especially for those with limited fault data.
Moreover, access to o shore wind farms is greatly restricted by wind and wave conditions,
which hinders the operation and maintenance of the unit, thus resulting in an increase in outage time,
a decrease in the availability of units, and an increase in operation and maintenance costs. It is necessary
to consider the impacts of sea weather conditions related to unit operation and maintenance. The mpact
of weather conditions on wind turbine maintenance strategies has been investigated in previous
works. In China, in [ 8], a wind turbine reliability evaluation method was proposed. Considering the
special operating environment of o shore wind turbines, in [ 9], the impacts of weather, accessibility,
and maintenance time on the maintenance strategy of o shore wind turbines were analyzed. In [ 10],
an oshore wind turbine maintenance strategy with minimum cost and maximum reliability was
established, considering the inÔ¨Çuence of wind speed and maintenance waiting time. In [ 11,12], a normal
behavior model was proposed to further investigate wind turbine vibration and fatigue load by using
neural networks and a stochastic approach considering the inÔ¨Çuence of wind speed. In [ 13], a survey
of stochastic models for sea state and di erent o shore wind farms was made according to the di erent
maintenance schemes of o shore wind turbines, combined with the failure rate and maintenance time
for various components of the unit. In [ 14], a novel method for simulating wind and wave conditions
for oshore sites was revealed, and the result indicated that the persistence of weather windows for
signiÔ¨Åcant wave height values can be captured by this approach. All these tests show promising results,
and the weather model has been deemed accurate enough for simulations of o shore wind parks.
Moreover, in [ 15], a Markov model based on a statistical analysis of wind speed and wave height was
established, and Ô¨Ånally, the predictions were made for maintenance waiting time. Although there have
been some related studies on the e ect of weather conditions on o shore wind turbine maintenance
strategies, wind speed and wave height have not yet been simultaneously considered to evaluate the
accessibility of o shore wind turbine maintenance.
Meanwhile, many researchers have theoretically investigated the opportunistic maintenance
strategy from a di erent perspective. In [ 16], a two-level maintenance threshold strategy for wind farms
was developed, considering opportunistic maintenance and imperfect maintenance based on reliability.
In [17], opportunistic condition-based maintenance for systems subjected to degradation and shocks was
proposed to determine an optimal maintenance policy for multi-bladed o shore wind turbines. In [ 18],
a new bi-objective opportunistic maintenance optimization model was proposed, and a three-phase
discrete event simulation was used to evaluate the performance measures considering the stochastic
behavior of wind and limited maintenance capacity. In [ 19], an opportunistic maintenance approach for
wind farms was developed to take advantage of the maintenance opportunities, considering imperfect
maintenance actions. In [ 20], the trade-o between wind farm conÔ¨Åguration and the maintenance
strategy was investigated by a new bi-objective redundancy and maintenance optimization model.
The primary goal of this research is to carry out studies in an e ort to reduce the operating costs of
oshore wind turbines. In this paper, the impacts of weather conditions on the maintenance activities
are considered, the Markov chain method and dynamic time window are introduced to represent
the weather conditions, and a maintenance waiting time is proposed for o shore wind turbines.
In addition, the opportunistic maintenance strategy was used to optimize the key components of
the maintenance of the o shore wind turbines. Furthermore, the minimum maintenance cost within
the maintenance duration was deemed the optimal objective, and the preventive maintenance time
and opportunistic maintenance time have been optimized for the main components of wind turbines.

In particular, the novelties can be reÔ¨Çected in the following aspects: (1)The three-parameter Weibull
method, instead of the two-parameter Weibull method, was applied to the reliability analysis of o shore
wind turbines with limited fault data; (2) the Markov chain method was adopted to evaluate the
prediction of maintenance waiting time, considering the wind speed and wave height simultaneously;
(3) the preventive opportunistic maintenance strategy has proven to be one of the methods available to
generate maintenance cost e ciency, instead of the preventive maintenance strategy.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the two-parameter
Weibull model of onshore wind turbines by the least squares and maximum likelihood methods,
and the three-parameter Weibull model of o shore wind turbines by the correlation coe cient,
probability-weighted moment, and bilinear regression methods. In Section 3, we describe the
construction of a Weibull equation for o shore wind turbines based on scant sample fault data. Section 4
describes the Markov prediction method. In Section 5, we develop an opportunistic maintenance
strategy based on accessibility evaluation. Section 6 gives the opportunistic maintenance simulation
based on maintenance waiting time. In Section 7, we propose conclusions and recommendations from
our study and suggest areas for further research.
2. Reliability Analysis Model for Wind T urbines
For wind turbines, the commonly used reliability analysis model is the Weibull distribution.
This distribution is derived from the analysis of material strength by Weibull. It is a very important
distribution form in reliability engineering [ 21]. The probability density function of the Weibull model
obtained from the weakest link theory is

In Equations (1) and (2), is the scale parameter, is the shape parameter, >0, andis the
position parameter, >0.is the threshold value for failure, is used to describe the dispersion of the
measured values, and is related to the average measured values.
In the failure analysis of the product, is associated with the failure mechanism of the product,
and the di erent values of are accompanied by di erent fault mechanisms. When <1, the failure-rate
function is a decreasing function, showing the life distribution of products under the wear-out failure
period. When =1, the failure-rate function is constant, representing the products in the life
distribution of the random failure period. When  > 1, the failure-rate function is an increasing
function, showing the distribution of products in the period of life [22].

2.1. Weibull Model of Onshore Wind Turbines
For onshore wind turbines, because of their simple operating conditions and abundant operation
and fault data, in practical applications, the common assumption is that the device fails at time =0,
and the corresponding expressions, Equations (1) and (2), respectively, can be simpliÔ¨Åed as follows:


(t0), (4)
F(t) =1 exp
 t

(t0). (5)
At present, the two-parameter Weibull analysis method is roughly divided into several categories,
i.e., least-squares estimation, median rank regression, maximum-likelihood estimation, and method
of moments. For engineering purposes, maximum likelihood is usually considered Ô¨Årst due to its
high accuracy, as compared to method of moment, which tends to be adopted only if the maximum
likelihood function will be di cult to construct. In this paper, we used maximum likelihood rather
than method of moment.
Practically, median-rank regression can perform well in the case of extreme values occurring
when the number of failures is small. Generally, based on the least squares method, the mean variable
will be replaced by the median-rank variable so as to alleviate the estimated deviation caused by the
extreme value. In this study, the maintenance optimization was based on a small sample, and the
extreme value was carved out; therefore, the least squares method, rather than median-rank regression,
was pursued, as follows.
2.1.1. Least-Squares Estimation

2.1.2. Maximum-Likelihood Estimation
Maximum-likelihood estimation is an e ective method of parameter estimation. It has strong
applicability, especially in the case of incomplete life. The basic idea is to select the undetermined
parameters Ô¨Årst so that the probability of samples appearing in the Ô¨Åeld of observation is greatest;
then the sample value is taken as the unknown parameter‚Äôs point estimated value [23].

2.2. Weibull Model of O shore Wind Turbines
The three-parameter Weibull distribution is used in the life tests of materials with a low stress
level, which have better characteristics of curve Ô¨Åtting as compared to the two-parameter Weibull
distribution. In the Weibull distribution function, the positional parameter is the threshold value
for the failure time of targeted devices and is used to estimate the earliest failure time. Changes in
positional parameters will a ect the curve displacement of the probability density curve. Generally,
when the unit operation time exceeds the positional parameter, the unit starts to fail.
In contrast with onshore wind farms, the conditions of operation and maintenance of o shore
wind farms are extremely complicated due to tidewater, typhoons, and corrosion, which result in
an increasing probability of the unit components‚Äô failure as well as increased maintenance costs.
In addition, due to the particularity of the environment, when a unit failure occurs at an o shore
wind farm, maintenance personnel may not be able to reach the site for several months due to harsh
weather conditions, which results in di culty in obtaining component failure data and failure models.
Therefore, it is crucial to carry out reliability prediction as soon as possible.
As part of our research, we performed a comparative analysis of the two-parameter Weibull
distribution and the three-parameter Weibull distribution. The Weibull three-parameter equation
prevails in short-term failure prediction and can be used e ectively before t=. With regard to
short-term failure rate prediction, an abrupt and abnormal rise in the failure rate has taken place
under the two-parameter Weibull distribution. On the contrary, the failure rate curve under the
three-parameter Weibull distribution displays a rational and smooth rising trend.
However, three parameters exist at the same time, so estimating the parameters of the
three-parameter Weibull distribution is di cult. The least-squares method and the maximum-likelihood
method are no longer applicable to the three-parameter Weibull distribution. MATLAB is a mathematics
software produced by MathWorks. It is a high-level technical computing language and interactive
environment for algorithm development, data visualization, data analysis, and numerical calculation,

The relationship between Xand Yis a linear relationship, as shown in Equation (14). Equation (14)
shows that when the estimate of is correct, a linear relationship exists between Xand Y, i.e.,
the correlation coe cient between Xand Yis a maximum. The correlation coe cient rbetween Xand
Yis obtained by
r=Cov(X,Y)p
Var[X]Var[Y](15)
According to the Ô¨Çowchart shown in Figure 1, column vectors containing ( k 1),
correlation coe cients are obtained. The step size pcan be adjusted according to the actual situation
and is selected as 0.01 in the paper. The correlation coe cient rinitially increases and then decreases.
The position of the corresponding maximum correlation coe cient is found as N, and the optimal
estimation value of the position parameter is recorded as

4.1.2. Markov Chain
The Markov chain is a discrete-time stochastic process with Markov property, and the model is
usually expressed as = (S,P,Q), where the meaning of each element is as follows [27]:
1) Srepresents a non-empty set of all possible states in a random process. State is the result of
a random process occurring at a certain moment. Pis a one-step state transition probability
matrix. Conditional probability can be expressed as follows:
PX(t+1)=jX(t)=i	=Pij (27)
2) Qis the initial state probability distribution vector, Let Q=[q1,q2,:::,qn]denote the probability
that the stochastic process is in state xiat time t=0 isqi, then
nX
i=1qi=1 (28)
4.2. Data Processing Based on Markov Method
When using the Markov chain model for predictive analysis, the random variables need to be
processed as follows:
(1) State division of random variables;
(2) Calculation of state transition probability;
(3) Test of ‚ÄúMarkov property‚Äù.
4.2.1. State Division of Random Variables
For the state division of random variables, the following methods are possibilities [28]:
(1) Sample mean value-mean variance partition method;
(2) Ordered clustering method;
(3) Fuzzy clustering method.
In this paper, only the Ô¨Årst method is used and will be brieÔ¨Çy described below.
Suppose a random observation set of random variable Xisx1,x2,:::,xn, the sample mean is x,
and the sample mean variance is s. If the absolute value jrjof the auto-correlation coe cients of this set
is0.30, it can be approximated as an independent and identically distributed sequence. According to
the central limit theorem:
(
Px sxx+s	=2F(1.0) 10.68
Px 1.5sxx+1.5s	=2F(1.5) 10.87(29)
4.2.2. Calculation of State Transition Probability
Before using the Markov chain for prediction, it is necessary to estimate the transition probability
of the Markov chain from the historical observation sequence.
Suppose a set of observation sequences in a random variable Xisx1,x2,:::,xm, which contains
nstates, namely the state space S=f1, 2,:::,ng. Use fijto indicate the frequency of the observation
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

sequence from state ito state jthrough one step, i,j2S. A matrix (fij)i,j2Scomposed of fij(i,j2S)is
called a transfer frequency matrix. The value obtained by dividing the element of the i-th row and the
j-th column in the transfer frequency matrix by the sum of the elements of the i-th row is called the
maximum likelihood estimation of the transition probability, ÀÜPij,i,j2S, as follows:
ÀÜPij=fij
nP
j=1fij(30)
4.2.3. Test of ‚ÄúMarkov Property‚Äù
It is necessary to test whether the random variable sequence has ‚ÄúMarkov property‚Äù before
applying the Markov chain model to solve practical problems. Usually, a discrete sequence of the
Markov chain can be tested using the 2statistic.
The marginal probability is denoted as Pj, as follows:
Pj=nP
i=1fij
nP
i=1nP
j=1fij(31)
Then, when nis suciently large, the statistics obeys the 2distribution with a degree of freedom
of(n 1)2, where Pijis the transition probability.

sequences x1,x2,:::,xmhave ‚ÄúMarkov property‚Äù [29].
4.3. Markov Prediction Model
The operation and maintenance of o shore wind turbines are a ected by weather conditions,
such as sea wind speed and wind direction, and sea conditions, such as wave height and cycle.
Among them, wind speed and wave height are the two most important factors a ecting the accessibility
of wind turbines [ 30]. As a consequence, in this paper, the accessibility of o shore wind turbines is
studied mainly by considering the wind speed and wave height.
Oshore wind speed and wave height are characterized by time variation and randomness.
Commonly used research methods include Gaussian statistics, the Markov method, and the
auto-regressive moving average method. The Markov method was used to build the model
since the method can accurately describe the long-term and seasonal wind speed and wave
height distribution [31].
There are three main methods for Markov chain prediction [32]:
(1) Markov chain prediction based on absolute distribution;
(2) Superimposed Markov chain prediction;
(3) Weighted Markov chain prediction.
In the case of unrestricted visual conditions, the operation and maintenance of offshore wind farms
only need to consider the effects of wind speed and wave height. On the other hand, according to the
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2019 ,12, 2650 15 of 26
monitoring of coastal sea conditions by the National Ocean Forecasting Station, the relationship between
the average wind speed at sea and the effective wave height can be expressed as in Equation (33) [33]:
Hs=0.038 V2.0+0.1950 (33)
where Hsis the e ective wave height, and Vrepresents the wind speed. Based on this, the paper
simpliÔ¨Åes the weather conditions at sea, and the wind speed prediction value can be obtained according
to Equation (33).
Due to the fact that the wind speed and wave height at sea have obvious periodicity and seasonality
and the state transition probability satisÔ¨Åes the ‚Äútime homogeneity‚Äù characteristic, this paper uses the
Markov chain prediction method based on absolute distribution to model the weather of o shore wind
farms. The detailed method and steps for modeling are as follows:
(1) State division of historical observation data of wind speed and wave height. In this paper, DHs=
0.1 m, DV=1 m/s orDHs=0.4 m, DV=1 m/s were used as the standard interval grouping
method to classify the state of the sea wind and waves.
(2) According to the state group established by step (1), a frequency transfer matrix (fij)i,j2S
and a Markov chain state transition probability matrix (ÀÜPij)i,j2Shaving a step size of one can
be obtained.
(3) Test of ‚ÄúMarkov property‚Äù.
(4) If the state at time tis known at which the wind speed and the wave height is i, the initial
distribution can be considered to be as follows:
P(0)=(0,, 0, 1, 0,, 0) (34)
The absolute distribution of wind speed and wave height at t+1 is
P(1)=P(0)P=(pi1,pi2,,pin) (35)
The predicted state jat time t+1 satisÔ¨Åes Equation (36):
pij=maxn
pij,j2So
S=f1, 2,,ng (36)
Then, the wind speed and wave height at time t+kcan be obtained.
(5) Duration prediction of accessibility and inaccessible state. According to the current ship
performance and sea level in China, referring to the domestic and foreign related literature [ 34],
and combined with the weather and ocean conditions in the sea area where the o shore wind
farm is located, the operation and maintenance of o shore wind farms are generally operated at
wind speed V10 m/s and wave height Hs2 m. According to Equation (32), when the wave
height is less than 2 m, the wind speed can meet the ship‚Äôs sea conditions. Therefore, the paper
only needs to consider the wave height. Suppose His a set of accessibility states that contains
multiple wind speeds and wave height states; according to Equation (36), the one-step state
transition probability matrix ePforHand its complement S H(denoted as eH) can be obtained.
The steady-state distribution vector is e=n
eH,eeHo
, where eH,eeHrepresent the probability of
state set HandeH, respectively.

Then, the average duration E() can be obtained according to Equation (39):
E()=1X

(6) Maintenance waiting time prediction analysis. The operation and maintenance of o shore wind
turbines are a ected by climate and tides, resulting in increased waiting time for maintenance and
limited actual maintenance time. Assuming that personnel, vessels, spare parts, etc., are adequately
prepared, the waiting time for maintenance depends only on the weather conditions.
Assuming that the unit components fail at time tand the total time required for failure repair and
transportation is tn, the maintenance waiting time can be estimated using the dynamic time window.
The speciÔ¨Åc steps are as follows:
1) Determine the season wat time t, and then calculate the cumulative probability distribution based
on the probability ( w) of each state in the season. A random number between (0, 1) is generated,
and the cumulative probability distribution interval in which the random number is located is
determined; thereby, a state Xt,wof the wind speed and the wave height at the same moment can
be obtained.
2) IfXt,w2H, then initialize the duration tlo=Dtof the reachable state and the maintenance waiting
time twa=0; if not, let tlo=0,twa=Dt, where Dtis the Markov model step size.
3) According to the one-step state transition matrix Pw, the probability vector of the state Xt,w
converted to the next moment state is PX,w, and Xt,w=PX,w. The next time state Xt+1,wis obtained
according to the method in step (1).
4) IfXt+1,w2H, update the reachable state duration tlo=tlo+Dt,t=t+1; otherwise, tlo=0,
twa=tlo+Dt,t=t+1.
5) Repeat steps (3) and (4) until tlotn, where twais the waiting time for this maintenance activity.
5. An Opportunistic Maintenance Strategy Based on Accessibility Evaluation
A wind turbine is a complex multi-component system. Once a component fails, the functions of
other components will also be a ected, resulting in overall shutdown and the need for maintenance of
the unit. The paper intends to study a maintenance strategy for o shore wind turbines in combination
with equipment fault repair and preventive maintenance.

5.2. Opportunistic Maintenance Model 
5.2.1. Opportunistic Maintenance Probability Density Function 
According to the opportunistic maintenance strategy  in Figure 7, the expected replacement rate 
of the component consists of three parts, comple te replacement, incomple te repair, and minimum 
maintenance. This paper only considers the opportunistic maintenance strategy for a complete replacement. According to the update process theory, when the component is repaired for a period of time, the maintenance rate is close to constant, which is the reciprocal of the expected replacement 
cycle of the component. According to the opportunis tic maintenance strategy shown in Figure 7, the 
replacement rate 
iŒª of one component consists of three parts, as shown in Equation (42): 
()1i i ci oi pi ET ŒªŒª Œª Œª== + +  (42) 
where ()ii iPfŒªŒª=√ó ; ()oi i iPo ŒªŒª=√ó ; ()pi i iPp ŒªŒª=√ó  are the failure replacement rate, 
opportunistic replacement rate, and preventive re placement rate of one component, respectively. iP 
is the replacement probability and ()iET is the expected life of the component. 
Since the opportunistic replacement of component i is caused by the failure replacement or 
preventive replacement of other components, th e opportunistic replacement probability density 
function of the component i can be approximated as an exponent ial distribution function, as follows:

According to the opportunistic maintenance strategy in Figure 7, the expected replacement rate
of the component consists of three parts, complete replacement, incomplete repair, and minimum

replacement. According to the update process theory, when the component is repaired for a period of
time, the maintenance rate is close to constant, which is the reciprocal of the expected replacement
cycle of the component. According to the opportunistic maintenance strategy shown in Figure 7,
the replacement rate iof one component consists of three parts, as shown in Equation (42):

wherei=Pi(f)i;oi=Pi(o)i;pi=Pi(p)iare the failure replacement rate, opportunistic

where fi(t)is the failure probability density function of component i, which obeys the

5.2.3. Opportunistic Maintenance Optimization Model
During one replacement cycle of a wind turbine component, the maintenance cost of component i
consists of replacement costs, downtime losses, and rental vessel costs. The expected repair cost of
component iduring a replacement cycle can be expressed as follows:
Ei(C)=[Cci+ (twa+tn)Ce]Pi(c)+CoiPi(o)
+h
Cpi+ (twa+tn)Cei
Pi(p)+CN(50)
where Cci,Cpi,Coirepresent the costs of failure maintenance, preventive maintenance, and opportunistic
maintenance, respectively, of component i;Ceis the loss per unit downtime, and CNis the rental
vessel cost.
During one replacement cycle of a wind turbine component, the expected life of component ican
be expressed as follows:
Ei(T)=RTo(i)

6.2. Simulation Analysis of the Opportunistic Maintenance Strategy
In this paper, a 3 MW wind turbine in an o shore wind farm in China is used as an example to
optimize the opportunistic maintenance strategy for the critical components of the unit, including the
gearbox, the main bearing, and the generator. According to the analysis of the statistical data of failure
record of the unit, the failure time of the component follows the Weibull distribution, and the speciÔ¨Åc
parameters are shown in Table 9 below, where 1, 2, 3, and 4 represent the blade, gearbox, main bearing,
and generator, respectively; andare the shape parameters and scale parameters of the components,
respectively; unit downtime loss Ce=720 yuan /h; and the ship chartering fee CN=150,000 yuan /day.

When the traditional age-preventive maintenance strategy is adopted, the preventive maintenance
age of the critical components of the unit is optimized to minimize the average cost rate. The results
after optimization are shown in Table 10.

From the comparison of the results in Tables 10 and 11, it can be seen that the maintenance cost of
the wind turbine using the opportunistic maintenance strategy is 10% lower than that of the preventive
maintenance strategy.
Although the proposed model gains competitiveness in terms of the unit maintenance cost,
its limitations are as follows:
(1) The research on the maintenance cost was aimed at the key components of a single wind turbine
rather than multiple wind turbines.
(2) InÔ¨Çuential factors, such as the availability of vessels, the adequacy of the spare parts, and the
meteorological conditions, were linked to maintenance waiting time. In this paper, wind speed and
wave height were considered in the determination of maintenance waiting time, assuming vessels
and spare parts were available.
7. Conclusions
Before concluding, one additional point needs to be discussed. Because the operating environment
of oshore wind turbines is complex, wind is a crucial factor that should be considered in optimal
maintenance decisions. Moreover, the randomness of wind impacts on the power generated by wind
turbines, which contributes to unsatisfactory energy costs. In this paper, the inÔ¨Çuence that Ô¨Çuctuations
in wind speed had on the costs of o shore wind farming was considered in the determination of
maintenance waiting time. From the perspective of reducing the entire-life costs of an o shore wind
farm, we paid attention to how much maintenance costs will be reduced with the introduction of the
opportunistic maintenance strategy. Actually, in this sense, how the wind Ô¨Çuctuation will act on the
unit cost is not the research priority in this study. Indeed, the inÔ¨Çuence of wind Ô¨Çuctuation and grid
impact on the unit is worth intensively study in further research.
In this paper, we attempted to analyze the characteristics of operation data of o shore wind
turbines and investigated reliability analysis methods for o shore wind turbines based on limited
fault data. Considering the inÔ¨Çuence of weather factors, such as wind speed and wave height,
we studied maintenance waiting time prediction methods for o shore wind turbines. Combining failure
maintenance and preventive maintenance, we proposed an opportunity-based o shore wind turbine
maintenance strategy. The main study results are as follows:
(1) The construction of a Weibull equation for o shore wind turbines was based on a small amount of
sample fault data. Di erent to [ 8], based on the construction of a two-parameter Weibull equation,
a three-parameter Weibull equation was proposed. The results show that the maintenance costs
can be reduced by 8% with the adoption of a three-parameter Weibull model, and the Ô¨Åtting curve
and failure rate short-term prediction of the three-parameter Weibull distribution is superior to
the two-parameter Weibull distribution where there are limited fault data;
(2) A maintenance waiting time prediction method was introduced for o shore wind turbines.
The Markov chain method and dynamic time window were used to describe wind speed and
wave height, and a maintenance waiting time prediction model was established. Di erent to [ 9],
the impacts on maintenance waiting time arising from wind speed and wave height were
considered in this paper. The results show that the deviation of the predicted value of the wave
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2019 ,12, 2650 25 of 26
height obtained by grouping interval with DHs=0.1 m was the smallest, which was close to the
true value;
(3) Combining failure maintenance and preventive maintenance, an opportunistic maintenance
strategy was presented for o shore wind turbines. The minimum expected maintenance cost
was regarded as an objective function to optimize the opportunistic maintenance time and
preventive maintenance time. Compared with [ 10], the opportunistic maintenance strategy
reduces maintenance duration and decreases the maintenance waiting time and downtime,
thereby reducing maintenance costs. The results show that the maintenance cost was reduced
by 10% under the opportunistic maintenance strategy for o shore wind turbine maintenance,
which veriÔ¨Åed the e ectiveness and superiority of the opportunistic maintenance strategy for
oshore wind turbine maintenance.
