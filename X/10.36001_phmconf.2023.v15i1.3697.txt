ABSTRACT  
The burgeoning importance of offshore wind farms (OWFs) 
in the transition to sustainable energy systems underscores 
the need for effective Prognostics and Health Management 
(PHM) strategies. While the current PHM framework 
demonstrates its prowess in enhancing the reliability and 
operational efficiency of OWFs, this paper contends that its 
potential remains largely untapped due to certain inherent 
limitations. This study casts a comprehensive spotlight on 
the limitations and untapped opportunities within the PHM 
framework for OWFs from  a Socio -Technical -Ecological 
Systems (SETS) perspective.  
The limitations, as identified, are threefold. First, the 
existing framework exhibits an over -reliance on technical 
factors, thus prioritizing maximization of Remaining Useful 
Life and cost minimiza tion. This emphasis disregards 
crucial Non -Technological Factors (such as community 
impacts, stakeholder engagement,  Human and Organization 
Factors (HOFs))  and uncertainty arising from them, which 
can exert significant influences on OWF ’s health and 
perfor mance. Second, the PHM approach often adopts a 
component -centric view, with focus on dominant 
degradation modes, thus undermining the intricate 
interdependencies among diverse components  and failure 
modes . This lack of a System Level Perspective (SLP) and 
Multi -Modal Degradation (MMD) hampers a 
comprehensive understanding of how component 
degradation cascades through the entire system. Third, the 
current framework largely  ignores the ecological 
considerati ons, despite compelling evidence that the current 
monitoring, assessment, and maintenance activities  has 
significant  ecological consequences .  
By addressing the identified limitations and leveraging the 
opportunities  together with AI , the PHM framework for 
OWFs can evolve into a more comprehensive, inclusive, and resilient approach . The proposed paradigm shift 
resonates deeply with the contemporary drive towards 
sustainability, not only in terms of technical efficacy but 
also in terms of social acceptance a nd ecological 
compatibility.  
1. INTRODUCTION  
Offshore wind energy has a huge potential as an alternative 
to fossil fuels in regard to decarbonizing, mitigating 
greenhouse gas emissions (International Energy Agency, 
(2019))  and contributing to achieving the Un ited Nations 
SDG#7 “affordable and clean energy” & SDG#13 “climate 
action” (United Nations, (2016)) . With an annual electricity 
generation capacity of 12GW from offshore wind farms 
(OWFs), the European Union (EU) leads the tally and has 
plans to ramp up th e generation to 60GW by 2030 and 
300GW by 2050 for a climate -neutral future  (European 
Commission, (2020)) .  Norway’s ambitions align with that 
of the EU, as the target is to generate 30GW by operating 
1500 offshore wind turbines (WTs) within 2040 (Norwegia n 
Government, (2022)) .  Ongoing development of Hywind 
Tampen (Equinor, (2022))  followed by tendering of Sørlige 
Nordsjø II and Utsira Nord (Norwegian Government, 
(2022)) marks the first step in this direction.   
To remain economically attractive for investo rs and 
consumers, it is vital to decrease the levelized cost of energy 
from  OWFs (Mai, Lantz, Mowers , & Wiser (2017)) . In 
order to achieve these significant technical developments 
have been made in blade, drivetrain and foundation design 
of WTs (IRENA , (2019)), however still challenges related to 
system dynamics,  optimization and control of wind farms 
are being actively researched (Clifton, A., Barber, S., Bray, 
A., Enevoldsen, P., Fields, J., Sempreviva, A. M., Williams, 
L., Quick, J., Purdue, M., Totaro,  P., & Ding, Y. (2023 )). 
Another approach of reducing LCoE, is to increase 
availability of wind turbines 24/7, by optimal O&M 
activities, as it can account up to 35% of running cost of the 
OWFs (Sarker, B. R., & Faiz, T. I. (2016 ). This is achieved 
due to the timely inspection a nd maintenance (I&M) based  Arvind Keprate . This is an open -access article distributed under the

upon the  performance monitoring of the WTs . 
Performance monitoring leverages the Supervisory Control 
and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system to establish 
correlations between various parameters, such as wind 
speed and power output. This approach develops models to 
define normal operational states, utili zing them to pinpoint 
abnormal  behaviors and activate alarms sent to operators, 
signaling the need for Inspection and Maintenance (I&M) 
activities (Jansen, M., Staffell, I., Kitzing, L., Quoilin, S., 
Wiggelinkhuizen, E., Bulder, B., Riepin, I., & Müsgens, F. 
(2020 )). Nonetheless, this methodology grapples with two 
pivotal challenges. Firstly,  the trigger ed alarm does not 
provide any insight into the causality of the abnormal 
behavior, in layman’s terms it does not provide answers to 
the questions like “How severe is the fault?” or, “When will 
the degrading component fail?”, or “Which component is 
failing?”. Secondly, SCADA -generated alarms rely on the 
past degradation state of components. This temporal 
constraint often leads to insufficient time for equipmen t upkeep or replacement due to logistical complexities linked 
to operational weather constraints and the remote nature of 
OWFs  (Sheng, S. (2017) ). 
To surmount these challenges, OWF operators recognize the 
potential of integrating the Prognostics and Health  
Management (PHM) approach to formulate optimal I&M 
strategies for OWFs. As illustrated in Figure 1, PHM 
leverages sensor data from in -situ SCADA systems or 
retrofitted Condition Monitoring (CM) systems.  These data 
sources, combined with diverse analytics and machine 
learning (ML) techniques, facilitate fault detection, 
diagnosis, prognosis, and health management across OWFs. 
Recent years have witnessed notable progress in deploying 
various methodologies, including stochastic modeling (Cao, 
L., Qian, Z., Za reipour, H., Wood, D., Mollasalehi, E., Tian, 
S., & Pei, Y. (2018 )), machine learning (Elforjani, M., & 
Shanbr, S. (2018 )), physics -based techniques (Breteler, D., 
Kaidis, C., Tinga, T., & Loendersloot, R. (2015) ), and 
hybrid approaches (Wang, P., Long, Z. , & Wang, G. (2020) ), to

3 diagnose and prognos e critical wind turbine (WT) 
components.  
A comprehensive evaluation of these techniques, 
encompassing an assessment of their strengths, limitations, 
and potential for hybrid models, has been meticulously 
presen ted by (Zhang, W., Vatn, J., & Rasheed, A. (2022)) . 
Additionally, (Rinaldi, G., Thies, P. R., & Johanning, L. 
(2021))  provides an exhaustive survey of state -of-the-art 
strategies governing the operation and maintenance (O&M) 
planning, as well as the CM of OWFs. This review 
expounds upon benefits, limitations, and envisions 
prospective horizons entailing robotics, artific ial 
intelligence, and data analytics. Moreover, (McMorland, J., 
Flannigan, C., Carroll, J., Collu, M., McMillan, D., 
Leithead, W., & Coraddu, A. (2022) ) undertakes an 
extensive  analysis of the O&M modeling landscape, 
accounting for innovative WT concepts l ike X -rotor and 
multi -rotor designs. The study pinpoints factors such as 
weather dynamics, failure and degradation patterns, vessel 
logistics, cost estimation, and maintenance tactics, as pivotal 
for O&M modeling. Equally noteworthy is (McMorland, J., 
Flannigan, C., Carroll, J., Collu, M., McMillan, D., 
Leithead, W., & Coraddu, A. (2022))  which elucidates 
O&M challenges and research opportunities inherent to WT 
systems. Notable opportunities encompass integrating 
diverse data sources to fine -tune O&M strate gies, precise 
inventory management, nuanced uncertainty modeling, the 
pressing need for standardized open data frameworks, and 
pivotal reference software development.  
To the author's best understanding, the existing exploration 
of challenges and opportunit ies associated with WTs /OWFs  
is primarily limited to treating them as purely technical 
systems. However, this perspective falls short, given that 
OWFs have far -reaching impacts on both society and 
ecology, rendering them as intricate social -ecological -
technical systems (SETS). Consequently, a comprehensive 
examination and analysis of OWFs  as SETS is imperative. 
This paper serves as a foundational step, presenting a 
paradigm shift where OWFs are approached from the SETS 
framework. We present an exploration o f these complex 
systems, unveiling knowledge gaps and charting a trajectory 
for future advancements  within the realm of PHM.  
 
The subsequent sections of this paper are delineated as 
follows. In Section 2, we delve into main  constituents of 
SETS  and describe it in context to OWFs . Section 3 outlines 
and discuss the limitation  within PHM research as applied 
to OWFs  while Section 4 expounds upon prospective 
avenues for future research. Ultimately, Section 5 present 
important conclusion s from the study.  
2. SOCIAL - ECOLOGICAL -TECHNOLOGICAL  SYSTEM S 
2.1. General  
Urban areas, as intricate hubs of human activity, 
infrastructure, and ecological dyn amics, epitomize the interwoven interactions between social, ecological, and 
technological components  (McPhearson, T., Cook, E. M. 
(2022) . Recently, SETS  research has gained traction as a 
new approach to understand urban complexity. SETS are 
characterized by their inherently interdisciplinary nature, 
drawing from a diverse array of disciplines, including 
engineering, ecology, social sciences, economics, an d policy 
analysis  (Ahlborg, H., Ruiz -Mercado, I., Molander, S., & 
Masera, O. (2019) ). It holistically brings together over two 
decades of interdisciplinary work on social -ecological 
systems (SES) and socio -technical systems (STS) to 
advance interdisciplina ry and critical systems approaches to 
urban sustainability and resilience  (Branny, A., Møller, M. 
S., Korpilo, S., McPhearson, T., Gulsrud, N., Olafsson, A. 
S., Raymond, C. M., & Andersson, E. (2022) ).  
At the core of SETS lies the recognition that the int eractions 
between social, ecological, and technological elements are 
far from isolated; rather, they constitute a dynamic and 
integrated network. Social dimensions encompass human 
behavior, cultural norms, governance structures, and 
economic systems. Ecolo gical aspects encompass 
biodiversity, ecosystems, and environmental processes. 
Technological elements comprise innovations, 
infrastructure, and engineering solutions. The essence of 
SETS is the acknowledgement that interventions in one 
dimension inevitably  reverberate across the entire system, 
triggering cascading effects and influencing the equilibrium 
of the entire interconnected network.  Prominent 
frameworks, such as the Social -Ecological System (SES)  
(Partelow, S. (2018) ) framework and Transition 
Manage ment Theory  (Rotmans, J., Kemp, R., & van Asselt, 
M. (2001) ), facilitate the analysis of adaptive capacity, 
transformation pathways, and governance structures within 
SETS.  
The versatility of SETS is evidenced by its wide -ranging 
applications across various  domains. Urban planning and 
design, for instance, benefit from SETS -based assessments 
that optimize human well -being, resource efficiency, and 
ecosystem health  (Colléony, A., & Shwartz, A. (2019) ). 
Agricultural systems leverage SETS insights to devise 
sustainable farming practices that harmonize productivity, 
biodiversity, and socioeconomic equity  (Durán, Y., Gómez -
Valenzuela, V., & Ramírez, K. (2023) ). In the context of 
energy systems, SETS -driven analyses guide the integration 
of renewable technologies, grid management, and 
community engagement.  We shall next discuss the various 
SET interaction s happening while operating and 
maintaining a typical OWF.  
2.2. Social -Technological -Ecological Interactions in 
OWFs  
A typical OWF is a complex SETS  (as shown in Figure 2) 
implying that its functioning and performance are 
influenced by not only the technical aspects but also by the 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEME NT SOCIETY 2023  
4 Non-Technological Factors (NTFs), such as the 
policies/regulations governing the wind farm development, 
the involvement of stakeholders (inclu ding local 
communities, government agencies, industry players, 
management), ethical considerations, and decision -making 
processes throughout the lifecycle of the wind farm.  For 
e.g., while selecting a potential site for OWFs, it is 
necessary to couple tech nical -engineering terms ( e.g., high 
wind energy efficiency, bottom suitability, inland 
infrastructures) with ecological –environmental 
considerations ( e.g., the least possible impact on 
biodiversity, ecosystem functioning) and socio -economic 
aspects ( e.g., effects on coastal and marine activities, 
development of marine spatial planning)  (Soukissian, T., & 
Reizopoulou, S.  (2016)) . 
The integration of SETS insights into OWF O&M strategies 
has far -reaching implications for sustainability and 
resilience. As offshore wind energy continues to expand 
globally, the SETS approach offers a roadmap for 
navigating complex socio -ecological -technical trade -offs. 
By fostering dialogue, collaboration, and adaptive 
governance, OWFs can evolve as catalysts f or sustainable 
energy transition, harmonizing human needs, ecological 
conservation, and technological progress.  The integration of 
ecological assessments in decision -making processes 
ensures the long -term coexistence of offshore wind farms 
with marine ecos ystems. Hence, it is important to recognize 
that OWFs necessitates not only technical prowess but also 
a wider spectrum of attributes, including transparency, 
enhanced social acceptance, and judicious resource 
allocation. By addressing these facets, OWFs c an not only 
thrive technically but also thrive holistically, ultimately 
contributing to a more encompassing sustainability 
paradigm.  
3. LIMITATIONS IN CURRENT PHM  FRAMEWORK FOR 
OWF S 
The PHM framework for a typical OWF is currently facing 
the following researc h gaps:  
1. Lacking Non -Techn ological  Factors  (NTFs) : The 
present state of affairs reveals that the I&M plans 
derived from the  PHM  approach predominantly hinge 
on technical variables such as maximizing Remaining 
Useful Life (RUL) and economic considerations 
centered around cost minimization. This approach, 
however, exhibits a notable gap by failing to account 
for other important  susta inability parameters. other 
NTFs such as community impacts, stakeholder 
engagement, regulatory requirements, and ethical 
considerations which are vital for holistic health 
management of OWFs have not been integrated into the 
PHM framework.  As a result, the  current framework 
might lack the inclusivity needed to comprehensively 
assess the health and performance of the OWFs . Overemphasizing technical factors could lead to an 
incomplete assessment of risks associated with OWF 
operation. While technical failures  are significant, the 
tendency to ignore other important NTFs  could 
potentially translate into suboptimal I&M decision -
making, diminished operational efficiency, and even 
expose the system to latent safety hazards. For instance, 
a turbine failure causing n oise pollution in proximity to 
residential areas might result in community backlash, 
regulatory fines, and project delays, all of which may  
have far -reaching consequences beyond the technical 
domain.   
 
Figure 2. OWF viewed as a complex SETS. 
2. Lacking System Level Perspective (SLP):  A WT is a 
complex electro -mechanical -hydro  system having 
multiple (approximately 8500) components  that 
function collectively to convert  wind energy to 
electrical energy. Some of the vital  subsystems and 
components of a typical WT are  blades, rotor, gearbox, 
generator, yaw, tower, controller, anemometer, break,  
etc. as shown in Fig ure 3. Current application of PHM 
approach for OWFs have been component -centric 
primary focusing on critical co mponents such as 
generators, drivetrain, blades etc. However, in practice 
OWFs have many interdependent components where 
degradation of one component (e.g., main shaft) has a 
cascading effect on other components (e.g., main 
bearing).  Simultaneously, the qu ality of I&M activities, 
performed by technicians also affects the degradation 
rate of the entire system. Nevertheless, currently the 
PHM framework lacks SLP as it fails to integrate the 
interactions between different machine/social elements 
of an OWF.  
3. Lacking Multi -Modal Degradation  (MMD) : Each 
WT component exhibits significant variation in terms 
of how they degrade/fail, due to factors including 
manufacturing variations/defects, operational loading, 
material imperfections, human performance variability 
etc.  In practice, a component undergoes multimodal 
degradation due to failure modes such as cracking, 
fatigue, corrosion, erosion etc., even though it 
undergoes the same operation. However, until now 
most prognostics models have been developed for 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

5 single de gradation modes  (e.g., fatigue, erosion)  by 
using ‘machine related’ quantitative information 
available from sensors and almost no use of quantitative 
or qualitative information derived from human sources 
is taken into consideration.   
 
    Figure  3. Typic al components of Horizontal Axis WT 
4. Non-inclusion of Human and Organizational 
Factors (HOF) Data:  HOF encompass the interactions 
among various components within a system and 
individuals, considering their behaviors. This 
interaction takes place across diff erent levels, including 
individual, situational, group, organizational, or cultural 
levels (Human and Organisational Factors, (2019) ). 
Instances of these interactions can be observed in 
various aspects, such as job design, workload, 
procedures, competence management, working 
conditions, reporting culture, systemic investigations, 
audits, and the safety culture of the organization. As 
depicted in Figure. 4 , the enhancement of railway 
safety, akin to other high -risk industries, initially 
centered on technical reliability  (period from 1960 -
1980) . Subsequently, there was an emphasis on 
formalizing processes through safety management 
systems  (1980 -2000) . While significant strides have 
been made in enhancing safety, progress has begun to 
stabilize, leading to a plateau effect. Presently  (2000 
onwards) , the integration of HOF has emerged as 
paramount to sustaining the trajectory of safety 
improv ement.  
However, as currently practiced, the PHM approach 
prioritizes the hardware aspects of OWFs by collecting 
CM data from physical components and employing data 
analytics/ML techniques to predict and manage its performance and maintenance needs. Neverth eless, 
statistics from the WT manufacturers indicate that 40% 
of WT failures emanate due to HOFs (Interreg IVB 
North Sea Region Programme 2007 -2013, (2015) ). 
These statistics serves as a reminder that, while the 
hardware aspect is undoubtedly important, th e human 
dimension also has a significant influence on the overall 
health and performance of the system . Thus, the current 
trend of neglecting the HOF data within the PHM 
framework limits the effectiveness and holistic 
understanding of the system's health a nd performance.  
    
Figure  4. Factors responsible for reducing accident 
rate in high -risk industries (Human and Organisational 
Factors, (2019) ). 
5. Inefficient Uncertainty Management:   In the context 
to PHM of an OWF, uncertainty can arise from various 
sources, such as measurement/modelling errors, limited 
data, variability in operating conditions and errors 
during human interaction with WT. Although, many 
researchers have focused on analyzing uncertainty 
arising due to technological factors [ 12, 28], still none 
of the studies have quantified uncertainties emanating  
due to NTFs. Furthermore, uncertainty propagation and 
management while considering SLP also requires 
thorough investigation and research.  
6. Lacking Ecological Considerations:   OWFs are often 
part of larger marine environments, and it is vital to 
comprehend their interactions with adjacent ecosystems 
(Galparsoro, I., Menchaca, I., Garmendia, J. M., Borja, 
N., Maldonado, A. D., Iglesias, G., & Bald, J. (2022) ). 
It is a consensus  that the growth of  OWFs should not 
lead to significant environmental harm nor compromise 
environmental objectives, rather its O&M should be 
compatible with biodiversity protection and 
conservation objectives (e.g., SDG 14, Life Below 
Water). The current m onitoring, assessment, and 
maintenance strategies fail to adequately address the 
potential ecological consequences due to these 
activities; thus, further research is needed to assess the 
cumulative impacts of multiple wind farms in an area, 
considering fac tors such as habitat fragmentation, 
displacement of species, and changes in ecological 
dynamics. Integrating ecological considerations into a 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

6 PHM framework would preserve ecosystem 
connectivity, promote biodiversity, mitigate potential 
negative cumulative effects of OWFs on multi -species 
populations, and ensure the long -term viability of 
offshore wind energy as a renewable and ecologically 
friendly power source.  
 
In light of these examples, it is clear that a recalibration of 
PHM approach for OWFs is impera tive. Recognizing the 
multifaceted interactions between technical, non -technical, 
and socio -ecological components can lead to more holistic 
and effective PHM strategies that address the complexities 
of offshore wind energy systems comprehensively.  With 
this as background author  now discuss es the future research 
directions in the PHM domain in context to OWFs.  
4. FUTURE DIRECTIONS  
Applying the SETS framework to O&M  of OWFs  
necessitates a multidisciplinary perspective, drawing from 
fields such as environmental science, engineering, 
economics, sociology, and policy studies. The SES 
framework, combined with Complex Adaptive Systems 
theory, provides a robust foundation for comp rehending the 
resilience, adaptability, and transformative potential of 
OWF O&M systems. Ethical considerations, stakeholder 
engagement, and ecosystem -based management would 
further contribute to a holistic understanding of O&M  
strategies for the OWF  withi n SETS  context . There is the 
need to transcend disciplinary silos and facilitate an 
integrated approach that aligns technological developments 
with ecological sustainability and social well -being . 
In line with the limitations in the PHM framework, possible 
future research direction along with relevant methods are 
given in Table 1. AI and ML would also play a pivotal role 
in advancing each of these research directions as they enable 
the analysis of large datasets, pattern recognition, and 
predictive modeling, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency 
of PHM strategies. Some examples of AI/ML integration 
include:  
1. Lacking Non -Technological Factors (NTFs):  Natural 
Language Processing (NLP) t echniques, sentiment 
analysis, and social network analysis can be used to 
analyze stakeholder sentiments, engagement patterns, 
and communication effectiveness. Machine learning 
algorithms like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting  
can quantify the impact of  NTFs on overall system 
performance.  
2. Lacking System Level Perspective (SLP):  Complex 
system modeling techniques such as Agent -Based 
Modeling and System Dynamics can simulate 
interdependencies between components and assess their 
effects on system health. Ma chine learning methods 
like Autoencoders can capture hidden relationships 
between components.  3. Lacking Multimodal Degradation:  Multimodal AI 
models using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) 
can learn the multimodal degradation patterns from 
combined sens or data and human feedback. Supervised 
machine learning algorithms like Support Vector 
Machines (SVMs) can classify different degradation 
modes using a variety of input features.  
4. Non-inclusion of HOF Data:  NLP can extract insights 
from textual data such as incident reports, maintenance 
logs, and safety culture assessments. Supervised 
Machine Learning models can predict failure 
probabilities considering both technical and HOF 
features.  
5. Inefficient Uncertainty Management:  Bayesian 
networks can model un certainties arising from both 
technological and NTFs. Deep Learning methods like 
Long Short -Term Memory (LSTM) networks can 
predict uncertainty propagation over time.  
6. Lacking Ecological Considerations:  Geographic 
Information System (GIS) combined with AI c an 
analyze spatial and temporal ecological impacts. 
Machine Learning algorithms like Gaussian Process  can 
predict ecological changes based on various factors 
including wind farm operations and marine ecosystem 
dynamics.  
 
Incorporating AI/ML techniques with the respective 
methods would enhances the accuracy, speed, and 
scalability of PHM strategies, leading to more effective and 
sustainable O&M practices in OWFs .

7 5. CONCLUSION  
In conclusion, this study sheds light on the limitations and 
untapped opportunities within the PHM fram ework for 
OWFs, viewed through a Socio -Technical -Ecological 
System (SETS) perspective. The identified research gaps 
underscore the necessity for a paradigm shift in the 
approach towards OWF management. The existing over -
reliance on technical factors in the  PHM framework 
presents a pressing need to integrate NTFs encompassing 
socio -cultural and organizational aspects. Such inclusion 
would broaden the scope of decision -making by accounting 
for community impacts, stakeholder engagement, regulatory 
compliance, and ethical considerations, which collectively 
contribute to the holistic health and performance of OWFs.  
Furthermore, the current framework's limitation in 
considering the system as a whole (System Level 
Perspective) accentuates the requirement for a 
comprehensive approach that captures the intricate 
interdependencies among various components and their 
cumulative impact on system health. This entails embracing 
a holistic viewpoint that  fuses  machine -related data with 
human -related data, thereby fosteri ng a more accurate 
representation of system behavior and degradation modes. 
Additionally, managing  uncertainty  stemming from both 
technological and NTFs  emerges as an imperative  and needs 
further exploration . Since OWFs  coexist within larger 
marine ecosyst ems, integrating ecological considerations 
into the PHM framework will be crucial in aligning OWF 
operations with biodiversity protection objectives, thereby 
ensuring their long -term sustainability.  
In this pursuit, author emphasize d on not only advancing the 
existing technical models but also embracing AI/ML 
methods for effective integration of NTFs and ecological 
parameters. The path forward entails forging collaborations 
among engineering, social sciences, and environmental 
disciplines to devise a compre hensive PHM framework that 
upholds the complex interplay of technical, social, and 
ecological factors. This transformative approach stands 
poised to chart er new horizons for advancing the PHM 
framework for OWFs , enhancing their reliability, 
sustainability, a nd contribution to the clean energy 
landscape.
