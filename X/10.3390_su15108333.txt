Abstract: Power generation from wind farms is growing rapidly around the world. In the past decade,
wind energy has played an important role in contributing to sustainable development. However,
wind turbines are extremely susceptible to component damage under complex environments and
over long-term operational cycles, which directly affects their maintenance, reliability, and operating
costs. It is crucial to realize efÔ¨Åcient early warning of wind turbine failure to avoid equipment
breakdown, to prolong the service life of wind turbines, and to maximize the revenue and efÔ¨Åciency
of wind power projects. For this purpose, wind turbines are used as the research object. Firstly, this
paper outlines the main components and failure mechanisms of wind turbines and analyzes the
causes of equipment failure. Secondly, a brief analysis of the cost of wind power projects based on
equipment failure is presented. Thirdly, the current key technologies for intelligent operation and
maintenance (O&M) in the wind power industry are discussed, and the key research on decision
support systems, fault diagnosis models, and life-cycle costs is presented. Finally, current challenges
and future development directions are summarized.
Keywords: wind energy industry; equipment failure; operation and maintenance cost; intelligent
operation and maintenance technology
1. Introduction
Wind energy generation is an important measure to develop a circular economy
and to alleviate resource constraints [ 1]. In contrast to the substantial consumption and
environmental pollution brought on by traditional energy sources, wind energy, as a
technology for electricity conversion using renewable resources, does not generate pollution
during power generation [ 2]. It is therefore of great importance in terms of energy savings
and emission reduction. Over the long term, the economic and environmental beneÔ¨Åts
of wind energy are superior to those of conventional power, and its energy conservation
and emission reduction are outstanding, setting a new trend in the future development of
electric power generation and thus establishing a clear trend for the future development
of electric power [ 3]. According to statistics from the Global Wind Energy Council, the
operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of wind turbines can be as much as 10% to 20% of
the total electricity produced and as much as 20% to 25% of the total electricity produced
by offshore wind turbines [4].
Wind energy O&M costs primarily comprise routine maintenance costs, breakdown
maintenance costs, spare part purchase costs, insurance premiums, and administrative
costs. Offshore wind turbines cost about three times as much to run as their onshore
counterparts. The difÔ¨Åculty and cost of maintenance has increased with the advent of
large-capacity offshore wind turbines. The cost of operating and maintaining an offshore
wind farm accounts for around 40% of the total life-cycle cost of the project. The cost
structure of offshore wind energy O&M is shown in Figure 1 [ 5]. High failure rates and

2.1. Analysis of Main Components in Wind Turbine
The main components used in a wind turbine are as follows.
 Blade
In wind turbines, the blades absorb wind energy. They are often made of Ô¨Åber-
reinforced composite materials. In the Ô¨Çow Ô¨Åeld, the blade generates upward lift force
through the pressure difference given by the wind Ô¨Åeld to the upper and lower surfaces,
thus driving the rotation of the wind wheel and converting mechanical energy into electrical
energy [8].
 Pitch System
The pitch system is the central component of any large wind turbine control system. It
adjusts the angle of the blades, maximizing the wind energy output of the wind turbine. To
a large extent, the variable paddle system guarantees the working reliability of the wind
turbine [9].
 Gear box
Gearboxes generally consist of gears, bearings, shafts, and other parts. The quality
and design of the gears directly affect the reliability, service life, and operating efÔ¨Åciency
of the gearbox [ 10]. Wind turbine gearboxes are usually made of high-strength, low-alloy
steel materials, which are treated with precision heat treatment and surface strengthening
processes to improve their load-bearing capacity and wear resistance. In general, wind
turbine gearboxes are designed for a service life of about 20 years, while requiring low
noise, low vibration, and reliable operation [11].
 Yaw system
The yaw system is used to control the vectoring of the wind turbine in the direction
of the wind to ensure that the wind turbine is always in the best position. The wind yaw
system consists of a wind sensor, a control system, and an actuator [ 12]. The wind sensor
is responsible for detecting the wind direction. The control system compares the wind
direction signal with the set value and adjusts the orientation angle of the wind turbine
via the actuator so that it always maintains a certain angle from the wind direction, thus
maximizing the wind energy available for power generation [ 13]. The design and operation
of the wind turbine yaw system is extremely important, as it has a direct impact on the
operating efÔ¨Åciency and power generation of the wind turbine. Therefore, the yaw system
requires sensitive response and high accuracy, as well as strong durability, anti-interference
capability, and adaptability to different climatic environments [14].
Wind turbines work by converting wind energy into mechanical energy, which is
then converted into electrical energy through a gearbox. As the wind turbine rotates, it
drives the main shaft, which turns the generator through the gearbox and transmits the
electrical energy to the grid [ 15]. However, due to complex mechanical structures and
harsh environments, wear in wind turbine components such as the blades, the hubs, the
gearboxes, and the pitch systems is inevitable and wind turbines are at risk of failure at
any time, leading to a signiÔ¨Åcant increase in their operating and maintenance costs. The
purpose of a fault analysis is to determine the cause of the fault; to clearly understand the
nature, location, and reason for the fault; and to take targeted maintenance actions to ensure
normal operation of the wind turbine while reducing cost and maintaining efÔ¨Åciency [16].
Therefore, a timely fault analysis is important for wind turbines.
2.2. Analysis of Common Faults in Wind Turbines
In the past, in order to meet the requirements of wind energy generation, wind farms
were usually built at sea or in remote mountainous areas and thus operated in extremely
harsh environments [ 17]. As an important part of a wind farm, a wind turbine is bound to
suffer from the harsh environment. Unpredictable loads due to dust, humidity, temperature,
air pressure, and wind gusts can subject the main load-bearing components in the unit to
severely alternating loads, making the blades and towers highly susceptible to tribological

effects such as wear, fatigue, and corrosion, thus leading to unit failure [ 18]. However, new
problems arose as the number of industrial wind turbine installations increased. Some
failures are due to damage to the wind turbine and exceeding the design fatigue limit,
while others are due to new failure modes as a result of material ageing, manufacturing
defects, and changes in rotor size standards. The number of accidents is also increasing as
the number of onshore and offshore wind turbines increases [19].
Figure 3 shows the number of cases of damage to wind turbines around the world
from 2000 to 2017. It shows that as the number of wind turbines installed around the world
has increased, so has the number of accidents. The number of wind turbine accidents
averaged 57 per year from 2000 to 2005 and increased to 118 per year from 2006 to 2010.
Furthermore, between 2013 and 2017, the total number of accidents per year rose even
higher, to 167 [20].

Figure 3. Annual statistics of global wind turbine failures [20]. 
Common types of failure in wind turbines include blade failure, gearbox failure, 
pitch system failure, and yaw system failure. The common fault characteristics and causes 
are summarized as follows.  
‚Ä¢ Failure of blade  
The cost of manufacturing wind turbine blades is approximately 15% to 20% of the 
total cost of the turbin e [21]. Usually , the blade as a whole is exposed in the field, and 
working conditions can be harsh. These conditions include high altitude s; atmospheric 
radiation ; sand and dust ; lightning ; heavy rain ; freezing rain or ice , and snow ; salt corro-
sion; and typhoons.  Such variable conditions can result in blade failure events; thus , blade 
condition monitoring, early warning systems, and effective O&M analys es are increas-
ingly important [22]. 
The common failure modes of blades are (1) fracture and cracking failu re; (2) damage 
caused by lightning strikes; and (3) local surface abrasion, cracks, etc. Blade failure is often 
accompanied by defects such as folding, poor curing, and unequal layering [23]. The 
causes of blade failure are analyzed below.  
(a) Failure of fract ure and cracking  
‚Ä¢ Design defects  
The design of some blades leads to safety issues, including the blade root and blade 
middle section area being too small, the section shape not meeting strength and stiffness 
requirements, and the blade‚Äôs actual operating lo ad exceeding the design of the predicted 
limit. Figure 4a shows design defects causing blade fracture. In addition, the redundancy 
amount of each component of the wind turbine , and the spacing and mass of the blades

limit. Figure 4a shows design defects causing blade fracture. In addition, the redundancy
amount of each component of the wind turbine, and the spacing and mass of the blades are
often insufÔ¨Åcient in the design. For example, the wind energy capture rate will be reduced
if the blade spacing is too large. Due to disturbance in the airÔ¨Çow between the blades, there
will be air leakage and the wind energy cannot be fully utilized. Additionally, there will be
an increase in the volatility of the turbine, and then, the stability will become worse. If the
distance between the blades is too small, it will cause the blades to interfere with each other
and produce their mutual inÔ¨Çuence. This will not only reduce the efÔ¨Åciency of using wind
energy but also cause the turbine to become overloaded and unsafe. Moreover, a blade
spacing that is too small will also increase the amount of vibration in the unit, accelerate
fatigue failure of the unit, and affect the service life of the unit, leading to problems during
operation [24,25].
 Leaf material quality does not meet requirements
Manufacturers often use unqualiÔ¨Åed gel-coat, resin, or Ô¨Åber materials, which have
poor homogeneity and are prone to local soft ribs, leading to sudden leaf failure [26].
 Change in production technology without authorization
At present, high-quality composite blades are mostly manufactured via PRIM (polyamine
reaction injection molding), RTM (resin transfer molding), winding, prepreg, or hot-
pressing processes. However, some manufacturers use hand-paste processes to reduce costs
and to gain market advantages. This phenomenon leads to uneven glue content, poor Ô¨Åber
penetration, and incomplete curing of the blade during production, resulting in problems
such as blade deformation and breakage [27].
 Inexperienced manufacturers
Some manufacturers have insufÔ¨Åcient experience, unclear control protocols, and
simple methods. Faced with hundreds of main and auxiliary materials, tools, tooling
processes, molds, and equipment involved in blade manufacturing, quality and production
control is often lacking and inspections are limited to the surface, which cannot guarantee
blade quality [28].
(b) Damage caused by lightning strikes
With the majority of wind energy plants being installed in the open countryside
and in mountainous regions, in addition to the longer operating time of plants and the
deeper soiling of blade surfaces, wind energy plants are increasingly affected by lightning
strikes [ 29]. Figure 4b shows a blade damaged by a lightning strike. Failure due to lightning
strikes on a blade is common at the lightning catcher and other parts of the blade [30].
 Cracks in the lightning conductor and blades
The cementation between the lightning initiator and the blade is not strong, and rain or
moisture absorption can occur, changing the path of mine induction [ 31]. When lightning
strikes the blade, the huge energy released by the lightning leads to a sharp increase in the
temperature of the water-soaked material in the blade structure; then, the decomposed gas
expands at high temperature, and the pressure rises, resulting in damage [32].
 Fouled blade surface
Dust deposition corrodes the blade surface, accelerating blade surface weathering,
burrowing, and elastic weakening and resulting in micro-cracks. These cracks lead to
further corrosion from dust, and mixtures formed by electrostatic dust accelerate blade
corrosion again [33].
(c) Local surface abrasion and cracking
Local surface abrasions occur mainly on the tip-windward side, the mid-windward
side, the leading edge, and the trailing edge of a blade, as shown in Figure 4c [34].
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Sustainability 2023 ,15, 8333 6 of 35
 Abrasion by wind sand and water vapor
A rotating blade will produce friction and collision with particles (dust and water
vapor) in the air [ 35]. In most cases, the tip velocity of the blade exceeds 70 m/s. At this
speed, the particles in the air will cause wear and tear on the leading edge of the blade and
vortex abrasion on the trailing edge. Though the leaves worn by gravel Ô¨Årst appear to be
depressed, this depression is actually due to tiny sand holes, and the ageing of materials is
greatly accelerated following the formation of sand holes [ 36]. Water is stored in these sand
holes, and humidity in the depressions increases; thus, this greatly increases the possibility
of the blade being damaged by lightning [37].
 High-speed wind, shear wind, bad weather, and fatigue life
Although blades stop rotating when wind speeds exceed the limit, high-speed winds,
shear winds, or high gusts can cause the blade load to exceed the design load, resulting
in blade damage. Severe weather such as heavy rain, snow, and hail can also cause leaf
damage. With the extension of the service cycle of the blade, the anti-fatigue ability of the
blade is weakened, which will also lead to blade damage [38].

 and vortex abrasion on the trailing edge. Though the leaves worn by gravel first appear 
to be depressed, this depression is actually due to tiny sand holes , and the ageing of ma-
terials is greatly accelerated following the formation of sand holes [36]. Water is stored in 
these sand holes, and humidity in the depressions increases; thus, this greatly increase s 
the possibility of the blade being damaged by lightning [37]. 
‚Ä¢ High-speed wind, shear wind, bad weather, and fatigue life  
Although blades stop rotating when wind speeds exceed the limit, high -speed winds, 
shear winds, or high gusts can cause the blade load to exceed the design load, resulting in 
blade damage. Severe weather such as heavy rain, snow, and hail can also cause leaf dam-
age. With the e xtension of the service cycle of the blade, the anti -fatigue ability of the blade 
is weakened, which will also lead to blade damage [38].

damaged blad e failure [30]; (c) locally abraded blade [34]. 
‚Ä¢ Failure of gearbox  
The gearbox contains a large number of gears, and failure of the gears accounts for 
about 60% of total gearbox failures. Failure of the gears is mainly concentrated in the teeth, 
including tooth surface corrosion, tooth surface wear, tooth surface bonding, and broken 
teeth [39]. 
(a) Tooth surface corrosion  
As shown in Figure 5a ,b, tooth surface corrosion mainly includes rust and electric 
corrosion. The most common chemical rust is tooth surface rust, which is mainly due to 
the excessive water content of lubricating oil s or long-term high humidity from air inside 
the gear box, which mostly occurs in areas with abundant summer rain [40]. Corrosion 
occurs when the gear surfaces are in close contact and there is little movement between 
the gears (generally, an amplitude of movement less than 120 Œºm). Under such conditions, 
the film of the lubricating oil between the gear teeth cracks due to compression, which 
leads to direct contact between th e metals and results in adhesion of the micro -bulges on to 
the gear surface. Under these relatively small movements, there can be tearing of the gear 
contact surface by fusion welding adhesion as well as the production of a fine reddish -
brown iron oxide pow der similar in color to coffee beans. As a result, the gear develops 
abrasive wear. During this process, close contact between debris or worn edges of the gear 
will further prevent lubricating oil from reaching the surface of the gear. Corrosion results 
in deterioration over time and often occurs in relatively stationary gear drives.

surface. Under these relatively small movements, there can be tearing of the gear contact
surface by fusion welding adhesion as well as the production of a Ô¨Åne reddish-brown
iron oxide powder similar in color to coffee beans. As a result, the gear develops abrasive
wear. During this process, close contact between debris or worn edges of the gear will
further prevent lubricating oil from reaching the surface of the gear. Corrosion results in

Figure 5. Tooth surface corrosion [40]. (a) Tooth surface corrosion; ( b) electric corrosion of tooth 
surface.  
(b) Tooth surface wear  
Tooth surface wear can be divided into micro -pitting, macro -pitting, tooth surface 
spalling, and fretting wear according to different causes and levels of severity [41]. 
Micro-pitting, also known as gray spot, is a gray damage phenomenon appearing on 
the tooth surface of the gear during long -term eng agement, as shown in Figure 6a [42,43]. 
The causes of wear are relatively complex. It is generally believed that due to problems in 
machining accuracy during gear handling, there are tiny bumps on the surface of the 
teeth, which results in the oil film not  covering 100% of the gear surface or the thickness 
of the cover being insufficient. During meshing of these bumps, the teeth suffer from fric-
tion and shear stress, fatigue, and local overheating, resulting in micro -pitting.  
Macro-pitting is the formation of small potholes when the gear contact surface is split 
by fatigue. Not only relative rolling but also relative sliding occurs during gear meshing. 
Due to material defects or excessive short -term load s caused by the impact force of the 
gear, the shear str ess generated by relative sliding of the tooth surface will exceed the 
fatigue limit of the material for a short time, and fatigue cracks will occur on the tooth 
surface [44]. As the operation continues, the crack expands, and eventually , metal particles 
begin to flake off at the crack boundary; this phenomenon is called macroscopic pitting 
[45]. Figure 6b shows the gear damage caused by macroscopic pitting on the tooth surface 
[46]. If the fatigue crack continues to expand, eventually there will be massive  spallation 
of the surface.  
Fretting wear, also known as a ‚Äúblack line‚Äù, is a composite type of wear generated 
between metal surfaces that are pressed together, as shown in Figure 6c [47]. The reason 
for this wear is that the gearbox stops running for a n extended period of time, and the 
tooth surface above the lubricating oil level does not receive lubrication. Small vibrations 
bring about constant reciprocal meshing between the gears, and alternating contact 
stresses appear; a black line will appear on the  tooth surface of the gear bite. With time, 
pitting and even cracks will gradually appear from fretting wear due to high temperatures 
and oil shortages; subsequently, a tooth fracture will occur [48].

(c) Tooth surface gluing  
Tooth surface gluing is the direct contact between two tooth surfaces due to rupture 
of the oil film under pressure, which resu lts in adhesion and tearing. Depending on the 
mechanism of production, there are two types of gluing: hot gluing and cold gluing [49]. 
In the event of gear wear, vibration , or overload, the worn gear surface will generate high 
frictional heat. At this time , if the lubricant temperature is too high, the oil film fails and 
the tooth surfaces come into direct contact, resulting in thermoplastic deformation. Even 
if the lubrication is restored and the deformation produced by the tooth surface is memo-
rized, the tooth surface will continue to undergo thermoplastic modulus deformation, 
which is also known as the gear hot glue phenomenon [50]. Cold gluing is caused by the 
low sliding speed of the gear. The meshing part thus does not easily form an oil film, 
resulting in a local pressure increase. The two contact surfaces of the oil film are punc-
tured, resulting in adhesion tear [51]. 
(d) Broken g ear teeth  
Broken g ear teeth include fatigue -broken teeth and overload -broken teeth, as shown 
in Figure 7a ,b [52]. This is failure caused by alternating loads exceeding the fatigue limit 
of materials [53]. Fatigue fractures can be divided into three zones: the fatigue crack source 
zone, the crack extension zone, and the transient fracture zone. Their development proc ess 
can be roughly divided into root bending stress, initial fatigue crack, continuous crack 
propagation, and tooth fracture [54]. An overload fracture occurs when the load on the 
tooth surface is greater than the maximum load. The macroscopic characterist ics of the 
fracture are the same as that for a tensile fracture in the material, with a pronounced crin-
kling phenomenon. The development process of overload -broken teeth can be roughly 
divided into local tooth fracture caused by short -term overload impact, local fracture of 
gear with smaller tooth width, and fracture of helical gear or spur gear with larger tooth 
width [55].

(c) Tooth surface gluing
Tooth surface gluing is the direct contact between two tooth surfaces due to rupture
of the oil Ô¨Ålm under pressure, which results in adhesion and tearing. Depending on the
mechanism of production, there are two types of gluing: hot gluing and cold gluing [ 49].
In the event of gear wear, vibration, or overload, the worn gear surface will generate high
frictional heat. At this time, if the lubricant temperature is too high, the oil Ô¨Ålm fails and the
tooth surfaces come into direct contact, resulting in thermoplastic deformation. Even if the
lubrication is restored and the deformation produced by the tooth surface is memorized,
the tooth surface will continue to undergo thermoplastic modulus deformation, which is
also known as the gear hot glue phenomenon [ 50]. Cold gluing is caused by the low sliding
speed of the gear. The meshing part thus does not easily form an oil Ô¨Ålm, resulting in a
local pressure increase. The two contact surfaces of the oil Ô¨Ålm are punctured, resulting in
adhesion tear [51].
(d) Broken gear teeth
Broken gear teeth include fatigue-broken teeth and overload-broken teeth, as shown
in Figure 7a,b [ 52]. This is failure caused by alternating loads exceeding the fatigue limit
of materials [ 53]. Fatigue fractures can be divided into three zones: the fatigue crack
source zone, the crack extension zone, and the transient fracture zone. Their development
process can be roughly divided into root bending stress, initial fatigue crack, continuous
crack propagation, and tooth fracture [ 54]. An overload fracture occurs when the load on
the tooth surface is greater than the maximum load. The macroscopic characteristics of
the fracture are the same as that for a tensile fracture in the material, with a pronounced
crinkling phenomenon. The development process of overload-broken teeth can be roughly
divided into local tooth fracture caused by short-term overload impact, local fracture of
gear with smaller tooth width, and fracture of helical gear or spur gear with larger tooth
width [55].
 Failure of pitch system
There are three main forms of failure in the pitch system.
(a) Pitch shaft cabinet battery under voltage
If there is a failure of the pitch shaft cabinet battery, it is possible that one of the
batteries in the fan blade battery cabinet has been damaged due to prolonged use or that
the battery charging circuit is faulty, in which case the battery power provided by the
battery cabinet is below the critical lower limit, and the paddle cannot change pitch [ 56,57].
(b) Abnormal hub detection data
If the hub detection data are abnormal, the wind turbine‚Äôs pitch communication system
will fail. The wind turbine nacelle and hub communicate via a bus of electrical slip rings.
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

When wind turbines are operated for long periods of time, problems in communication
due to foreign objects or slip ring failures may occur [58‚Äì60].
(c) Paddle angle deviation exceeds limit
The rotation angle of the paddles can exceed the lower or upper limit of the pre-
set paddle angle due to rotation overruns during operation or shutdown of the wind
turbine [61,62].
 Failure of yaw system
The yaw system is an important components of a wind turbine. Its function is to track
the change in wind direction and to drive the nacelle to rotate around the central axis of the
tower, so that the wind turbine is always in the windward position [ 63]. In the course of
wind energy O&M, faults in the yaw system constantly appear, especially in the mechanical
parts, which are characterized by frequent maintenance difÔ¨Åculties and various types of
faults [64]. Common failures in wind turbine yaw systems are as follows.

of materials [53]. Fatigue fractures can be divided into three zones: the fatigue crack source

(a) Abnormal noise
 Yaw drive motor
Yaw drive motor issues include the following: the motor rotor adopts a sealed bearing;
the bearing lubricating oil deteriorates due to age [ 65,66]; the raceway, roller, and bearing
cage of the bearing are damaged; the position of the brake grinding disc at the rear of the
motor is not correct; the grinding disc is worn; and the cooling blade is broken or the blade
is rubbing the rear end cover of the motor [67].
 Yaw transmission
Yaw transmission issues include the following: a lack of lubricating oil or deterioration
of the lubricating oil in the planetary gear train of yaw transmission; excessive content
of mechanical impurities in the lubricating oil; transmission bearing damage; a lack of
lubricating grease in the transmission; and yaw gear occlusion [68].
 Yaw big gear ring
Gear ring issues include the following: the lubrication grease on the tooth surface of
the gear ring can be inÔ¨Åltrated by sand; the positioning pin or Ô¨Åxing bolt assembling the
rack of the big gear ring is loose; and the big gear ring is broken [69,70].
 Yaw gear pair Ô¨Åt clearance
Each blade yaw mechanism is provided with two to four yaw drivers [ 71]. If the Ô¨Åt
clearance between the drive gear and the yaw gear with large ring teeth is uneven, noise
from the gear bite clearance is likely to occur during yaw [72].
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Sustainability 2023 ,15, 8333 10 of 35
 Yaw bearing
There are two types of yaw bearings: sliding bearings and rolling bearings [ 73]. Due to
the low speed of the yaw bearings and the lack of lubricating grease in the rolling bearings,
the bearings are corroded by the current, causing scorching of the bearing rollers [ 74].
The sliders in the sliding bearings are made of TeÔ¨Çon material, and some are lined with
friction-reducing material between the sliders and the slewing disc; noise can come from
slider failure [75].
 Yaw brake
Cracks in the friction discs, faulty adjustment of the caliper body compensation device,
and uneven damping torque values in the brake are caused by excessive damping pressure
in the yaw brake or by the presence of sand and mechanical impurities on the friction
surface [76].
(b) Yaw drive machinery is stuck
First, yaw motor bearings are sealed bearings, and staff are unable to regularly re-
plenish the lubricant; this results in fatigue damage to the bearings due to high and low
temperature differences [ 77‚Äì79]. Second, the yaw drive is mounted vertically, with the yaw
drive bearing at the lower end. The bearing carries a large inertial force from the large gear
ring, and mechanical magazines within the drive tend to enter the bearing gap [ 80]. Third,
the yaw drive gear is susceptible to over-torque damage at the moment of start or stop of
the yaw system, especially during gusts in periods of high wind [ 81]. Fourth, the sliding
yaw bearing liner can crack. This failure is related to the quality of the liner material and
the yaw caliper balancing torque [82].
(c) Inaccurate yaw positioning
Inaccurate yaw positioning can be caused by brake failure of the yaw motor, insufÔ¨Å-
cient yaw braking pressure, and low yaw braking torque values [ 83,84]. Broken teeth of the
yaw gear ring and yaw drive device are shown in Figure 8a,b [85,86].

3. Cost Analysis of Intelligent Operation and Maintenance for Wind Energy
The main purpose of a wind power intelligent O&M cost analysis is to determine the
cost structure and scale of this O&M, to evaluate its feasibility, and to provide important
guidance and reference for its implementation. First, by analyzing the cost structure and
scale of wind power intelligent O&M, the speciÔ¨Åc costs and budgets for each phase can
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Sustainability 2023 ,15, 8333 12 of 35
be understood; this is conducive to achieving more effective cost control and budget
management. Second, a cost analysis can evaluate the feasibility and economic beneÔ¨Åts
of wind power intelligent O&M and can clarify whether there is a commercial value and
market prospect for investment. In addition, a cost analysis can provide speciÔ¨Åc guidance
and reference for the implementation of intelligent O&M, including equipment selection,
personnel training, management processes, and other aspects. At the same time, based on
the analysis results, a more scientiÔ¨Åc and reasonable implementation plan can be developed,
improving the efÔ¨Åciency and success rate of intelligent O&M implementation. Without a
cost analysis in the early stage of implementation, it is impossible to determine a sustainable
business model.
3.1. Analysis of Wind Power Intelligent Operation and Maintenance Cost Components
Currently, intelligent O&M for wind turbines can be broken down into online moni-
toring and diagnosis and ofÔ¨Çine maintenance [ 87]. The online monitoring and diagnosis
system mainly includes three functions: intelligent detection, intelligent maintenance, and
advanced application [ 29]. The intelligent detection function will comprehensively monitor
the performance parameters and power parameters of online and ofÔ¨Çine blade equipment
and upload the monitoring data to the wind farm and headquarters [ 88]. The intelligent
maintenance function classiÔ¨Åes the data signals collected from all dimensions of the device
blade to detect major faults or hidden dangers during device operation in a timely manner.
Advanced application functions include multi-angle and overall data analyses and intelli-
gent judgments on the problems arising during equipment detection and maintenance and
reasonably estimate the possible problems based on large-scale data mining [89].
To ensure that equipment and systems work stably and safely during normal operation
of a wind energy project, wind farm staff also need to regularly maintain and inspect
wind turbines; these costs are known as the maintenance costs [ 90]. For onshore wind
farms, maintenance costs for wind turbines include maintenance personnel costs, material
costs, and technical transformation costs [ 91]. Maintenance costs vary depending on the
type of equipment used on a wind farm. Maintenance costs refer to the total cost of
manual inspection and repair in order to restore the wind turbine to normal operation after
failure, including labor, machinery, and spare parts costs [ 92]. For different types of wind
turbines, the recovery rate and utilization rate of equipment failure are different, as are the
maintenance costs [ 93]. The O&M of offshore wind farms differs signiÔ¨Åcantly from that of
onshore wind farms, and these points of difference clearly affect the cost of offshore wind
O&M [94].
The cost of intelligent O&M for wind power installations consists of seven components,
as shown in Table 2.
Table 2. Components of the intelligent O&M costs for wind power systems.
Cost Type Cost Content
Hardware costsThe cost of hardware equipment required by wind power intelligent
O&M software, such as servers and data storage devices [95]
Software costsCopyright fee and usage fee for wind power intelligent O&M
software [96]
Labor costsLabor maintenance costs, including technical support, system
updates, etc., as well as labor costs for maintaining wind power
equipment [97]
Communication costs Communication costs related to intelligent O&M [98]
Monitoring
equipment costsThe cost of monitoring and testing equipment, such as sensors and
measuring equipment [99]
Operating costsIncludes costs for manpower, materials, and funds required for daily
operation management, supervision, maintenance, and
troubleshooting; predictive maintenance and scheduled maintenance;
coordination and organizational management [100]
Training costsThe cost of training personnel to use intelligent wind power O&M
systems, including the cost of training facilities and labor costs [101]

3.2. Analysis of Wind Power Intelligent Operation and Maintenance Cost Control
As the scale of wind power development continues to expand, traditional maintenance
methods are becoming obsolete. First, the wind farm station service environment is
harsh and largely unattended, and manual inspection is difÔ¨Åcult and costly. Second,
the unit is scattered and complex, with variable operating conditions and low reliability,
resulting in maintenance difÔ¨Åculties. Third, the high cost of repair and replacement of large
components accounts for a high proportion of the infrastructure and power generation
costs. Fourth, regular maintenance is not timely, and after-the-fact maintenance affects the
overall efÔ¨Åciency of power generation [ 102‚Äì104]. Compared with traditional maintenance
technologies, wind power intelligent O&M technology uses big data, artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence,
and other technologies to manage systems more efÔ¨Åciently and to ensure their safety and
stability through automatic monitoring and preventive measures. In addition, this O&M
technology can address issues faster and more efÔ¨Åciently, thus reducing downtime and
losses, lowering maintenance and repair costs, and improving the sustainability of wind
power generation systems [105,106].
However, with the large-scale development in the past decade, wind power generation
technology has matured in various aspects, such as model design, micro-siting, construc-
tion and installation, and operation and control; as a result, problems have gradually
increased, and the cost of wind power intelligent O&M has also increased [ 107]. Wind
power intelligent O&M requires signiÔ¨Åcant technical investment, including software and
hardware equipment and network communications infrastructure. Such devices must
be constantly updated and maintained, and they require professional technical staff to
manage, operate, and maintain equipment [ 108]. Intelligent O&M requires the collection
and processing of data from numerous sensors to detect equipment failures and to provide
early warning. These data require long-term storage, analysis, and processing, which
necessitates appropriate storage equipment and data analysis software [ 109]. Again, in-
telligent O&M requires professional technicians for such maintenance and management,
and personnel must have advanced technical skills and professionalism. Therefore, com-
panies need to invest appropriate human resources and funds for recruitment, training,
and management [ 110]. Finally, intelligent O&M requires continuous equipment updates
and maintenance to ensure equipment performance and reliability. These updates and
maintenance require a large amount of capital and human resources [111].
As shown in Figure 10, between 2018 and 2022, the number of wind turbines installed
in China increased from 62,000 to 117,000, while the cost of wind power intelligent O&M
increased from USD 14.7 billion to USD 20.1 billion. It can be predicted that the cost of
wind power intelligent O&M will continue to rise in the next Ô¨Åve years, suggesting an
urgent need to control the cost of wind power intelligent O&M [112].
As the cost of wind power intelligent O&M increases year by year, more and more
scholars in the Ô¨Åeld are conducting in-depth research on wind power intelligent O&M
cost control. Through collation and rational analysis, the following four categories of
methodological systems are presented.
 Decision support system
The decision support system can help power companies prevent equipment failures
and damage by providing real-time equipment monitoring and maintenance information,
thereby reducing the number of repairs and the time needed to complete them and thus
lowering maintenance costs [ 113]. It can also integrate advanced intelligent optimization
algorithms, such as genetic algorithms and fuzzy cluster analysis, to optimize the processes
and parameters of wind power intelligent O&M, thereby reducing operating costs [ 114]. By
analyzing and visualizing the large amount of data generated during wind power intelligent
O&M, trends and anomalies can be identiÔ¨Åed to better understand the operational status
and conditions of the equipment, thereby improving operational efÔ¨Åciency and accuracy
and reducing maintenance costs [ 115]. By comprehensively controlling these aspects, the
decision support system can effectively reduce the cost of wind power intelligent O&M.

 maintenance to ensure equipment performance and reliability. These updates and mainte-
nance require a large amount of capital and human resources [111]. 
As shown in Figure 10, between 2018 and 2022, the number of wind turbines installed 
in China increased from 62,000 to 117,000, while the cost of wind power intelligent O&M 
increased from USD 14.7 billion to USD 20.1 billion. It can be predicted that the cost of 
wind power intelligent O&M will continue to rise in the next five years, suggesting an 
urgent need to control the cost of wind power intelligent O&M [112]. 
 
Figure 10. Installed wind tu rbine capacity and intelligent O&M costs in China, 2018 ‚Äì2022 [112]. 
As the cost of wind power intelligent O&M increases year by year, more and more 
scholars in the field are conducting in -depth research on wind power intelligent O&M 
cost control. Through collation and rational analysis, the following four categories of 
methodological systems are presented.  
‚Ä¢ Decision support system  
The decision support system can help power companies prevent equipment failures 
and damage by providing real -time equipm ent monitoring and maintenance information, 
thereby reducing the number of repairs and the time needed to complete them and thus 
lowering maintenance costs [113]. It can also integrate advanced intelligent optimization 
algorithms, such as genetic algorithm s and fuzzy cluster analysis, to optimize the pro-
cesses and parameters of wind power intelligent O&M, thereby reducing operating costs 
[114]. By analyzing and visualizing the large amount of data generated during wind 
power intelligent O&M, trends and anom alies can be identified to better understand the 
operational status and conditions of the equipment, thereby improving operational effi-
ciency and accuracy and reducing maintenance costs [115]. By comprehensively control-
ling these aspects, the decision supp ort system can effectively reduce the cost of wind 
power intelligent O&M.  
‚Ä¢ Fault warning and health management  
Fault warning and health management can detect the fault information of wind tur-
bines early on, leading to timely repair or replacement and thus i mproving the reliability 
and stability of the equipment [116]. It can also accurately determine the timeline and 
scope of equipment to be repaired and replaced, avoiding manual inspection and mainte-
nance time and thus reducing O&M costs. Through the analys is and prediction of 
Figure 10. Installed wind turbine capacity and intelligent O&M costs in China, 2018‚Äì2022 [112].
 Fault warning and health management
Fault warning and health management can detect the fault information of wind tur-
bines early on, leading to timely repair or replacement and thus improving the reliability
and stability of the equipment [ 116]. It can also accurately determine the timeline and scope
of equipment to be repaired and replaced, avoiding manual inspection and maintenance
time and thus reducing O&M costs. Through the analysis and prediction of equipment
operation data to develop a more accurate maintenance plan, timely monitoring and ad-
justment of equipment operation status can take place, reducing unnecessary maintenance
work and improving maintenance efÔ¨Åciency and quality [117].
 Life-Cycle Assessment
Life-cycle assessment is a method used to evaluate and, in turn, control the cost
of wind power intelligent O&M. First, in the planning stage, factors such as the use of
wind power, intelligent O&M, implementation factors, and environmental impact must
be considered to ensure the rationality and feasibility of the system. This assessment
also collects and analyzes a large amount of data from wind turbines to evaluate their
operational efÔ¨Åciency and economy over their life cycle [ 118]. Data collection and analysis
can be performed using tools such as sensors, monitoring equipment, and data analysis
software. Second, by evaluating the actual operation of the wind power intelligent O&M
system, the performance in terms of efÔ¨Åciency, cost, and sustainability over its life cycle
can be evaluated, summarized, and analyzed [ 119]. Third, by continuously improving
the system, its efÔ¨Åciency and economy can be improved, thus reducing costs. Fourth,
by decommissioning the system, the life cycle of wind power intelligent O&M can be
completed, and further maintenance and repair can be avoided [ 120]. The control of wind
power intelligent O&M costs through life-cycle assessment can effectively improve the
efÔ¨Åciency and economy of the system.
 Digital twin system
The digital twin system can quickly detect equipment faults, digitally determine the
cause of faults, and provide repair solutions and data support, which can reduce the time
and cost of manual inspection and equipment repair and can improve the automated
O&M of wind farms [ 121]. In addition, it can warn of wind farm failures, enable early
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

intervention of maintenance teams, and provide optimization recommendations through
simulation solutions to help wind farms improve power generation efÔ¨Åciency by reducing
troubleshooting time and costs, thereby balancing costs and beneÔ¨Åts [122].
In summary, intelligent O&M cost control is key to improving the economic beneÔ¨Åts
of wind power operation. Through scientiÔ¨Åc and reasonable O&M cost control, wind
farms can improve their proÔ¨Åts and increase their economic beneÔ¨Åts. Conducting wind
power intelligent O&M cost control can also ensure that staff pay more attention to the
operation status of wind power plants, Ô¨Ånding and correcting faults in a timely manner,
thus improving the operation efÔ¨Åciency of wind power plants. With the rapid development
of the wind power industry, the competition between enterprises is becoming more and
more intense. ScientiÔ¨Åc and reasonable control of wind power intelligent O&M costs can
reduce the cost of enterprise products and improve the competitiveness of enterprises.
4. Research on Key Technologies for Intelligent Operation and Maintenance of
Wind T urbines
The intelligent O&M of wind turbines is based on the integration of cloud computing
and big data to build a new energy intelligent platform for full data sharing and data value
deep mining. An online O&M solution based on a wind turbine condition assessment
model can improve station O&M capabilities and operational decision making [ 123‚Äì125].
It mainly focuses on preventive maintenance and optimization of spare part storage and
supply strategies. In order to improve the safety and reliability of wind turbines and
reduce O&M costs, it is essential to study the key technologies [ 126]. The development of
intelligent wind turbine O&M can be classiÔ¨Åed into several stages, as follows. The Ô¨Årst
stage is based on decision support systems. The second stage is centered on the fault
diagnosis model. The third stage involves the use of life-cycle assessment. In this section, a
summary of existing and potential key technologies is presented.

Many factors affect the choice of maintenance policy, such as failure probability and
weather conditions. It is unreasonable to expect O&M staff to take all these factors into
account when making decisions [ 127]. Hence, the emergence of decision support systems,
which can be used to provide decision makers with multiple and cost-effective options. The
decision support system (DSS) is an intelligence-based human‚Äìcomputer system that sup-

research, simulation, and behavioral science and uses computer technology, simulation, and
information technology as a means to address semi-structured decision-making problems.
The system is able to provide the decision maker with the necessary data and background
to help clarify the objectives of the decision, to carry out problem identiÔ¨Åcation, to build or
modify decision models, and to consider different alternatives [ 128]. Various options can
be evaluated and analyzed, compared, and judged through human‚Äìcomputer interaction
functions, providing the necessary support for correct decision making [129,130].

for low-voltage networks incorporating renewable energy sources (photovoltaic panels and
wind turbines), with the aim of achieving energy balance in pilot micro-grids, reducing
network energy consumption, and lowering operating costs. However, during operation,
the method only considers the qualitative beneÔ¨Åt of the energy provided by the micro-
grid subsystem, rather than the exact value provided by the government, which may
lead to small Ô¨Çuctuations in the experimental results. Rinaldi et al. [ 132] proposed a

Effective O&M aims to maximize economic efÔ¨Åciency. While tariffs are commonly
used to calculate the proÔ¨Åt or cost of electricity for wind farms, when they are used as
evaluation metrics in decision support models, they are mainly used to calculate the
production loss due to wind turbine downtime. Dinwoodie et al. [ 134] mentioned two
methods for calculating production losses. The basic approach is to use the product of the
rated power of the wind turbine as the capacity factor and downtime as the inÔ¨Çuencing
factor. Another more precise approach is to use a time series of wind speeds to create
a function and to determine the loss from this function curve. However, the literature
does not take into account the cost of employing staff and the replacement of parts for
wind turbines. Ju et al. [ 135] proposed a price-based demand‚Äìresponse virtual power
plant and constructed a risk-averse model based on a conditional value-at-risk approach
and robust optimization theory, considering the operational risks of wind power plants
and photovoltaic power generation. However, experimental data show that the system
is not suitable for simple scheduling scenarios where decision makers must fully account
for uncertainty in the factors and require improved prediction accuracy. Qin et al. [ 136]
proposed a new framework for wind farm resilience modeling to simulate how different
types of disturbances can lead to damage and failure of wind farm systems and subsystems,
as well as the associated direct and indirect consequences, to support optimization of asset
integrity management decisions. Relevant performance metrics for wind farms, such as
expected values for downtime and adequate inventory of essential spare parts, are easily
quantiÔ¨Åed within this framework. However, in terms of maintenance regime selection,
performing multiple condition substitutions to target different failure modes can achieve
expected production performance above current values. Benalcazar et al. [ 137] provided a
framework capable of identifying the optimal component size and determining the optimal
generation schedule for an autonomous hybrid energy system, based on the formulation
implementation of an optimization model with a linear programming approach and taking
into account the meteorological and economic parameters of the experimental area. The
techno-economic feasibility of hybrid energy system projects in remote areas of Ecuador
was addressed. The framework reduced investment costs more effectively than Qin‚Äôs
cost results. Although the difference between construction and production costs is not
signiÔ¨Åcant, Benalcazar‚Äôs model is clearly superior in terms of maintenance and recovery

Figure 12. Comparison of cost projections between two different models.
All decision support models should be able to integrate and evaluate different O&M
scenarios. Most decision support models operate in a complex environment, and op-
erators using the models must already have an in-depth understanding of how to use
them and be familiar with the reasons that affect their scheduling. There is currently no
operational model that optimizes maintenance policies without input from operators or
researchers. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a decision support model that can
be operated without the need to have experience in wind energy O&M. Over the past
decade, wind turbine decision support models have become a mature research Ô¨Åeld and
are gradually being applied to manage and operate the wind power industry. These mod-
els not only contribute to the sustainable development of the wind power industry but
also help wind power plant managers and operators to optimize the performance and
efÔ¨Åciency of wind turbines. Verhelst et al. [138] developed corrosion measurement data
visualization software that identiÔ¨Åes standards for effective structural corrosion analy-
sis as a scalable, SCADA-compatible, secure, and network-accessible tool, showing that
SCADA-compatible visualization software tools are possible and can signiÔ¨Åcantly reduce
the technical and experiential requirements for O&M service personnel. However, since
it is difÔ¨Åcult to quantify the corrosion process theoretically, both the quantity and quality
of data are extremely important, which also requires relevant organizations to raise risk
awareness and collect adequate data in a timely manner. Petrichenko et al. [ 139] established
a high-resolution methodology for measuring economic performance through a proposed
index under different development scenarios of renewable energy diffusion and different
network conÔ¨Ågurations by comparing the proÔ¨Åtability of two business models: individual
distributed consumption and energy communities; the latter proved to be a more proÔ¨Åtable
framework. However, the initial investment in energy communities is huge and requires
governments and investors to improve their decision-making capabilities. Din√ßer et al. [ 140]
developed a multi-criteria decision-making approach to evaluate energy technology in-
vestment options based on a multi-stage weighting ratio analysis to determine the relative

importance of factors and designed Ô¨Åve evaluation criteria: maintenance frequency, ease
of installation, environmental adaptability, transmission technology, and cost efÔ¨Åciency.
The results show that cost efÔ¨Åciency is the most important factor in the effectiveness of
energy investments and that investment decision makers should focus on this element.
However, there are no actual data to conÔ¨Årm the results obtained using this method, so
their applicability is questionable.
The maintenance and operation of wind turbines is costly and uncertain, and decision
support systems can assist O&M personnel in identifying, classifying, and predicting
failures or damage to wind turbines [ 141]. In the current technical research on decision
support systems, there are several problems.
 Data acquisition
Decision-support-system-based wind power intelligent O&M technology relies on the
accuracy and timeliness of equipment data, while current data collection and transmission
equipment has a relatively high failure rate and low data quality. Thus, more reliable data
collection and transmission equipment are needed to improve the accuracy and timeliness
of data.
 Data processing
Data derived from different devices, formats, and processing methods can vary, lead-
ing to quality, temporal, and processing efÔ¨Åciency issues. In addition, data processing
requires sufÔ¨Åcient computing power and storage capacity. Therefore, new technical means
for data processing and integration need to be explored. Among them, artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence
technology is currently the most promising means.
 Intelligent diagnosis
Machine learning is a common intelligent diagnostic technique used today. The
accuracy and reliability of this technique depends on the model. Therefore, models with
high accuracy need to be developed. Some new models, such as deep learning models and
decision tree models, are possible solutions to this problem.
 Maintenance forecasting
Maintenance prediction is an important element of decision-support-system-based
technology. Existing maintenance prediction methods are limited by historical data and
do not make good use of advanced algorithms and data from new energy monitoring
devices. These methods also do not use big data and have very limited accuracy in fault
prediction. The use of smarter algorithms, combined with big data means, can achieve
more convincing results.
In response to the above problems, several improvement methods can be proposed,
as follows. First, optimize data collection and transmission equipment to improve data
accuracy and timeliness. Second, apply artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence technology and data mining
technology to improve the quality and efÔ¨Åciency of data processing. Third, explore new
algorithm models, such as deep learning models and decision tree models, to improve
the accuracy of intelligent diagnosis. Fourth, use big data means to combine intelligent
algorithm models and machine learning methods for maintenance prediction to improve
the prediction effect. Meanwhile, multiple data sources can be combined to improve the ac-
curacy of fault prediction [ 142]. In conclusion, the research on wind power intelligent O&M
technology based on decision support systems needs to be improved to solve the existing
problems and to provide better technical support for efÔ¨Åcient and stable development of
the wind power industry.
4.2. Fault Diagnosis Models
Early detection and diagnosis of wind turbine failures is essential for the application
of possible maintenance and control strategies to avoid catastrophic events [ 143]. Never-
theless, turbines‚Äô complex and large-scale structures, as well as their operation in remote
locations with harsh environmental conditions and highly variable random loads, make
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

the occurrence of faults inevitable. Therefore, the use of algorithms that can continuously
monitor and diagnose potential faults and mitigate their effects before they become failures
can signiÔ¨Åcantly improve wind turbine fault mitigation [144].
In the study of wind energy bearing fault diagnosis models, Wang et al. [ 145] proposed
the instantaneous frequency selection strategy guided by the l-kurtosis Ô¨Çuctuation spectrum
(LFS) and the weight coefÔ¨Åcient determination strategy guided by the cuckoo search
algorithm (CSA) through the simulation of fault signals. It was veriÔ¨Åed that the optimized
adaptive chirp mode decomposition (OACMD) method has outstanding advantages in
defect detection in wind turbine bearings. However, this method is less efÔ¨Åcient and
cannot detect multiple sources of damage in wind turbine bearings under Ô¨Çuctuating speed
conditions. Guo et al. [ 146] used the KS method to study the temperature‚Äìpower dispersion
distribution of gears of similar units and convolutional neural networks to construct a
prediction model for bearing over temperature, which can detect abnormalities of the
turbine in advance and reÔ¨Çect the Ô¨Çuctuation of turbine parameters well; however, for
short-term fault warning, this approach needs to be remodeled based on historical data.
Zhao et al. [ 147] combined Gaussian kernel support vector machines with polynomial
kernel support vector machines and proposed a fault diagnosis method based on stochastic
subspace identiÔ¨Åcation (SSI) and multicore support vector machines (MSVMs) to accurately
identify wind turbine bearing faults. However, this method only tests for a single fault
signal and requires more in-depth analysis of the causes of multiple faults occurring
simultaneously. Gu et al. [ 148] proposed two models based on different principles: an
adaptive SR algorithm model based on quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) and
a wind energy bearing fault diagnosis model based on frequency information exchange
(FIE) combined with frequency conversion. However, these methods have a large data
bias in the frequency exchange process, and the experimental results are not accurate.
Liu et al. [ 149] validated a principle of testing for bearing temperature anomalies based
on space‚Äìtime fusion decisions. The principle uses the analytic hierarchy process (AHP)
entropy method to model the temperature rise in a bearing based on historical inspection
data uses the temperature signal to analyze the temperature characteristics of the bearing at
different time and space distributions. After comparing the actual temperature rise with the
predicted temperature rise, a diagnosis of the abnormalities in the bearing can be achieved.
This can reduce the false positive rate of diagnoses of abnormal temperature rises in the
bearing and has a strong early warning capability.
In the area of fault diagnosis models for wind energy gearboxes, Xu et al. [ 150] pro-
posed an improved hybrid attention module using a multi-scale convolutional neural
network as a feature learning model, in which a multi-label classiÔ¨Åer outputting single or
multiple labels was used to identify single or compound faults. The method was veriÔ¨Åed to
have higher accuracy and stability than other transmission compound fault diagnosis mod-
els for two transmission data sets; the diagnosis process is shown in Figure 13. However,
the method cannot be applied to early fault diagnosis. Mao et al. [ 151] effectively identiÔ¨Åed
structural and nonstructural defects by combining fused domain adaptive convolutional
neural networks (FDACNNs) with vibration signals and introducing adversarial networks
to achieve state identiÔ¨Åcation of structural and nonstructural defects in the unlabeled target
domain. Chen et al. [ 152] proposed an intelligent fault diagnosis model for wind energy
gear boxes, combining CNN and discrete wavelet transform. The deep training forward
pass rule is used to train a CNN with a deep hierarchical structure, constructed by alternat-
ing convolutional layers and subsampling layer by layer to transform the input low-level
features into high-level features. The parameters of the CNN are Ô¨Åne-tuned through a
back-propagation process to establish a mapping between the feature space and the fault
space. However, the system parameters and structural choices of the proposed model are
not discussed in detail, leading to insufÔ¨Åcient generality. Zhao et al. [ 153] developed a
variant of the deep residual network, namely, a dynamic weighted wavelet coefÔ¨Åcient, to
improve model diagnostic performance. Compared with CNN- and DRN-based methods,
the developed method improves the average training accuracy by 11.43% and 10.60% and
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Sustainability 2023 ,15, 8333 20 of 35
by 3.74% and 3.87%, respectively, in terms of test accuracy. However, this method is only
suitable for general data-driven fault diagnosis with small changes and cannot accurately
diagnose faults with large data Ô¨Çuctuations. Zhang et al. [ 154] proposed a hybrid improved
residual network-based wind turbine gearbox fault diagnosis method in conjunction with
the above research. The method implemented a wavelet transform on the initial signal,
highlighting the characteristics of the wavelet coefÔ¨Åcients. The proposed method was then
validated with a simulated data set from a drive train diagnostic simulator (DDS) and
actual measurement data from a wind farm. Compared with the literature [ 152‚Äì154], the
accuracy of the experimental results obtained using the HA-ResNet method under the DDS
simulated data was signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than that of other methods; the mean comparison
of the experimental results is shown in Table 3. However, the use of raw data for fault
diagnosis in the time domain is not recommended due to the time-shifted nature of raw
vibration signals.

 reasons behind it and proved that failures could be predicted in advance. However, due 
to flaws in the machine learning experimental setup, the experimental results over -relied 
on the reliability of the data set. Marti -Puig et al. [158] proposed a method of using a single 
hidden-layer feed -forward neural network (SLFN) to establish a wind turbine health sta-
tus monitoring and evaluation model, including using the remaining variables of the sys-
tem or subsystem to predict the target vari able, calculating the error deviation from the 
actual target variable, and finally comparing the high error value with the alarm event 
selection of the system. The performance of the model was validated. Table 4 compares 
the differences between the model s ignals selected by Leahy et al. and Marti -Puig et al. 
Although the latter selected fewer signals than the former, these signals show the operat-
ing environment of the wind turbine and can adequately represent the operating param-
eters during operation, thus greatly improving the credibility of condition monitoring. 
Though it is robust to mislabeled data that may be introduced during the training phase, 
fault locations cannot be accurately predicted.

In terms of overall fault diagnosis models for wind turbines, most scholars use the
SCADA data set as a modeling reference. Liu et al. [ 155] developed an ambient temperature
regression prediction model for wind turbine components using the limiting gradient
boosting algorithm, which can be used to calculate the residuals between the predicted and
actual values. The exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) control chart principle
was used to monitor the variation trend of the residual difference. However, wind turbines
are typically nonlinear multi-coupled systems, where the relationships between different
faults are complex and the coupling is strong, so that the entire fault of a wind turbine
cannot be accurately predicted. Watson et al. [ 156] used existing Supervisory Control
and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data collected for a brand new wind turbine to model
operational behavior and to construct a Markov space to be used as a reference space. The
fault diagnosis of a wind turbine was performed by comparing the wind turbine behavior
predicted by the trained model with the reference space and analyzing the distribution
and correlation of the wind turbine SCADA data. However, the fault model was combined
with the acoustic signal, which reduced the success rate of fault detection. Leahy et al. [ 157]
established an accurate training database by automatically identifying historical wind
turbine alarm sequences and using rule sets to infer wind turbine downtime and the
reasons behind it and proved that failures could be predicted in advance. However, due to
Ô¨Çaws in the machine learning experimental setup, the experimental results over-relied on
the reliability of the data set. Marti-Puig et al. [ 158] proposed a method of using a single
hidden-layer feed-forward neural network (SLFN) to establish a wind turbine health status
monitoring and evaluation model, including using the remaining variables of the system
or subsystem to predict the target variable, calculating the error deviation from the actual
target variable, and Ô¨Ånally comparing the high error value with the alarm event selection of
the system. The performance of the model was validated. Table 4 compares the differences
between the model signals selected by Leahy et al. and Marti-Puig et al. Although the latter
selected fewer signals than the former, these signals show the operating environment of
the wind turbine and can adequately represent the operating parameters during operation,
thus greatly improving the credibility of condition monitoring. Though it is robust to
mislabeled data that may be introduced during the training phase, fault locations cannot
be accurately predicted.

Fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control schemes for wind turbines are critical to
their reliability, availability, and cost-effectiveness. However, there remain problems in the
current research. For example, the existing fault diagnosis models are mostly based on
experience or rules and cannot accommodate adaptive learning and or accurately diagnose
newly appearing faults. In addition, there are many kinds of wind power equipment, and
various types of faults continually appear, which requires a large amount of data support
and complex algorithms to build fault diagnosis models. The fault diagnosis process must
involve the comprehensive analysis of many factors, including the structure and operation

status of the wind turbine itself, the wind resource situation, and the qualiÔ¨Åcations of the
O&M personnel.
Therefore, more machine learning algorithms should be used to learn historical data
to improve the accuracy and adaptability of the model, to carry out large-scale and multi-
dimensional data collection, to effectively analyze and process data to explore potential
correlations in order to improve the prediction accuracy of the model, and to adopt open
data to improve the sharing and accessibility of data and open data channels for various
application scenarios.
4.3. Life-Cycle Costs
The life cycle of a wind energy project can be subdivided into economic life cycle,
construction life cycle, and natural life cycle. The economic service life is deÔ¨Åned as the
service life with the lowest average cost. The design life is the period of time that a wind
farm is designed to be used effectively, without loss of use. Natural life is the actual time a
wind farm is in use under natural operation [ 159]. Life-cycle analysis methods are proposed
and widely used in the feasibility analysis of wind energy projects to reÔ¨Çect the details
of the entire life-cycle process of a product. Researchers have analyzed the economics of
wind energy and provided a series of literature reviews. These reviews provide a positive
reference for cost modelling, revenue analysis, and structural optimization at various stages
of wind energy development and implementation [160].
With regard to the life-cycle components of wind energy projects, the main components
are the planning and design stage, the construction stage, the O&M stage, and the closure
stage. Figure 14 shows the workÔ¨Çow for the planning and design phase of a wind energy
project. The main tasks of the planning and design phase include wind resource assessment,
site selection and land planning, investment and Ô¨Ånancing, engineering feasibility studies,
and environmental impact assessments [ 161,162]. By 2020, the global average unit capacity
of new wind turbines had increased to more than 2.5 MW onshore, and the annual aggregate
unit capacity of new wind turbines had increased to more than 7 MW offshore [ 163,164].
Once the preliminary design is completed, researchers carry out a feasibility analysis of
the project, which includes an analysis of the need for the project to be built, a physical
feasibility analysis, and an economic analysis. Finally, project and pre-production activities
are carried out with regard to ecological restoration, project assurance, base reserves, and
pre-production. Major tasks in the construction phase are to organize and plan construction,
to construct civil bases, to erect pylons, to install electrical and control systems, and to
simulate operation and commissioning [ 165]. The process of operating and maintaining
a wind farm throughout its life cycle is referred to as the O&M phase. Rationalizing
production, managing equipment, carrying out O&M, and ensuring the generation and
stable operation of the wind farm are the main tasks in this phase [ 166]. For wind farms, the
O&M phase is a long cycle with a large number of uncertainties, and the costs corresponding
to this phase include the costs of O&M and the costs of land lease [ 167]. Currently, wind
farm operations and maintenance are carried out jointly by wind turbine manufacturers
and operators. The closure phase may include preparation for closure, disassembly of
equipment, cleaning and recycling of the site, disposal of recyclable waste, and approval of
the works. Most life-cycle analyses only consider full decommissioning, including complete
dismantling and site clearance. Figure 15 shows the decomposition structure of the wind
farm decommissioning work [168].

of assumed capacity factors. They also used the Conditional Maximum Likelihood impact 
assessment methodology to assess 11 environmental impact categories. The results 
showed that most of the impacts were attributed to support infrastructure. However, since 
environmental performance is very sensitive to variations in capacity factors, the im-
portance of wind project siting should be emphasized. Typically, NPV (net present value),

 the generation and stable operation of the wind farm are the  main tasks in this phase [166]. 
For wind farms, the O&M phase is a long cycle with a large number of uncertainties, and 
the costs corresponding to this phase include the costs of O&M and the costs of land lease 
[167]. Currently, wind farm operations and m aintenance are carried out jointly by wind 
turbine manufacturers and operators. The closure phase may include preparation for clo-
sure, disassembly of equipment, cleaning and recycling of the site, disposal of recyclable 
waste, and approval of the works. Mo st life-cycle analyses only consider full decommis-
sioning, including complete dismantling and site clearance. Figure 15 shows the decom-

processes to the life-cycle process to reduce their environmental impact. However, this

used AHP to assess the life-cycle risk of distributed wind plants, providing a perspective on
future research directions for distributed wind. However, the AHP is too simplistic for the
current evaluation method, and another, more accurate method may be used to assess the
risk impact. To facilitate comparison with other studies, Kouloumpis et al. [ 172] conducted

and NAV (net annual value) are widely used in the process of selecting indicators to
evaluate wind energy [ 161]. These indicators reÔ¨Çect the viability of the different directions
of project investment and are commonly used for the economic assessment of wind energy
projects [ 173]. PVC and ROI are indicators of absolute value. They can only represent the
cash value of a given amount of investment over a given period of time. The difference
between investment and generation capacity can be reÔ¨Çected by other relevant indicators,
such as LOCE, IRR, PBP , and NPV [ 174]. PBP increases project risk by allocating the
investment over the payback period and does not take into account post-payback cash
Ô¨Çows. NPV , PBP , PVC, ROI, and IRR are difÔ¨Åcult to use to benchmark different regions,
types, and levels of technology, and it is challenging to forecast the cash Ô¨Çows under Ô¨Çexible
policies [ 175]. By comparison, LCOE removes the limitations of various regions, types,
and sizes for studying the investment merits of a project, allowing for further analysis of
the main factors affecting the cost of electricity generation, as well as accurate horizontal
comparisons and choices between diverse projects [ 176]. The LCOE has become a common
economic indicator to assess the overall competitiveness of wind energy projects. In
addition, the economic analysis of certain types of projects often uses a more inclusive
valuation approach, which combines PBP , IRR, and NPV [177].
In the Ô¨Åeld of life-cycle cost modelling for wind energy projects, there are many un-
certainties in the economic analysis process, leading to a large gap in the results of the
analysis and the actual cost of the project. Therefore, scientists have proposed various
approaches to uncertainty analysis and prediction algorithms to quantify impacts and
to estimate uncertainty factors. Tsvetkova et al. [ 178] classiÔ¨Åed the sensitivity analysis
output variables, methods, applications, and software, highlighting the problems with this
type of analysis. Currently applied computational models are expensive, and an effective

sensitivity computational model is urgently needed in the Ô¨Åeld. Leite et al. [ 179] suggested
that energy prices, production capacity factors, and capital operating costs are the most
critical variables affecting economic viability. They used a global sensitivity model to
identify the most sensitive parameters affecting the results of economic analysis; however,
the model did not establish the corresponding life-cycle model according to the key vari-
ables. An et al. [180] designed and discussed a four-level life-cycle evaluation platform
for wind turbines based on IoT architecture, developed a model based on IMPACT 2002+,
and selected energy recovery time as an important evaluation index for wind turbines; the
evaluation model is shown in Figure 16. The platform is oriented toward wind turbines,
with good scalability and credibility. However, no reasonable and effective tests have been
conducted to obtain valid experimental data. Yuan et al. [181] improved the LCOE model
as a life-cycle costing method in three ways. They considered the quantiÔ¨Åcation of external
costs, expanded the composition of internal costs, and discounted electricity generation
to provide a quantitative reference for electricity production and consumption decisions.
However, the method is only applicable to the general domestic environment in China
and has not been tested in other countries and thus is not universally applicable [ 182].
Erfani et al. [ 183] proposed a risk assessment model for wind energy investment projects,
considering expert knowledge and background, based on the risk analysis of improved
fuzzy group decision making. The authors established a comprehensive model of risk
assessment and cost estimation on this basis, proving that the risk management process
has a great impact on investment proÔ¨Åtability. However, all cash Ô¨Çow parameters in this
model are modeled using the triangle assumption, and the interplay and correlation risk
among cash Ô¨Çow parameters is not investigated. Liu et al. [ 184] developed a new algorithm,
called the Cuckoo Search Algorithm with Steepest Descent, based on the improved cuckoo
search algorithm and optimizing the weights; it showed higher accuracy and stability in
predicting wind speed. However, this method is not sufÔ¨Åciently accurate to predict the
upper limit of the wind farm alarm threshold in practical applications. Based on a long
short-term memory (LSTM) network and a gray wolf optimizer (GWO) disaggregation
technique, Altan et al. [ 185] developed a new hybrid WSF (Wind Speed Forecasting) model.
The model was able to accurately reÔ¨Çect the nonlinear properties of the WSTS (wind speed
time series). However, it is more cumbersome and less accurate in its predictions. A new
and different hybrid wind speed prediction system based on the combination of two model
frameworks, linear and nonlinear, was proposed by Huang et al. [ 186]. It included the
use of linear ARMA (auto regressive and moving average) to catch the underlying linear
mode in the data, as well as CS-optimized BPNN (back propagation neural networks) to
catch the underlying nonlinear mode in the data. However, other linear and nonlinear
models were not considered in the study. Ma et al. [ 187] combined hierarchical analysis,
network analysis, and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation methods to establish a hybrid
hierarchical structure model and combined this with a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation
method to determine the Ô¨Ånal risk level. The model fully considered the inÔ¨Çuence of
various disaster factors and was more scientiÔ¨Åc and accurate than the previous evaluation
methods. However, the model used the AHP-fuzzy method, which is too simplistic and less
convincing under the depth of current research. Dai et al. [ 188] proposed a self-attentive
neural network (SANN) model based on attention for online learning, which could capture
temporal relationships more efÔ¨Åciently with a customized attention module; this online
learning algorithm could adapt to weather, operational, and environmental changes to
improve prediction accuracy. The SANN model is more cost effective than existing models.
A comparison of the results between different models is shown in Table 5.

tems with data centers (DC-RIEHS) considering wind power uncertainty and using afÔ¨Åne

modeling of individual data centers and the Ô¨Çexible planning of energy systems in their
surrounding areas, without considering detailed energy networks. Alshamrani et al. [198]
proposed a transmission expansion planning model that considers the voltage stability
assessment of a grid with embedded wind farms under uncertainty conditions, which is
unique in that it incorporates the voltage stability margin (VSM) into the planning model.
The model is a two-tier model in which the Ô¨Årst tier minimizes the total investment and
operating cost minus the weighted VSM and the second tier evaluates the optimal expan-

sion plan given by the VSM from the Ô¨Årst tier. However, the model is run without the
inclusion of transmission line conductors, which can increase the desired loading factor.
Maienza et al. [199] collected the latest data and parametric equations from databases and
literature to establish a life-cycle cost model for offshore Ô¨Çoating wind farms, divided the
life-cycle cost into three parts‚Äîcapital cost, O&M cost, and decommissioning cost‚Äîand
analyzed the differences between different types of Ô¨Çoating platforms in terms of cost com-
ponents, transportation, and installation. Garcia-Teruel et al. [ 200] performed a life-cycle
assessment of an offshore Ô¨Çoating wind farm using an advanced O&M model to quantify
the impact of environmental factors and compared the estimated characteristics of the
Spar case and the Semi-sub case, as shown in Table 6. The data prove the viability and
practicality of the proposed model.

With the continuous development and application of intelligent technologies, research
on intelligent O&M technologies for wind power based on life-cycle costs has also seen
some progress [ 203,204]. This section provides an overview of the progress of life-cycle
cost-based research.
First, there is a lack of life-cycle cost considerations. Many studies on wind power in-
telligent O&M technologies do not consider the full life-cycle costs of wind farms, focusing
only on a single O&M cost or equipment maintenance cost. This one-sided considera-
tion can lead to excessive reductions in O&M costs, while causing higher losses in later
operations and maintenance. Second, there are insufÔ¨Åcient data processing and analysis ca-
pabilities. Wind power intelligent O&M technology requires the processing and analysis of
a large amount of data; however, most wind farms remain weak in this area, and thus, data
processing and analysis capabilities need to be further improved. This can lead to a decline
in O&M efÔ¨Åciency, which affects the safety and reliability of wind farms. Third, there is a
lack of an efÔ¨Åcient collaborative O&M mechanism. There is a large amount of O&M work
in wind farms; this requires cooperation among multiple O&M teams. However, there is
a lack of efÔ¨Åcient collaborative O&M mechanisms, which leads to poor cooperation and
information asymmetry in the O&M process, which reduces efÔ¨Åciency.
For the above problems, the following countermeasures are suggested.
1. Establishing a sound and universal whole life cost model requires in-depth research
and discussion for different application scenarios. By quantifying the costs and
beneÔ¨Åts of wind farms at different stages, a reasonable optimization of the economic
beneÔ¨Åts of the whole wind farm can be achieved [205].
2. It is necessary to strengthen data management and analysis capabilities by adopting ef-
Ô¨Åcient data mining and analysis algorithms, as well as more scientiÔ¨Åc, reasonable, and
effective cost estimation methods; this will lead to fast and accurate data processing
and will improve cost estimation capabilities.
3. It is essential to establish an efÔ¨Åcient, collaborative O&M mechanism; to strengthen
the training and communication of O&M personnel; and to improve the cooperation
between O&M teams, so as to achieve more efÔ¨Åcient intelligent O&M for wind power.

5. Summary and Conclusions
In this paper, the common failure modes and causes of wind turbines are discussed
in detail, and the failure mechanisms and processes of wind turbine equipment are inves-
tigated. This study analyzes current O&M costs in the wind energy industry so that the
reader can understand the relationship between wind energy operations and maintenance
costs. Finally, we review the current research results on key technologies for intelligent
O&M in the wind energy industry, summarize the problems that exist in these research
results, and provide an outlook on the future directions of intelligent O&M in the wind
energy industry. According to the review of previous studies, a great deal of experimental
and theoretical research is still needed in the following areas.
(a) Fault analysis and research of wind turbine
 Failure data comes from different platforms and systems, and the differences in data
quality lead to certain problems in data stability and reliability. Data quality should
be improved by methods such as standardizing defective data and creating a defect
database to provide a basis for subsequent data analysis.
 Not only do wind turbines have a large number of installations and complex oper-
ational data, but the number of effective analyses for fault samples is small, which
results in a lack of real and valid fault analysis data. By establishing a multi-domain
fault data platform and providing more fault samples to accelerate the training efÔ¨Å-
ciency of these machine learning algorithms, the accuracy of fault analysis results can
be improved.
 The current fault analysis algorithms are based mainly on machine learning algorithms.
However, while they have high accuracy, some of the algorithms have low processing
efÔ¨Åciency, and it is difÔ¨Åcult to address large-scale fault analysis problems. In order to
develop more efÔ¨Åcient and faster Java application systems for fault analysis decision
support, new types of algorithms, such as deep-learning-based algorithms, should be
actively practiced and developed.
 Fault diagnosis requires a large amount of domain knowledge and experience. How-
ever, in the actual fault analysis process, the analysis of the real situation is sometimes
limited by the accumulation of knowledge. A Ô¨Åne-tuned fault knowledge system and
modeling method should be established to correlate the wind turbine operational state
with the fault mode to achieve accurate and fast fault diagnosis and evaluation.
(b) Research on key technologies of wind energy intelligent O&M
 Wind turbines produce a variety of data during operation, and the data are numer-
ous, scattered, and discontinuous; thus, a reÔ¨Åned data acquisition system must be
established to integrate the data into an analyzable format. A fast and efÔ¨Åcient data
acquisition system should be established to integrate discrete and scattered data
into an analyzable format to provide a basis for wind turbine condition monitoring
and prediction.
 Data analysis algorithms and models suitable for wind turbines need to be established,
and based on these algorithms and models, intelligent diagnosis and early warning
systems need to be developed to diagnose and prevent wind turbine failures in a
timely and accurate manner.
 A large amount of data and analysis results must be accurately and reliably trans-
formed into effective decision support to realize automated operation and intelligent
decision making. A reliable and practical intelligent decision support system should be
established to deeply analyze the meaning behind the data and to provide intelligent
decision support.
 The intelligent O&M system undoubtedly faces hidden security problems, such as
system attacks and data leakage, which seriously affect the safe and stable operation
of wind turbines. Strict measures such as data encryption, system security prevention,
and vulnerability repair should be taken to improve the security and conÔ¨Ådentiality of
the wind power intelligent O&M system.
