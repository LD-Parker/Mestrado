Abstract—Unscheduled maintenance consumes a lot of time 
and effort  and hence reduces the overall cost -effectiveness of wind 
turbines. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) 
based condition monitoring is a cost -effective approach to carry 
out diagnosis  and prognosis of faults and to provide performance  
assessment of  a wind turbine. The rotor speed based power curve, 
which describes the nonlinear relationship between wind turbine 
rotor speed and power output, is useful for performance appraisal 
of a wind turbine though limited work on this area has been 
undertaken  to date. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a data -
driven, nonparametric approach used for both classification and 
regression problems developed initially from statistical learning 
theory (SLT) by Vapnik. SVM is useful in forecasting and 
prediction applications.   
This paper deals with the application of support vector 
regression to estimate the rotor speed based power curve of a wind 
turbine and its usefulness in identifying potential faults. It is 
compared  with a conventional approach based on a binned rotor 
speed power curve to identify operational anomalies. The 
comparative studies summarise the advantages and disadvantages 
of these techniques. SCADA data obtained from a healthy 
operational wind turbine is used to train and validate these 
methods.  
Keywords —anomaly detection, condition monitoring, support 
vector machine, nonparametric models, wind turbine.  
I. INTRODUCTION  
Wind energy is a source of clean energy that shows a steady 
growth worldwide, for example, as pe r GWEC 2016 report [1], 
the total world installed capacity by the wind industry has 
changed from 1.29  GW in 1995 to 370  GW by the end of 2015 . 
Such  impressive growth increases the need to minimi ze the Cost 
of Energy (COE) of wind turbines. Operation and ma intenance 
(O&M) costs represent a significant portion of the total annual costs of a wind turbine  and are higher for offshore  wind turbines 
as compared to onshore wind turbines [2]. There  is potential to 
improve the profitability of offshore wind by developing 
condition based maintenance.   
SCADA based condition monitoring is a cost -effective 
approach that helps to ensure the security, reliability , and 
stability of wind turbines while in op eration [3]. Continuous 
monitoring  of the condition of wind turbines is a most effective 
way to reduce the O&M cost and prevent the fault from  reaching 
a catastrophic stage through early detection  [4,5]. Several  
techniques have been proposed to achieve thi s, and are described  
as follows.  
Power curves are nonlinear relationships  that define  the 
relationship between power output and hub wind speeds and are 
widely used to analy ze the operational health of a wind turbine 
using SCADA data sets. The International Standard IEC 61400 -
12-1, [6] outline s the guidelines for modeling  an effective  power 
curve using the ‘method  of bins’ which is helpful for condition 
monitoring and measuring  power performance characteristics 
though it is slow to respond and is not entirely accurate [6,7]. It 
is not always possible to analy ze the performance of a wind 
turbine using a power curve. Other performance indicators such 
as rotor speed, blade pitch an gle are also vital for active 
condition monitoring [8]. For example, Singh [9], used power 
and rotor speed curve s to identify abnormal  operation. The 
comparative studies of these two curves concluded that the rotor 
speed curve identified a performance chan ge due to downtime 
event, but when reviewing its corresponding power curve, this 
performance change cannot be identified . Thus, it is desirable to 
consider other  key performance indicator s for active  wind 
turbine condition monitoring [8,9].  
Parametric and  nonparametric approach es are widely used  
for data-driven models for wind turbine condition monitoring 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
[10,11]. Nonparametric models do not impose any pre -specified 
condition unlike parametric approach es and  hence are best 
suited for describing the operational behavior  of wind turbines. 
Artificial neural network s (ANNs) [12], Gaussian Process (GP) 
[13], kNN  [14], support vector machine (SVM) [15] and 
Random forest [16] are the widely used nonparametric 
approach es for wind tu rbine condition monitoring purposes . 
Most of the nonparametric models used the power curve as a key 
performance indicator to assess the power performance of a 
wind turbine, see [11,17,18].  
Support vector machine (SVM) is powerful data -driven, 
machine learn ing approach popularly used for classification and 
regression related problem s first discovered by Vladimir Vapnik 
and his colleagues in 1992 [19]. SVM regression entirely relies 
on a kernel function ; it is a nonparametric approach widely used 
in the wind turbine condition monitoring [20,21].  
Studies to date have mostly focused on the power curve to 
assess turbine performance though it cannot alone describe the 
operational behavior  of turbines because internal factors 
profoundly influence the turbine perfor mance .  Hence other key 
performance indicators are necessary for valid power 
performance assessments of a wind turbine. In this study, rotor 
speed curves that reveal the nonlinear relationship between rotor 
speed and power output  are investigated .  
In this  paper, a novel support vector regression (SVR) 
approach for wind turbine rotor speed curve modeling  and its 
application in anomaly detection for condition monitoring is 
proposed . The binning method is the benchmark for wind 
industries, but its application  is limited to power curve only. It 
can be extended  to calculate the rotor speed curve. This is then 
compared  with SVR based rotor speed curve , and the advantages 
and limitations of these techniques  are assessed . 
This paper  is outlined  as follows: Section 1 is the 
introduction. Section 2 describes the wind turbine rotor speed 
curve modeling  and air density correction. Section 3 provides 
the SCADA dataset description , and the pre-processing 
techniques  applied . Section 4 describes the met hodologies of 
support vector regression and binning. Section 5 described the 
comparative analysis of SVR and binning methods and Section 
6 concludes th e paper.  
II. WIND TURBINE ROTOR CURVES  
Rotor speed is one of the key performance indicators (KPIs) 
used to de scribe the critical relationship between power 
production and hub height wind speed. The nonlinear 
relationship between power output and rotor speed is called rotor 
speed power curve and is shown  in figure 1. Another, rotor speed 
curve is defined as the relationship between rotor speed and 
wind speed (figure 2) where rotor speed increases with the 
increase of wind speed above  cut-in wind speed [ 9]. Both rotor 
curves are useful for performance assessment and fault 
diagnosis purposes [8].

III. DATA DESCRIPTIONS  
The SCADA data used in this study are from pitch controlled 
variable speed wind turbines located in Scotland, UK that comes 
with 10 min sampling interval resolution and contains more than 
100 different signals ranging from timestamp, calculated values, 
set point, measurements of temperature, current, voltage, wind 
speed, power output, wind direction and so on .  A full year of 
data starting from January  2012 to December  2012  is available . 
The SCADA data records the significant information such as 
operational and load history without any extra cost. Hence 
SCADA based condition monitoring is considered a cost -
effective approach. However, data obtained from the SCADA 
system is not error  free due to sensor failures and data 
malfunctions. To make sure that the SVR model accuracy is not 
affected by these errors initial data screening and filtering 
process needed. The criterion described in [22] including  
timestamp mismatches, out of  range values, negative power 
values, and turbine power curtailment s are applied  to remove 
confusing and potentially misleading data.  
The data used in this study is from  a 2.3 MW Siemens 
turbine and records 4464 data points beginning with time stamp 
‘‘1/7/ 2012 00:00 AM’’ and ending at time stamp ‘‘31/7/2012 
23:50 PM’’ .  Rotor scatter s plots  based on  these data are shown  
in figures 1 and 2. These measured data points became 626 data 
points after pre -processing (table 1) and w ere used to model the 
rotor curve s using SVR and binning methods in the next 
sections. The pre -processed and air density corrected rotor 
curves  are shown  in figure 4 and 5.

IEC 61400 -12-1 [6], outlines the guidelines for an individual 
wind turbine. Since SCADA data used in this study are from 
pitch regulated wind turbines, so as per IEC standard, air density 
correction should be applied using the following equations  
                    ρ=1.225  [288 .15

where, 𝑉𝐶 and 𝑉𝑀 are the corrected and measured wind speed in 
m/sec and the corrected air density is calculated by equation (1) 
where B is atmospheric pressure in mbar and T the temperature 
in Kelvin. The air density is affected  by various factors such as 
locatio n, altitude and ambient temperature. In equation (2), B 
and T records 10 -minute average values obtained from SCADA 
datasets of an operational wind turbine. The calculated value of 
ρ then being used in equation (2) to calculate the corrected wind 
speed ( 𝑉𝐶 ) . This corrected wind speed is used for constructing 
rotor curves in upcoming sections.

The two methods are proposed for rotor power curve 
estimation and are de scribed as fo llows,  
Support Vector Machine  based  Rotor Power Curve  
A systematic and detailed explanation of Support Vector 
Machine (SVM) can be found in Re f. [19] and for more details 
see [15,20 -21]. Because of SVM dependency on kernels, it is a 
nonparamet ric model and is useful  in finding  complex and 
nonlinear relationship s between a high number of parameters.  
SVM is a particular class of algorithms widely used in 
classification and regression problems that are identified by the 
utilis ation of ke rnels , absence of local minima, sparseness of the 
solution and capacity control obtained by acting on the margin, 
or on a numb er of suppo rt vectors [19].  Here we only provide a 
brief description of SVR technique for rotor curve modelling.  
A Lagrangian function o f the primal function calculated by 
inserting nonnegative multipliers 𝛼𝑛 and 𝛼𝑛∗ for calculating dual 
SVR formula (dual SVR formula perform faster than standard 
hence used in this study [23]) where the inner product of 
predictors 𝑎𝑖′𝑎𝑗 is changed b y its corresponding element from 
the Gram matrix 𝑡𝑖𝑗 for accurate support vector regression 
modeling. The Gram matrix is an n -by-n matrix that 
incorporates elements; 𝑡𝑖𝑗=𝑇(𝑎𝑖,𝑎𝑗),where 𝑎𝑖,𝑎𝑗 are th e pre -
processed SCADA data points used for tra ining, see section 3 . 
Since SVM were first introduced with hard margin formulation 
[19], for which Lagrange dual formulation (because of the 
constraints) seems more natural for nonlinear systems [24]. 
Using this method, a nonlinear SVR calculates the opti mal 
function f(a) in the transformed predictor space where SVR 
search for the coefficient that minimize the Lagrangian function 
using dual formula [19,25],  
𝐿(𝛼)=0.5∑ ∑ (𝛼𝑖−𝛼𝑖∗)(𝛼𝑗−𝛼𝑗∗)𝑁
𝑗=1𝑁
𝑖=1 𝑇(𝑎𝑖,𝑎𝑗)+
 𝜀∑ (𝛼𝑖+𝛼𝑖∗)𝑁
𝑖=1 −∑ 𝑦𝑖(𝛼𝑖−𝛼𝑖∗)𝑁
𝑖=1                        (3) 
under the following conditions,  
∑ (𝛼𝑛−𝛼𝑛∗)𝑁
𝑛=1 =0 ;                  
∀𝑛∶0≤𝛼𝑛≤𝐶 ; 
∀𝑛∶0≤𝛼𝑛∗≤𝐶. 
The function 𝑓(𝑎) used to fit the SVR model for rotor curves 
is given by:  
   𝑓(𝑎)=∑ (𝛼𝑛−𝛼𝑛∗)𝑁
𝑛=1 𝑇(𝑥𝑛,𝑥)+𝑏               (4) 
This specific SVR called 𝜀- SVR and ε -insensitive loss 
function is used to build the objective function of the 𝜀- SVR.  
The Karush -Kuhn -Tucker (KKT) conditions are significant 
in dealing with constrained optimi zation  and using KKT 
conditions [26] of quad ratic programming, a limited number of 
the coefficients (𝛼𝑛−𝛼𝑛∗) will assume nonzero values.  The 
data points associated with nonzero coefficients having 
approximation errors equal to or larger than 𝜀 , are referred to as 
support vectors while the sampl es fall outside the  𝜀 –insensitive 
zone are not considered as support vectors and play no role in 
estimation. The KKT complementarity conditions are 
optimization constraints required to obtain optimal solutions and

for nonlinear SVM regression, these cond itions are defined as 
follows,  
∀𝑛∶ 𝛼𝑛(𝜀+𝜉𝑛−𝑦𝑛+𝑓(𝑎𝑛))=0  ; 
∀𝑛∶ 𝛼𝑛(𝜀+𝜉𝑛∗+𝑦𝑛−𝑓(𝑎𝑛))=0 ; 
∀𝑛∶ 𝜉𝑛(𝐶−𝛼𝑛)=0 ; 
∀𝑛∶ 𝜉𝑛∗(𝐶−𝛼𝑛∗)=0 ; 
The trade -off between the model complexity (flatness) and 
the degree to which larger deviations are tolerated  in the 
optimi zation  formulation is calculated by 𝐶 [19] whereas 𝜀 
manage s the width of the  𝜀 -insensitive zone and is useful to 
train the data points  and thus  affect s the number of support 
vectors. In summary, both  C and 𝜀 -values affect SVR 
performance and, hence, it is important  to calculate the optimal 
values for these parameters by using appropriate optimisation 
techniques. In addition, cross -validation folds (5 folds  here) are  
used to prevent overfitting and an effect ive grid search [25,26]. 
The pre -processed data points (see section 3) were randomly 
shuffled and divided into training and testing data sets, for 
training and SVR model validation purposes. The Gaussian 
kernel or radial basis function (RBF) kernel is used to form 
qualified function and is mathematically defined as,  
               𝑘(𝑎,𝑎′)=𝑒𝑥𝑝(−𝛾‖𝑎−𝑎′‖2)                  (5) 
where 𝛾 is the kernel scale for a given points 𝑎 and 𝑎′.   
Using above describe d SVR theory, a rotor power curve s is 
constructe d and then compared with a measured rotor curve, see 
figure 5. Figure 5 suggest s that the SVR based rotor power curve 
closely follow s the measured curve. The SVR model suffers 
when  dealing with massive  numbers  of data points due to cube 
inverse issue, see [24], so appropriately limiting the size of data 
sets is important  for accurate SVR modeling .

Fig 6: measured & estimated power in time series  
SVR is  non –parametric in nature , and hence residual analysis is 
essential. Residuals are defined as the difference between 
measured value and estimated values and are shown  in figure 7.  
The frequency distribution of the residuals is shown in figure 8 
together with a fitted Gaussian distribut ion; it is found  that the 
distribution of residuals closely follow s a Gaussian distribution.

Binned based Rotor Power Curve  
The IEC 61400 -12 proposed data reduction technique to 
calculate the power curve of a wind turbine is called ‘binning .’ 
The binning technique consist s of grouping output power 
measurements into wind speed bins so that average output power 
obtained for each bin. The bin width is 0.5 m/sec . Adding more 
data points give s more certainty to the  average value. It is worth 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
noting that wind speed is the most significant source of 
uncertainty in power performance assessment and methods such 
as meteorological Mast (IEC 61400 -12-1 (2005), Ground -based 
LiDAR / SoDAR (IEC 61400 -12-1), Nacelle -mounted LiDAR, 
Nacelle -mounted anemometry (EC 61400 -12-2 (2013)) and 
Existing nacelle -mounted anemometry (SCADA) are 
commonly used to measure wind speed for performance 
assessment [7].  Here, the binning method is applied to calculate 
rotor power curve using following equations,  
𝑉𝑟𝑖=1
 𝑁𝑖∑𝑉𝑟𝑛,𝑖,𝑗𝑁𝑖
𝑗=1 
𝑃𝑖=1
 𝑁𝑖∑𝑃𝑛,𝑖,𝑗𝑁𝑖
𝑗=1 
where, 𝑉𝑟𝑖 =  normalised and averaged rotor speed in bin 𝑖; 
            𝑉𝑟𝑛,𝑖,𝑗 =  normalised rotor speed of data set s 𝑗 in bin  𝑖. 
     𝑃𝑖 =  normalised and averaged power in bin 𝑖 ; 
    𝑃𝑛,𝑖,𝑗 =  normalised power of data set 𝑗 in bin  𝑖. 
   𝑁𝑖 = number of 10 min average data sets in bin  𝑖. 
Using binning , a rotor power curve constructed together with 
error bars is compared  with a measured rotor power curve in  
figure 9. Two standard deviation s (i.e., 95% confidence 
intervals) of measured power values are used to calculate the 
error bars which reflect  the uncer tainty associated with each bin 
of the rotor power curve. However, the binning method accuracy 
is compromised  by choosing the bin width of 0.5 m/sec because 
within each bin the measured power will depend strongly and 
non-linearly on wind speed ;  a wide  bin would result in a 
systematic bias, and the re is need in practice to get sufficient 
data points in each bin to be of statistical significance [26].

V. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS  
 In this section, a compa rative analysis of binned and Support 
Vector Regression (SVR) based rotor power curve is presented . 
The SVR based rotor power curve closely follow s the binned and measured rotor power curve s, see figure 10. Though the 
accuracy of the SVR depends upon the quantity and quality of 
the data, as well as the appropriate method used. However, it 
should be noted  that binning is not the most accurate approach 
and also it is too slow to respond  to chan ges in conditions in time 
which are critical to early fault detection . These two limitation s 
make binning approaches  challenging in wind turbine condition 
monitoring. SVR is fast to respon d due to its nonparametric 
nature. Also, the comparative analysis su ggests that SVR is 
effective  in rotor curve estimation, however, the accuracy of 
SVM regression depends upon the quantity and quality of the 
data, as well as the method used  for fitting .

SVR models  
VI. CONCLUSION  
This paper has proposed a support vector regression for 
estimating the rotor power curve s of a wind turbine. Historical 
SCADA data sets obtained from operational wind turbines are 
used to train and test the models. The quality and quantity of 
data affect SVR model accuracy , related  to cubic inversion 
issues. Nevertheless, with limited data sets, SVR gives better 
accuracy. The SVR based rotor power curve has been compared  
with the conventional approach based on a binned rotor curve 
together with individual bin probability distributions to identify 
operational anomalies. The comparative studies suggest that 
SVR model is superior . 
Future work will develop an  uncertainty analysis for SVR 
rotor power curve and then apply this to the develop ment of an 
effective  fault detection algorithm.
