Abstract
Data-driven approaches have gained inte rest recently in the ﬁeld of wind energy. Da ta-driven online estimators have been
investigated and demonstrated in several applications such as online loads estimation, wake center position estimations,
online damage estimation. The present work demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms to formulate an
estimator of the internal loads acting on the bearings of the drivetrain of onshore wind turbines. The loads estimator is
implemented as a linear state-space model that is augmented with a non-linear feed-forward neural network. The estimatorinfers the loads time series as a function of the standard m easurements from the SCADA and condition monitoring systems
(CMS). A formal analysis of the available data is carried out to deﬁne the structure of the virtual sensor regarding the
order of the models, number of states, architecture of neural networks. Correlation coefﬁcient of 98% in the time domain
and matching of the frequency signature are achieved. Several applications are mentioned and discussed in this work suchas online estimation of the forces for monitoring and model predictive control applications.
Datengetriebener virtueller Sensor für die Online Abschätzung der Lasten im Antriebsstrang von
Windkraftanlagen
Zusammenfassung
Datengetriebene Verfahren haben in letzter Zeit im Bereich der Windenergie an Interesse zugenommen. Dabei wurden da-
tengetriebene Online-Schätzverfahren untersucht und in ve rschiedenen Anwendungen demonstriert, wie z. B. Online-Last-
schätzungen, Schätzungen der Position des Nachlaufzentrum s und Online-Schadensschätzungen. Die vorliegende Arbeit
demonstriert die Anwendung von Algorithmen des maschinellen Lernens zur Formulierung eines Schätzers für die in-ternen Lasten, die auf die Lager des Antriebsstrangs von Onshore-Windkraftanlagen wirken. Der Lastschätzer ist als
lineares Zustandsraummodell implementiert, das durch ein n ichtlineares neuronales Netz mit V orwärtskopplung ergänzt
wird. Der Schätzer leitet die Zeitreihen der Lasten als Funktion der Standardmessungen aus den SCADA- und Zustands-überwachungssystemen (CMS) ab. Es wird eine formale Analyse der verfügbaren Daten durchgeführt, um die Struktur des
virtuellen Sensors in Bezug auf die Ordnung der Modelle, die Anzahl der Zustände und die Architektur der neuronalen
Netze zu deﬁnieren. Es wird ein Korrelationskoefﬁzient von 98 % im Zeitbereich und ei ne Übereinstimmung mit der
Frequenzsignatur erreicht. Zudem werde n mehrere Anwendungen erwähnt und diskutiert, wie z. B. die Online-Schätzung
von Kräften für Überwachungs- und mode llprädiktive Steuerungsanwendungen.

measurement and control systems on the assets [ 8]. These
measurements are employed to produce an added valueto the operation of the asset using machine learning anddata analytics techniques. The states and loads estimators,known as virtual sensors, can be incorporated into condition
monitoring systems for adequate planning of maintenance
to calculate remaining lifetime of mechanical componentshence extending the product lifetime. They have been alsoincorporated into adaptive and modern control algorithms to
run the asset efﬁciently taking into consideration minimiza-
tion of fatigue damage, minimization of actuators’ lifetimeconsumption.
Recently, considerable work has been directed to tackle
the research questions regarding the applications of sys-
tem identiﬁcation and machine learning techniques to con-
struct universal estimators t h a tr e l ym a i n l yo nd a t at ob e
deployed as virtual sensors. [ 2] developed a virtual sensor
of transmitted loads in wind turbine gearboxes using neural
networks. The authors achieved coefﬁcient of determina-
tion, R
2, of more than 90% using the proposed methodol-
ogy. [ 18] also proposed an online fatigue monitoring esti-
mator using Kalman ﬁlters and least square approach anda quasi-static approach based on the low-ﬁdelity simula-
tion model on the intermediate shaft and high-speed shaft
of gearbox of wind turbines, where they achieved high co-efﬁcient of correlation in the range of 50% to 96%. [ 16]
formulated damage equivalent loads (DEL) estimator on
the torque arm of the gearbox housing of wind turbines
based on low-frequency SCADA measurements. Several re-gression algorithms were investigated, yielding correlation-coefﬁcient more than 80%. [ 5,6] developed digital twins
as state-estimators using Ka lman ﬁlters to estimate loads
on towers using standard SCADA and kinematic measure-
ments, achieving errors of estimations that is less than 8%.On the other hand, [ 1] highlighted one of the potential ap-
plications of using reduced order models and virtual sen-
sors to develop sophisticated control strategies, where they
incorporated a reduced order model of the wind turbineinto a model predictive controller that attempts to minimizethe accumulated damage on the tower root while maintain-
ing compromise between generated power and accumulated
damage in the form of economic cost function.
2 Problem Statement
The problem at hand deals with the online estimation of the
structural loads endured by the bearings in the drivetrain ofonshore wind turbines. This study considers the structuralloads on the bearing on front pinion shaft of the drivetrain
as an exemplary quantity of investigation.
The development of virtual sensors that can estimate the
loads requires several charact eristics of the estimator thatFig. 1 Qualitative re sponse of the virtual sensor according to Eq. 1
are developed in this work. The virtual sensor should fulﬁll
the following characteristics:
/CIRCLEcomputational speed and efﬁciency due to the need ofreal time estimations,
/CIRCLEminimal, i.e. delivers only the required information,
/CIRCLEcan infer the internal states of the system that are neitherpossible nor easy to measure (e.g. forces and torques),
/CIRCLEis a mathematical dynamical system that can be simu-lated forward in time and can be used for what-if scenar-ios and control applications,
/CIRCLEmathematically differentiable that can be used in gradi-
ent-based optimization algorithms (e.g. model predictive
control frameworks).
3 Methodology
The realization of the attributes mentioned in Sect. 2of
a virtual sensor imposes the implementation of a data-basedreduced order model (ROM). The formulation of the pro-posed concept is based on a re duced-order state-space for-
mulation, which is a linear approximation of the system
at hand, which is augmented with a neural network thatestimates the error mismatch of the underlying state-spacesystem.
The wind turbine system is inherently non-linear due to
for instance the presence of contact between gears or thecontroller which attempts to maximize the generated powerby varying its control variables (the pitch angle and gener-ator torque) that follow a non-linear control strategy based
on gain scheduling [ 15,22]. Accordingly, having a linear
time-invariant reduced repr esentation of the system is not
a rational approach. Hence, the need of a more sophisticatedsystem representation is cruci al. Thus, the formulation of
the virtual sensor presented in this work is based on the
assumption that the physical behavior of the investigateddynamical system can be reproduced using an additive es-

timator of reduced state-sp ace (SS) system and a neural
network (data-based) model. The combined model reads as
fM ÑcM;
fM=MSS+MNN;(1)
where cMis the system response of the high-ﬁdelity phys-
ical model (ground truth), fMis the estimated system re-
sponse using the virtual sensor, MSSandMNN are the
system responses of the linear state-space and neural net-
work models respectively. MSScan only reproduce the
prevalent quasi-static response (so called slow dynamics)of the investigated system due to the reductive nature ofthe implemented formulation, while
MNNis implemented
to be able to estimate the error mismatch between the lin-
ear state-space system and the ground truth, which is thetransient dynamics arising from higher-order dynamic non-linearities such as excitation due to gear contact. The qual-
itative overall system response is depicted in Fig. 1.
3.1 State-space Formulation
The state-space modeling approach is based on the canon-
ical linear time-invariant dynamic system representation
withminputs, qoutputs and nstate variables, which reads
Px=Ax+Bu
y=Cx+Du;(2)
where x2Rnis the states vector, y2Rqis the output vec-
tor, u2Rmis the input vector. An/STXn;Bn/STXm;Cq/STXn;Dq/STXm
are the state, input, output, feedthrough matrices respec-
tively. For dynamic systems, Dis set to Oq/STXmby default,
meaning that the system has no feedthrough.
The choice of the model order (size of x2Rnin Eq. 2)
is done according to the Hankel singular-values of the avail-
able time data. These singular-values deﬁne the “energy”
of each state in the system. The Hankel singular-values aredeﬁned as [ 4]
/ESC
H=p
/NAKi.PQ/; (3)
Fig. 2 Gray-box model in de-
ployment with an example deepneural networkwhere P;Q are the controllability and observability Grami-
ans of the system, and /ESCHis the Hankel singular-value
associated with the eigenvalue /NAKi. The highest six Hankel
singular-values captured more than 90% of the energy of thehigh-ﬁdelity system, leading to compromise between qual-
ity of estimations and complexity of the identiﬁed model,
which lead to selecting the order of the model to be in therange n= 4–6.
3.2 Neural Network Model
Feed-forward neural networks a re implemented to construct
the second element of the virtual sensor. Neural networks,according to the universal approximation theorem, can rep-
resent a wide variety of the underlying functions when given
appropriate weights and internal parameters [ 7,12,17].
The neural network is used to predict only the error mis-
match between the ground truth and the linear state-space
system, i.e.
e
SS=by−eySS
eeSS=f. u;eySS/;(4)
where byis the ground truth, eySSis the output estima-
tion of the state-space sy stem, and accordingly eSSis the
error of between the ground truth and the state-space sys-tem estimation,
eeSSis the estimated error using the neural
network, and fis the trained neural network.
The feed-forward neural networks are inherently not able
to reproduce dynamic systems behavior due to the absenceof state derivatives and/or history of inputs or outputs. How-ever, this can be handled by explicitly feeding in time his-
tory as exogenous inputs, in the form:
y
k=f. uk;uk−1;/SOH/SOH/SOH;uk−n/; (5)
where ykis the output at timestep k,uk;uk−1;/SOH/SOH/SOH;uk−nare
the inputs at timesteps k;k −1;/SOH/SOH/SOH;k−nin which nprevi-
ous timesteps are considered. This approach is very simplecompared to other approaches that inherently handle thetime dependence of dynamic systems such as recurrent neu-
ral networks (RNN), gated recurrent units (GRU) and long-

short term memory networks (LSTM), which are very com-
plex and problematic during training and deployment [ 11].
After investigating the effect of shifting the inputs in
time and feeding them to the network exogenously, a shal-
low (one layer) feed-forward neural network of lag = 2
(uk−1;uk−2in Eq. 5) with 10 neurons with sigmoid activa-
tion function was trained and deployed afterwards.
3.3 Gray-box Model
Following the identiﬁcation of two building blocks, namely
the state-space and neural network models separately, both
models are combined in the gray-box model to construct
the virtual sensor as demonstrated in Fig. 2and Eq. 6.

4 Implementation
4.1 Modeling and Simulation
The simulations in this study are executed using the IEA
Task 37 3.4 MW onshore wind turbine [ 3]. The wind turbine
conﬁguration is summarized in Table 1. A multibody sys-
tem (MBS) simulation model is set up using the commercial
MBS package Simpack [9] where different load cases are
investigated using simulated turbulent wind conditions in
accordance with the IEC 61400-1 [ 13] standard. Simpack
has been validated in comparison to other state-of-the-art
modeling software such as FAST ,HAWC2 (e.g. [ 20,21]).
The MBS model is used to generate a time-series of the
inputs and outputs of the model that are used afterwards
in training and ﬁtting of the corresponding data models
as depicted in Fig. 3which summarizes the work ﬂow of

The high-ﬁdelity MBS model features ﬂexible modeling
of tower, blades, low speed sh aft, high speed shaft using
linear beam ﬁnite elements. Fle xible contact between gears
is considered analytically using the Steiner method [ 10].
Inﬂow aerodynamics is considered using blade element
momentum theory through the coupling of the AeroDyn
solver [ 19]. Rotational bearings are modeled using linear
stiffness and damping elements. Cross coupling of stiffness
forces is considered in the main bearings.The MBS model
provides data with sampling frequency of 1000Hz.
4.2 Data Processing and Analysis
Conditions of power production design load cases (DLC
1.2 & 1.3) according to [ 13] are considered for the
data generation. Wind proﬁles with normal turbulence
(NTM) for DLC 1.2 and extreme turbulence (ETM) for
DLC 1.3 were generated using TurbSim [14], with 2
seeds for each DLC for the nominal wind velocities:

were combined into one state- space model using statisti-
cally weighted means of the parameters of the individual
models. The combination was done using the covariance

space models from each DLC, where these covariance ma-
trices indicate the uncertainty of the individual models. The

5 Results and Discussion
The proposed approach is implemented on one output
quantity exemplarily, namely the axial reaction component
on the front bearing of the pinion shaft, FPS;F;x . The inputs
to the virtual sensor considered for the investigated output
quantity are u=/STX
!Gen Pelec aPS;F aTT ˛PS;F;x/ETX
,
which are typically the available and accessible physical
measurements from the SCADA and CMS systems, where
!Gen is the generator rotational speed, Pelec is the gener-
ated electric power, aPS;F are the measured translational
acceleration of the front pini on shaft in the directions
x;y;z .aTTis the tower tip translational acceleration in
the directions x;y;z ,a n d ˛PS;F;x is the rotational accel-
eration of the front bearing of the pinion shaft around the
rotational axis x.
The validation of the proposed virtual sensor concept
is presented using comparison between the ground truth,
which is generated using the high-ﬁdelity simulation tool
Simpack , the trained linear state-space model, and the
proposed concept of augmenting the simpliﬁed linear model
with neural networks.
Fig. 5exhibits the statistical distribution of the normal-
ized with reference to the mean of the reference time se-
ries output bFPS;F;x vs the estimations using state-space
model and neural network augmented state-space model.
The state-space model (light green) can in most cases repro-
duce the median of the distribution accurately, however the
25th and 75th percentiles are deviating systematically, while
the neural network (light coral) can accurately reproduce
the median, the 25th and 75th percentiles and the minimum
and maximum ranges of the data with minimal deviations.
The deviations observed in the case of vw=3 m s−1can be
explained as follows. The cut-in wind speed of the investi-
gated turbine is 3 m s−1, where the controller ramps up the
turbine till it reaches the rated rotational speed, hence highly
non-linear behavior of the commanded generator torque is
present, which leads to larger deviations in the estimations
of the virtual sensor compar ed to the reference signals.
In order to have deeper understanding of the quality of
the proposed concept, correlation of the regression is in-
vestigated. Pearson’s coefﬁcient of correlation is used as an

The investigation of the signals in the time and frequency

predicted. Fig. 7shows the reference signal and the esti-
mated signals of DLC 1.2 for wind speed vw=9 m s−1
and an extract of 0.1 s. The linear state-space model doesnot capture the time-domain behavior well in comparison
to the augmented state-space an d neural network approach.

In this work a formulation of data-based virtual sensor wasachieved which can estimate the internal forces on mechan-
ical components, namely the front bearing of the pinion
shaft, with correlation reaching 99% in time and frequency
domains. The proposed formulation is based on the aug-mentation of a linear state-space model with a non-linearfeed forward neural network. The data used for ﬁtting and
training of the virtual sensor elements were generated using
a high-ﬁdelity multibody simulation model of the wind tur-bine system. Sect. 5highlights an excerpt of the achieved
results.
The virtual sensor can be incorporated into a monitoring
framework that can enhance the monitoring capabilities of
the standard condition monitoring systems in which it canestimate the internal forces on the mechanical componentsusing the already availabl e and accessible measurements
from SCADA and CMS systems. It can also be employed
for online vibration monitoring in the frequency domain,where the signiﬁcant natural frequencies of the system canbe identiﬁed in an online manner highlighting any abnor-mal or excessive vibration in the system. In addition to the
monitoring purposes, the virtual sensor can be integrated
to sophisticated control systems such as model predictivecontrol frameworks, where the virtual sensor can providemeasurements of the forces th at can be used for optimiza-
tion purposes such as damage accumulation on the critical
mechanical components in order to extend the lifetime ofthe investigated component or minimize the maintenancecosts due to the beneﬁt of prediction of non-measurablequantities.
