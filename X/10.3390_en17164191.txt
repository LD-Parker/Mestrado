Abstract: A significant number of first-generation offshore wind turbines (OWTs) have either reached
or are approaching the end of their operational lifespan and need to be upgraded or replaced with
more modern units. In response to this concern, governments, regulatory bodies and industries
have initiated the development of effective end-of-life (EOL) management strategies for offshore
wind infrastructure. Lifetime extension is a relatively new concept that has recently gained significant
attention within the offshore wind energy community. Extending the service lifetime of OWTs can
yield many benefits, such as reduced capital cost, increased return on investment (ROI), improved
overall energy output, and reduced toxic gas emissions. Nevertheless, it is important to identify
and prepare for the challenges that may limit the full exploitation of the potential for OWT lifetime
extension projects. The objective of this paper is to present a detailed PESTLE analysis to evaluate the
various political, economic, sociological, technological, legal, and environmental challenges that must
be overcome to successfully implement lifetime extension projects in the offshore wind energy sector.
We propose a decision framework for extending the lifetime of OWTs, involving the degradation
mechanisms and failure modes of components, remaining useful life estimation processes, safety
and structural integrity assessments, economic and environmental evaluations, and the selection of
lifetime extension technologies among remanufacturing, retrofitting, and reconditioning. Finally, we
outline some of the opportunities that lifetime extension can offer for the wind energy industry to
foster a more circular and sustainable economy in the future.

1. Introduction
Wind energy is one of the fastest-growing sustainable energy sources worldwide,
recognized as the most cost-effective form of renewable energy generation [ 1]. As a
sustainable solution, it also offers the benefits of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
and mitigating global warming, helping to support the achievement of net-zero goals
by 2050 [ 2]. The Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) reports that global wind energy
capacity reached 1021 GW by the end of 2023, reflecting a compound annual growth rate
(CAGR) of nearly 18% over the past two decades [ 3]. Many projections suggest that this
upward trend will continue, driven by ongoing technological advancements, supportive
policies, and the urgent need to transition to low-carbon energy sources.
Wind turbines are the primary technology used to harness wind power and generate
green electricity. Wind turbine technology has evolved significantly over the past decades,
with improvements in design, materials, and efficiency. The technology now comes in
various design configurations (horizontal axis or vertical axis, single-rotor or multi-rotor),
drivetrain concepts (geared or direct-drive systems), sizes (small: with a nominal power
output of less than 50 kW, medium: with a nominal power output between 50 kW and
500 kW, and large: with a nominal power output above 500 kW), locations (onshore or off-
shore), type of offshore support structure (fixed-bottom: gravity-based structure, monopile,

tripod and jacket, or floating: spar-buoy, tension leg platform, and semi-submersible), and
applications (residential use or commercial use) [ 4,5]. All these developments have made
wind energy a more viable and cost-effective solution for renewable electricity generation.
A wind farm is a collection of wind turbines installed in a specific area and connected
through a power substation. The substation is a crucial component of the wind farm
infrastructure, acting as the central hub for managing and distributing the electricity
generated by the wind turbines to homes and businesses. To support the development
of a wind farm, substantial investment in infrastructure is required. This includes not
only the wind turbines themselves but also the necessary supporting systems, including
transportation networks, foundation installation, electrical infrastructure, cabling and
transmission lines, monitoring systems and maintenance facilities [ 6]. The design lifetime
of wind farms is typically between twenty to thirty years, during which they are expected to
operate reliably and safely. A significant proportion of the wind farms that were built during
the 1990s and early 2000s have reached, or are nearing, the end of their life expectancy. The
Renewable Energy Foundation [ 7] published a wind energy dataset containing information
on 282 wind turbines in the UK and 823 wind turbines in Denmark, with ages ranging from
zero to nineteen years. Staffell and Green [ 8] reported that about 45 wind farms built in the
UK in the 1990s were more than fifteen years old by the year 2014. Out of these 45 wind
farms, 5 wind farms were repowered in their fifteenth year of operation, 5 wind farms
operated for between sixteen and twenty years before being repowered, and 35 wind farms
(i.e., 78%) were still operational. Ortegon et al. [ 9] reported that approximately 40,000 wind
turbines will reach the end of their original design life between 2025 and 2030, necessitating
urgent and effective actions to address the associated challenges. Ziegler et al. [ 10] reported
that by 2016, the total number of onshore wind turbines exceeding 20 years of operational
life was approximately 3400 in Germany, 1250 in Denmark, 500 in Spain, and 19 in the UK.
They also provided evidence indicating that the number of wind farms reaching the end of
their operational lifespan will continue to rise in the coming years.
The impending wave of aging wind farms poses significant challenges to the wind
energy sector, including instability in power supply, fluctuations in electricity prices, envi-
ronmental pollution, biodiversity loss, increased accident rates, and higher maintenance
costs. Addressing these challenges is crucial for ensuring the long-term sustainability and
reliability of wind energy. In response to this concern, governments, regulatory bodies, the
wind energy industry, and other stakeholders have initiated the development of effective
end-of-life (EOL) management strategies for wind farms and their supporting infrastruc-
ture. In principle, there are three strategies that can be adopted for the EOL management
of wind farms. These strategies, as shown in Figure 1, include lifetime extension ,repowering,
and decommissioning [11]. Lifetime extension involves prolonging the service life of wind
farms for some additional years beyond their original design life. Repowering involves
upgrading or replacing old wind turbines with modern, higher-capacity, and more efficient
models to improve the overall energy output of the wind farm [ 12]. Decommissioning is the
final phase in the lifespan of a wind farm project, considered when other EOL strategies are
not suitable [ 13,14]. During decommissioning, wind farm infrastructure is carefully disman-
tled, and wind turbines are systematically removed. References [ 15,16] offer further details
on the EOL management strategies for wind farms and their practical implementation.
Among the various EOL management strategies, lifetime extension is considered a
highly appealing option in the offshore wind energy sector. This approach can provide a
wide range of benefits to wind energy investors, owners, asset managers, service providers,
health and safety authorities, public policymakers, environment protection agencies, reg-
ulatory bodies, and others. A brief list of the benefits of extending the operational life of
offshore wind turbines (OWTs) is provided below [17]:

- Economic bene ﬁts: Lifetime extension saves capital expenditures (CapEx) needed for 
constructing new wind farms, mitigates ﬁnancial risks compared to investing in 
green ﬁeld projects, enhances return on investment (ROI), improves energy output, 
and ultimately lowers the levelized cost of electricity (LCoE). 
- Technical bene ﬁts: Lifetime extension improves the operational condition of aging 
OWTs by conducting repairs on damaged parts, implementing software upgrades 
and adjustments, and updating safety systems and protocols to an acceptable level. 
- Social bene ﬁts: Lifetime extension secures existing jobs while also potentially creating 
new job opportunities in the second-hand OWT sector (i.e., repair, refurbishment, 
and remanufacturing). 
- Environmental bene ﬁts: Lifetime extension helps protect the marine ecosystem and 
preserve the natural environment by redu cing pollutant emissions associated with 
constructing new wind farms. It also suppo rts biodiversity and maintains ecological 
balance in marine environments by minimi zing disturbances to  marine habitats.

most eﬃcient and e ﬀective methods used by industries to assess factors that impact their 
operations and strategic decisions. Followin g this analysis, a decision framework is pro-

technologies. We then outline some of the opportunities that lifetime extension can o ﬀer 
for the wind energy industry to promote a mo re circular and sustainable economy in the 
future. Although the study primarily focuses on the wind energy sector, it also discusses 
relevant experiences of lifetime extension in other energy industries.

2. PESTLE Analysis for Lifetime Extension of OWTs
This section aims to analyze and evaluate the various challenges associated with OWT
lifetime extension projects. First, an overview of the PESTLE technique is provided in
Section 2.1, followed by a PESTLE analysis in Section 2.2.
2.1. PESTLE Background
PESTLE is an analytical tool that was first introduced in 1967 by Francis Aguilar, an
American scholar specializing in strategic planning [ 18]. PESTLE stands for six factors. The
letter ‘P’ denotes political factors. Such factors include regulatory policies, government
stability, tax policies, and trade regulations that can impact the feasibility and execution of
OWT lifetime extension projects. The letter ‘E’ represents economic factors. These factors
include elements that can influence the cost, funding, and financial viability of OWT lifetime
extension projects. The third letter, ‘S’, denotes social factors. Social factors include public
attitudes towards prolonging the presence of OWTs in the marine environment and the
availability of a skilled workforce. The fourth letter, ‘T’, denotes technological factors. These
factors include technological advancements and innovations that can impact the feasibility
and efficiency of OWT lifetime extension projects. The fifth letter, ‘L’, denotes legal aspects.
The legal aspects determine the regulatory framework and compliance requirements that
OWT lifetime extension projects must adhere to. The last letter, ‘E’, denotes environmental
factors. These factors include the ecological and environmental impact of OWT lifetime
extension projects, such as their effects on marine life, coastal ecosystems and climate
change mitigation.
By systematically analyzing the six PESTLE factors, businesses can gain a comprehen-
sive understanding of their external environment and make informed decisions. This model
has been widely adopted by successful global corporations, such as Tesla and BMW, in their
strategic planning process, business expansion decisions, workforce planning, product
development, and marketing planning [ 19]. In the wind energy sector, the PESTLE tool has
been employed for various applications, including wind farm development, power genera-
tion planning, and wind turbine technology selection [ 20–22]. However, this technique has
received very little attention in the literature regarding EOL planning and decision-making.
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to perform a PESTLE analysis aimed at
better understanding the challenges and opportunities that lifetime extension may bring to
the offshore wind energy sector.
To conduct a successful PESTLE analysis, it is necessary to collect up-to-date infor-
mation from reliable sources to understand the current state of each factor. Therefore, the
first step in the PESTLE analysis is to assemble a team of experts with extensive knowl-
edge and experience in six areas, including political, economic, social, technological, legal,
and environmental factors. For this study, six experts in the wind energy domain were
interviewed, each specializing in one of the six areas. For instance, the technical expert
was interviewed about the technological aspects of OWT lifetime extension. Similarly, the
environmental expert was consulted about the environmental impacts of OWT lifetime
extension, with a focus on greenhouse gas emissions and waste generation. The following
section summarizes the findings of the PESTLE analysis for OWT lifetime extension.
2.2. PESTLE Analysis for OWT Lifetime Extension
2.2.1. Political Challenges
Political challenges related to the lifetime extension of OWTs include various factors.
Currently, obtaining permits and licenses for the extended operation of OWTs involves
navigating complex bureaucratic processes and ensuring compliance with updated envi-
ronmental and safety standards. Continuous changes in government policies regarding
wind energy have, in some cases, impacted the feasibility and approval processes for
OWT lifetime extension projects. Moreover, since offshore wind projects often involve
international cooperation and agreements, extending the lifespan of these projects may
require careful geopolitical considerations. Shifts in public policy toward wind energy can
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2024 ,17, 4191 5 of 33
also influence financial incentives, subsidies, and support mechanisms that are crucial for
extending the lifespan of OWTs. To address these political challenges, it is essential to foster
collaboration among stakeholders, engage proactively with regulatory bodies, and adhere
to evolving environmental and safety standards to ensure the sustainable extension of the
OWT lifecycle.
2.2.2. Economic Challenges
Maintaining the integrity of existing OWTs and redeploying them for continuous
operation with minimal modifications can result in significant cost savings for wind farm
owners and other stakeholders in the wind energy sector. Economics is a primary driver for
wind farm owners when deciding to extend the lifetime of OWTs. Like conventional energy
industries, where lifetime extension decisions depend on production volume and cost,
the key economic factor in the wind energy industry is the spot price of electricity. Some
wind farm owners still earn profits from electricity tariffs through government subsidies.
However, with the increasing number of zero-subsidy projects in the offshore wind energy
sector, the future development of electricity prices remains uncertain. Momentum Energy
Group reported that wind farms operating for more than 15 years would be more affected by
lower electricity prices [ 23]. Therefore, changes in the current pricing regime of electricity
would mean that wind farm owners must settle for competitive market prices. This
uncertainty can potentially cause numerous economic challenges for lifetime extension
projects in the offshore wind energy industry.
Settling for competitive market prices could reduce the profitability of wind farm
projects and make extending the lifetime of existing OWTs less financially viable. In a
research study, Abadie and Goicoechea [ 24] studied the economic benefits of lifetime
extension for a wind farm in Spain, considering the seasonal evolution of future hourly
electricity prices. They proposed models to estimate income gained under two scenarios:
one for hourly electricity prices, incorporating seasonality, mean reversion, jumps, and
non-working day effects, and another for the hourly capacity factor, also accounting for
seasonality. The authors introduced “ re-blading ” as a strategy to extend the lifetime of OWTs.
2.2.3. Sociological Challenges
Currently, offshore wind farm owners are more inclined to decommission or repower
old OWTs rather than extend their operational lifetime. This hesitation to extend opera-
tional lifetimes is partly due to a lack of understandig of the associated social benefits. A
cultural breakthrough is essential for stakeholders in the offshore wind energy industry
to fully understand and gain acceptance for extending the operational lifetime of existing
OWTs. Achieving this requires comprehensive education and awareness efforts aimed at
demonstrating the societal benefits of extending OWT lifetimes. Additionally, the wind
energy industry, unlike conventional energy industries, lacks personnel with the requisite
skills, experience, and knowledge to undertake lifetime extension projects. Efforts should
be made to train personnel to enhance their understanding of lifetime extension practice.
2.2.4. Technological/Technical Challenges
The technological/technical challenges associated with the lifetime extension of OWTs
include the degradation of structures and components, the lack of good quality data,
appropriate tools to optimize maintenance activities, technology obsolescence, and proper
procedures to help decision-makers select the most suitable lifetime extension technology
for different components. These challenges are discussed in detail in the following sections.
Degradation of OWT Structures and Components
OWTs are exposed to various dynamic loads throughout their service lives, originat-
ing from sources such as wind and wave forces, ice impact, collisions, or earthquakes.
These environmentally and operationally induced loads may cause degradation, which,
if not controlled, can potentially lead to the collapse of the OWT. Therefore, assessing the
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2024 ,17, 4191 6 of 33
degradation levels of OWT structures and components using appropriate methodologies
is essential for wind farm managers to determine asset conditions and associated failure
risks. Typical physical degradation mechanisms that negatively impact the integrity of
OWT installations include corrosion, fatigue, overload fracture, wear, tear, and scour. Ad-
ditionally, components such as gearboxes, bearings, and bolts in mounted systems may
suffer from fatigue-related damage over time. This damage can compromise the overall
performance and safety of the OWTs, thereby affecting their remaining useful life (RUL).
During the lifetime extension phase of operation, structural components of OWTs, such as
towers and foundations, may experience increased degradation. This accelerated degra-
dation can reduce the fatigue strength of OWT structures, leading to a higher failure rate,
increased operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, and reduced safety during the extended
operational period.
One of the challenges frequently reported in the literature is that fatigue calculations
performed during the design phase of OWTs often rely on various assumptions and simpli-
fications, leading to conservative estimates [ 25]. However, during the lifetime extension
phase, the nature and severity of loading can vary significantly, necessitating adjustments
to these initially conservative findings. Therefore, decision-makers are challenged to mini-
mize these conservative outcomes to meet industry standards during the lifetime extension
phase. To address this challenge, the offshore wind energy industry must enhance cur-
rent fatigue analysis practices by adopting more rigorous, analytical, and computational
approaches. This improvement is essential to accurately assess the fatigue life of OWTs
under evolving operational conditions and ensure compliance with safety and performance
requirements. In a research study, Nielsen et al. [ 26] highlighted that accurately predicting
the residual fatigue life of OWT structures at the end of their original lifecycle is a signifi-
cant technical challenge facing the offshore wind energy industry. To address this issue,
they proposed using probabilistic and risk-based approaches to reassess the fatigue life of
OWTs. By utilizing models similar to those used for calibrating partial safety factors in IEC
61400-1 [ 27], they discovered that probabilistic fatigue life assessments resulted in longer
projected lifespans compared to deterministic assessment methods. Similarly, in another
work, Nielsen and Sørensen [ 28] determined specific target reliability levels for the lifetime
extension of OWTs, incorporating the economic consequences associated with the risk of
structural failure. A target annual reliability index of approximately 3.1 was established for
the lifetime extension of OWT structural components, which is 0.2 lower than the target
reliability index of 3.3 used for designing new wind turbines [27].
Another significant technical challenge in the offshore wind energy industry is the
continued reliance on visual inspection for assessing OWT degradation. This approach pre-
dominantly depends on the accumulated experience of engineers and inspectors, resulting
in subjective assessments. Consequently, due to the inherent uncertainties associated with
expert judgment, the effectiveness of visual inspection in accurately evaluating degradation
levels is considered limited, particularly during the lifetime extension phase of operation.
Expanding on this, advanced technologies such as non-destructive testing (NDT) meth-
ods and structural health monitoring (SHM) systems offer more precise and data-driven
alternatives to traditional visual inspections. These technologies provide continuous and
objective data on structural integrity, aiding in more informed decisions regarding the
lifetime extension of OWTs.
Lack of Good Quality Data
Lifetime extension analysis of OWTs requires high-quality data from the design,
manufacturing, construction, installation, and operation and maintenance (O&M) stages.
The importance of good quality data in ensuring reliability and maintainability within
the wind energy industry was discussed by Guo et al. [ 29] and Hameed et al. [ 30]. Igba
et al. [ 31] pointed out that the wind energy industry continues to grapple with the challenge
of collecting appropriate data, largely due to a significant number of wind farms still
relying on offline methods for in-service data collection. Data gathered through these
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2024 ,17, 4191 7 of 33
offline methods are beset with issues such as measurement errors, potential falsification of
records, and improper codification. For a deeper exploration of the challenges associated
with manual data collection and codification in the wind energy industry, readers are
encouraged to review the reference [ 32]. Igba et al. [ 33] highlighted that the limited
maturity of fault diagnosis and prognosis technologies in OWTs inspection further hinders
the acquisition of high-quality data. Martinez-Luengo et al. [ 34] noted that discrepancies in
historical data, such as noisy or missing information, can significantly impact decisions
regarding structural integrity and the extension of the lifetime of offshore wind turbines.
Given these challenges, it is imperative for the offshore wind energy industry to intensify
its efforts to establish a comprehensive database to support analyses for OWT lifetime
extension projects. In recent years, some data sources, such as SPARTA [ 35], have become
available to support lifetime extension decision-making for OWTs.
Lack of Appropriate Tools to Optimize Maintenance Activities
Maintenance activities play a key role in the successful implementation of lifetime
extension projects in the offshore wind energy sector. Increasing the number of preven-
tive maintenance (PM) actions during the lifetime extension phase of OWTs will enhance
reliability by reducing the rate of deterioration. However, this increase in PM actions
can lead to higher O&M costs. Therefore, it is crucial to develop efficient tools for plan-
ning OWT maintenance activities. These tools should be capable of flexibly incorporating
weather dynamics, enabling accurate scheduling and execution of maintenance tasks even
under variable and challenging environmental conditions [ 36]. By optimizing maintenance
planning, the industry can balance the trade-off between improved reliability and the asso-
ciated costs, ensuring sustainable and cost-effective lifetime extension of OWTs. A report
published by Wind Energy Ireland [ 37] outlines the significance of conducting routine
inspection and maintenance on OWTs for lifetime extension. The report emphasizes that
maintenance activities, including lubrication, bolt tightening, and component replacements,
are essential to maintaining the structural integrity and operational efficiency of OWTs
during the extended lifetime. The report also highlights the importance of developing a
robust maintenance strategy that incorporates predictive maintenance technologies, such
as condition monitoring systems and data analytics, to optimize maintenance schedules
during the OWT lifetime extension phase.
Technology Obsolescence
With advancements in design, materials, and digital signal processing, technology
obsolescence has become a major concern in the offshore wind energy sector. As newer and
more efficient OWT models are introduced, older turbines become less competitive and
harder to maintain. This issue is particularly critical during the lifetime extension phase,
where outdated components and systems may struggle to integrate with modern upgraded
units. Additionally, older OWTs may lack compatibility with advanced monitoring and
predictive maintenance tools that newer models offer, which can hinder effective man-
agement of turbine health and lead to increased risks of failure and higher maintenance
costs. Upgrading control systems, sensors, and software can be expensive and technically
challenging, especially for OWTs designed with now-outdated technology standards. These
challenges present significant obstacles for wind farm owners seeking to extend the opera-
tional life of existing OWTs. To address technology obsolescence and minimize its impact
during the lifetime extension phase, the wind energy sector must develop standardized
protocols for integrating new technologies with older systems. By implementing robust
obsolescence management strategies from the design stages of OWTs, the industry can
ensure that lifetime extension projects remain viable and cost-effective. Ortegon et al. [ 38]
investigated the impact of technological evolution on the remanufacturing of wind turbines
as a strategy to extend their lifetime. Using a system dynamics approach, they modeled
the interactions between maintenance activities, reliability, and technological obsolescence.
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2024 ,17, 4191 8 of 33
Their analysis concluded that technological obsolescence would increase the overall cost of
lifetime extension projects.
Selection of the Most Suitable Lifetime Extension Technology
Based on the outcomes of lifetime extension assessments, wind farm owners should
select the most suitable technology for extending the life of each OWT component. Making
such a critical decision involves a trade-off between conflicting criteria such as improved
performance, increased costs, and other considerations. This indicates that selecting the
most suitable lifetime extension technology among different options (remanufacturing,
retrofitting, reconditioning, etc.) is a challenging task. Multi-criteria decision analysis
(MCDA) and cost–benefit analysis (CBA) techniques can be useful in handling such cases
effectively [ 39]. However, these techniques require extensive data collection and processing.
Due to the lack of knowledge and previous experience regarding lifetime extension in the
offshore wind energy industry, uncertainties are involved in the decision-making process.
Thus, stakeholders must develop tools and models capable of handling uncertainties in the
OWT lifetime extension decision-making process.
2.2.5. Legal Challenges
The availability of regulations, standards, and guidance documents is crucial for the
implementation of OWT lifetime extension projects. These resources assure wind farm man-
agers that extending the operational lifetime of OWTs will not introduce additional risks
regarding health, safety, and environmental issues. For example, in the offshore oil and gas
industry, the NORSOK U-009 [ 40] and NORSOK Y-002 [ 41] standards have been developed
to support lifetime extension assessments for subsea systems and transportation infrastruc-
ture, respectively. The ISO/TS 12747 standard [ 42] also provides guidance on assessing the
feasibility of extending the service life of pipeline systems beyond their specified design life.
Lifetime extension standards and requirements in the wind energy industry are still evolv-
ing and tend to be prescriptive in nature. Currently, four standards—DNVGL -ST-0262 [ 43],
DNVGL-SE-0263 [ 44], IEC/TS 61400-28 [ 45], and IEA Wind TCP Task 42 [ 46]—provide
general technical requirements and guidance for the lifetime extension analysis of wind
turbines. A major drawback of these standards is that they use uniform procedures to
assess all control and protection systems, as well as load-transferring components of wind
turbines, without accounting for their unique failure modes and operational conditions [ 47].
This generic approach may not adequately address the specific needs and challenges of the
environments in which OWTs operate. Therefore, there is a need for more tailored stan-
dards and assessment procedures that consider the unique conditions and requirements of
both onshore and offshore settings.
2.2.6. Environmental/Ecological Challenges
Lifetime extension of OWTs offers many environmental and ecological benefits, in-
cluding reduced natural resource use, decreased consumption of raw materials, and lower
energy usage with associated carbon savings. However, an OWT lifetime extension still has
some negative environmental consequences, which could be a source of concern to the pub-
lic. One of the environmental challenges is the noise generated during the implementation
of lifetime extension technologies onsite. This noise can disturb marine and bird life, as well
as nearby human communities [ 48]. Additionally, extended use of existing infrastructure
can add to visual clutter, especially in coastal areas where the presence of OWTs is already a
contentious issue. Other potential environmental-ecological impacts include the risk of oil
and chemical spills from maintenance activities, the disturbance of seabed habitats during
structural reinforcements, and the possible increased risk of collisions with marine vessels
due to prolonged turbine presence [49].
The next section reviews experiences and lessons that the wind energy industry can
learn from other energy sectors.

3. Experiences and Lessons Learned from Conventional Energy Industries
To successfully undertake lifetime extension projects in the offshore wind energy
industry, it is crucial to learn from the best practices and experiences of other conventional
energy industries that have implemented similar programs. Extensive research on lifetime
extension has been conducted in the nuclear power and offshore oil and gas industries. In
contrast, the wind energy industry is relatively new to this topic. The following subsections
summarize experiences from the nuclear power and offshore oil and gas sectors and explore
how these can address gaps in the wind energy industry.
3.1. Nuclear Power Industry
A significant number of nuclear power plants will reach the end of their operating
lives in the coming years. These plants are usually designed for a technical life of 40 years,
which may be extended by an additional 10 to 20 years [ 50]. To ensure the safe operation
of critical equipment during the extended lifetime, the nuclear power industry follows
several processes to meet regulatory requirements. Lifetime extension management in this
industry focuses on maintaining the availability of essential safety functions throughout
the plant’s extended life. Recognizing the potential dangers of aging on plant safety, the
industry has developed a comprehensive framework for lifetime extension analysis. The
following studies on life extension have been conducted in the nuclear power industry:
Bharteey and Hart [ 51] proposed a methodology to support the lifetime extension
of low- and medium-voltage equipment in the nuclear power industry. Stevens and
Ranganath [ 52] used data from online fatigue monitoring systems as a technical basis for
the lifetime extension analysis of boiling water reactor (BWR) components in nuclear power
plants. Shah and MacDonald [ 53] discussed the issue of aging degradation and lifetime
extension of light water reactor (LWR) components in nuclear power plants. Saldanha
and Frutuoso e Melo [ 54] proposed a generalized non-homogeneous Poisson process
(NHPP) model to predict the rate of occurrence of failure (ROCOF) for water pumps in a
nuclear power plant, aiding in informed decision-making regarding their lifetime extension.
Asmolov et al. [ 55] reported the outcomes of extending the service life of the Novovoronezh
nuclear power plant beyond 45 years. Trampus [ 56] provided examples from the Paks
nuclear power plant in Hungary, highlighting the substantial role and importance of non-
destructive evaluation (NDE) in ensuring the long-term integrity of nuclear components.
These examples included ultrasonic and eddy current examinations of critical areas and
sub-components of the reactor pressure vessel, reactor internals, the steam generator, and
various pipeline systems. Kim et al. [ 57] conducted an analysis of cost savings achieved
by extending the lifetime of nuclear power plants in the United States. They estimated
that extending the lifetime of nuclear power plants from 40 years to 60 and 100 years
would result in cost savings of $330 billion and $500 billion, respectively. In a recent study,
Woo [ 58] proposed a methodology based on system dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations
to support the lifetime extension of nuclear power plants. In another more recent study,
Dimova [ 59] adopted a five-step approach for the evaluation of the lifetime extension of
nuclear power plant components. The five steps included: (i) classifying critical equipment;
(ii) identifying the dominant degradation mechanisms of the equipment; (iii) determining
the effects of equipment degradation on nuclear power plant integrity; (iv) identifying
methods to control the degradation effects; and (v) developing methodologies to evaluate
the efficacy of the control measures.
3.2. Offshore Oil and Gas Industry
There has been a steady growth in the number of offshore oil and gas installations
reaching the end of their original design life. Stacey et al. [ 60] and Stacey [ 61] reported that
over 50% of the fixed installations in the UK sector of the North Sea have exceeded their
original design life. Examples of lifetime extension projects executed in the offshore oil and
gas industry include Ekofisk (from 2005 to 2015), Asgard C (from 2005 to 2018), Ula (from
2005 to 2028), Statfjord A (from 2007 to 2028), Valhall QP (from 2007 to 2010), Valhall PCP
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

and DP (from 2007 to 2015), Hod (from 2008 to 2028), Norpipe oil (from 2008 to 2028), and
Veslefrikk A and B (from 2009 to 2020) [ 62]. Other studies conducted on lifetime extension
of offshore oil and gas assets are summarized below.
Jansen and Van [ 63] and Rinc ón et al. [ 64] proposed risk-based methodologies for
lifetime extension of oil and gas pipelines. Hudson [ 65] discussed how companies can
optimize the use of their topside facilities, time, and resources during the lifetime extension
period of operation. Saunders and Sullivan [ 66] discussed various requirements, methods,
and technologies developed for the lifetime extension of flexible pipes in the oil and gas
industry. Vaidya and Rausand [ 67] discussed various requirements, including degradation
modeling and uncertain environmental and operational conditions, for decision-making on
lifetime extension in the subsea oil and gas industry. Brandt and Mohd Sarif [ 68] developed
an integrated technical and economic technique to support lifetime extension of topside
facilities in the oil and gas industry. Tveit et al. [ 69] discussed the innovations that could
be used by companies to resolve the technical challenges of extending the RUL of subsea
separators and pumps. Ram írez and Utne [ 70] proposed a dynamic Bayesian network
model for assessing the technical feasibility of extending the lifetime of a firewater pump
system in an oil and gas facility.
Shafiee et al. [ 71] developed a lifetime extension assessment framework that incor-
porates both equipment health and economic value factors. They applied this model to
support the extension of water deluge systems in offshore oil installations. Animah and
Shafiee [ 72] provided guidelines for oil and gas operators to meet lifetime extension require-
ments and optimize costs. The framework included modules for condition assessment, RUL
prediction, and lifetime extension decision-making. Its benefits were demonstrated through
a case study of a three-phase separator system on a West African oil platform. Ferreira
et al. [ 73] provided guidelines for lifetime extension process management in the Brazilian
oil and gas industry. Shafiee and Animah [ 74] proposed a model for evaluating risks
and prioritizing mitigation strategies for subsea facilities operating in high-pressure/high-
temperature (HPHT) environments over their extended lifetime. To illustrate the model, a
case study of subsea manifolds and flowlines was provided, with results evaluated and
discussed. Oubella [ 75] proposed a systematic approach for the lifetime extension assess-
ment of the pressure vessels and piping of an old offshore oil and gas platform constructed
in the mid-1980s. Ferreira et al. [ 76] discussed strategies for evaluating and managing
asset obsolescence during the lifetime extension of oil and gas facilities. They proposed a
framework with six stages for managing obsolescence and validated it with a case study
from the Brazilian oil and gas industry.
Table 1 summarizes the lessons learned from the nuclear power and offshore oil
and gas industries. These insights can be applied to the wind energy sector to guide
lifetime extension practices. A comprehensive feasibility assessment framework that
integrates technical, economic, environmental, social, and political factors is crucial for
making informed decisions on OWT lifetime extension. Key data, including test reports,
degradation and condition monitoring, maintenance records, and design information,
are essential for a thorough lifetime extension analysis. Probabilistic Safety Assessment
(PSA) tools can help identify which OWT components are suitable for lifetime extension.
Additionally, developing reliable models to predict component degradation, estimate RUL,
and mitigate risks will significantly benefit the wind energy industry. Such models will
improve the ability to forecast failures, optimize maintenance schedules, and ensure the
safe and cost-effective operation of OWTs throughout their extended lifespan.

4. Lifetime Extension Process for OWTs
In this section, we discuss life estimation processes, aging failure modes, and effec-
tive strategies to support informed decision-making for the lifetime extension of OWT
subsystems and components.
OWTs consist of various subsystems and components, each with unique characteristics
and potential failure modes. Understanding these mechanisms and assessing the health of
components is crucial for developing effective strategies to extend their operational life.
Figure 2 illustrates the categorization of OWT subsystems and components addressed in
this study. As depicted, OWTs are categorized into four subsystems: electrical subsys-
tems, mechanical subsystems, power control subsystems, and structural components. By
analyzing each subsystem and component in detail, we can develop targeted strategies

tailored to the lifetime extension of each individual part. This holistic approach ensures
that lifetime extension decisions are well-informed, balanced, and aligned with several key
objectives in the wind energy industry, including energy efficiency, safety standards, and
cost-effectiveness.

 several key objectives in the wind energy industry, including energy e ﬃciency, safety 
standards, and cost-e ﬀectiveness. 
 
Figure 2. OWT subsystems and components. 
4.1. Lifetime Estimation Process and Aging Failure Mode Analysis 
During the planning and design phases of o ﬀshore wind farms, failure modes are 
exhaustively identi ﬁed, with particular emphasis on critical areas to mitigate risks in the 
installation and operation of OWTs. Sha ﬁee and Dinmohammadi [77] indicated that risk 
analysis tools such as Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Failure Mode, E ﬀects, and Criticality 
Analysis (FMECA), and Design of Experiments (DOE) are used for identifying failure 
modes during the design phase of OWTs. While these tools may be e ﬀective in the design 
phase, their application is limited during th e lifetime extension phase of operation. For 
eﬀective and e ﬃcient lifetime extension decision-making, it is essential to focus on the 
failure modes that are most likely to impact  operations during the extended lifetime. 
Moreover, the environmental and operational conditions must be taken into consideration 
to identify potential failure modes and calc ulate the RUL. Since these conditions can 
change by the end of the original design l ife, RUL estimations must be updated with new 
data to ensure con ﬁdence in lifetime extension decisions. In cases where good quality data 
is not readily available, decision-makers can rely on alternative methods such as expert 
judgment or using data from similar OWT types as a guide. 
In what follows, the lifetime estimation processes and key aging failure modes cor-
responding to each subsystem and component of the OWT system are analyzed. 
4.1.1. Electrical Subsystems 
The failure of electrical subsystems duri ng the lifetime extension phase of OWT op-
erations can lead to signi ﬁcant consequences. Beyond economic impacts for wind farm 
owners, such failures ca n result in potential ﬁre outbreaks. Additionally, the failure of 
electrical subsystems could lead to oil leak ages, raising serious environmental concerns. 
It is reported that failures of electrical subsystems or components of OWTs can also pose 
health and safety risks for personnel working onsite [78]. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze 
aging failure modes for each electrical subsystem and component of OWTs and employ 
appropriate lifetime estimation appr oaches to mitigate these risks.

4.1. Lifetime Estimation Process and Aging Failure Mode Analysis
During the planning and design phases of offshore wind farms, failure modes are
exhaustively identified, with particular emphasis on critical areas to mitigate risks in the
installation and operation of OWTs. Shafiee and Dinmohammadi [ 77] indicated that risk
analysis tools such as Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality
Analysis (FMECA), and Design of Experiments (DOE) are used for identifying failure
modes during the design phase of OWTs. While these tools may be effective in the design
phase, their application is limited during the lifetime extension phase of operation. For
effective and efficient lifetime extension decision-making, it is essential to focus on the
failure modes that are most likely to impact operations during the extended lifetime.
Moreover, the environmental and operational conditions must be taken into consideration
to identify potential failure modes and calculate the RUL. Since these conditions can change
by the end of the original design life, RUL estimations must be updated with new data to
ensure confidence in lifetime extension decisions. In cases where good quality data is not
readily available, decision-makers can rely on alternative methods such as expert judgment
or using data from similar OWT types as a guide.
In what follows, the lifetime estimation processes and key aging failure modes corre-
sponding to each subsystem and component of the OWT system are analyzed.
4.1.1. Electrical Subsystems
The failure of electrical subsystems during the lifetime extension phase of OWT
operations can lead to significant consequences. Beyond economic impacts for wind farm
owners, such failures can result in potential fire outbreaks. Additionally, the failure of
electrical subsystems could lead to oil leakages, raising serious environmental concerns.
It is reported that failures of electrical subsystems or components of OWTs can also pose
health and safety risks for personnel working onsite [ 78]. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze
aging failure modes for each electrical subsystem and component of OWTs and employ
appropriate lifetime estimation approaches to mitigate these risks.

Generator
The generator is one of the high-risk subsystems of OWTs. In the offshore wind energy
industry, two common generator systems are used: synchronous generators with perma-
nent magnet coils installed on the rotor and double-fed induction generators. The lifetime
estimation procedure for generator systems must ensure that the reliability and function-
ality of critical components such as bearings, stators, and rotors have not degraded over
time. This is achieved through regular inspection and maintenance of these components
throughout the original design life of the OWT. Consequently, the RUL of a generator can be
estimated by statistically analyzing inspection and maintenance records. This assessment
helps determine whether the generator can continue to maintain electrical contact safely
and effectively for power generation throughout the lifetime extension phase of operation.
Popa et al. [ 79] indicated that for induction generators, bearings account for almost 40% of
failures, followed by stator failures at 38% and rotor failures at 10%. Luengo and Kolios [ 80]
identified that potential failure modes associated with induction generators used in OWTs
include opening or shorting of inter-turn failures at the stator or rotor winding circuits,
abnormal connections in stator windings, dynamic eccentricity, broken rotor bars, cracked
end-rings, and static and dynamic air-gap eccentricities. However, not all of these failure
modes occur with the same frequency during the extended lifetime. The potential aging
failure modes of OWT generators during the lifetime extension phase could primarily
involve issues such as cracks in rotor bars or the total breakage of rotor bars due to higher
stresses. These specific failure modes are critical considerations for ensuring the continued
safe and reliable operation of the generator beyond its original design life.
Cables
Cables play a critical role in delivering power generated by OWTs to substations and
serving as export lines to transmit electricity from substations to the grid. Various types of
cables are used in the wind energy industry, including power transmission and distribution
cables, control cables, electronic cables, data transmission cables, and fiber optic cables.
For offshore wind energy applications, submarine cables connect offshore wind farms to
offshore transformer substations, which then link to the onshore grid. Submarine cables are
susceptible to age-related degradation, such as water treeing and deterioration of polymeric
materials. Water treeing occurs when cable dielectric material is attacked by water, moisture,
or vapor. Aging of insulation material refers to the gradual loss of dielectric strength due to
factors like high temperatures, cyclic thermal, electric, and mechanical stresses, as well as
environmental effects. These aging failure modes can compromise cable properties and
lead to complete cable failure during the extended lifetime. Therefore, thorough assessment
and testing are essential to ensure the continued reliability and safety of cables in offshore
wind energy applications. Currently, various diagnostic testing methods are employed to
predict the RUL of submarine cables [81]. These tests include:
- Low-voltage time domain reflectometry test : This test measures the true length of the cable,
identifies splice locations, and assesses the condition of the concentric neutral.
- Leakage current measurements at direct voltages or below the peak operating voltage : This
test aims to detect cables that may be affected by water treeing.
- Partial discharge measurements : This test is used to detect potential difference (PD) sites
using time domain reflectometry.
- Breakdown voltage test : This test uses a cos-rectangular or sine wave test supply to
locate breakdown sites in buried cables for recovery and examination.
Converter, Filters and Circuit Breakers
The power converter plays a crucial role as the interface between the generator and the
power grid. Depending on its location, the converter must meet operational requirements
for both the generator side and the grid side. As converters age, their condition gradually
deteriorates, increasing the risk of failure towards the end of their original design life. To
assess the RUL of converters, maintenance and operational data must be analyzed using
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2024 ,17, 4191 14 of 33
appropriate statistical methods to identify potential trends. Converters and filters are
susceptible to electrical faults such as converter burnout and capacitor fires [ 82]. Circuit
breakers, on the other hand, are prone to wear and tear over time. Therefore, conducting
root cause analysis on a case-by-case basis is recommended for the lifetime assessment of
converters. This approach helps identify specific issues affecting converter reliability and
informs decisions on maintenance strategies and potential upgrades to ensure continued
safe and efficient operation.
Transformer
Dry, non-flammable, and moisture-proof transformers installed in the nacelle platform
or inside the tower dominate offshore wind farm applications. These transformers have
a compact design, are vibration-resistant, and offer the highest reliability and efficiency.
Their robust construction makes them well-suited for the harsh marine environment, where
moisture and salt can pose significant challenges to electrical equipment. For extended
lifetime operations, it is crucial to assess the condition of transformers using appropriate
techniques. These include partial discharge tests, insulation resistance tests, and visual
inspections for locating bent connecting rods between taps and other connections. The
condition of the insulating system is the key life expectancy indicator for all transformers.
Over time, the structural strength and properties of dry transformer insulating materials
degrade due to factors such as thermal cycling, electrical stresses, and environmental
exposure. This degradation impacts their performance and reliability, potentially leading
to increased failure rates if not properly managed.
Substations
Wind farm substations are built to receive power generated by the OWTs through
cables. A typical wind farm substation consists of medium voltage systems, high voltage
systems, capacitor banks, control, protection and metering systems, communication sys-
tems, and fire and intruder protection systems. Common aging failure modes, such as
corrosion, wear, tear, and obsolescence, often occur in electrical systems and may apply
to the systems mentioned above. To assess the health status and estimate the RUL of the
different systems in a power substation for lifetime extension, a combination of visual
inspection, statistical methods, and laboratory testing is recommended.
4.1.2. Mechanical Subsystems
Rotor (hub)
The rotor of a wind turbine connects the blades to the main shaft and the rest of
the drivetrain system. It is typically made of welded steel or cast metal. During the
design phase, various load models and baseline analyses are conducted. To estimate
the RUL of an OWT hub, these models and analyses must be revalidated using updated
historical data from the OWT’s original design life. This data may include inspection,
maintenance, failure probability, and condition monitoring records. If loading models and
design analyses are unavailable, lifetime estimation information can be obtained through
expert elicitation. Despite the hub’s critical function, aging failure information is rare.
However, if failures occur, they can cause significant damage to the OWT, potentially
leading to its decommissioning before the end of its life. Potential aging failure modes
to consider during the extended life of rotor operations include broken or loose-mounted
bolts, corrosion fatigue of the hub structure, and degraded materials.
Blades
Wind turbine blades are the most challenging components to recycle due to their
large size, complex structure, and the materials used in their construction. The blades are
typically made from composite materials, such as fiberglass-reinforced epoxy or carbon
fiber, which are difficult to break down and separate into reusable components [83]. Most
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2024 ,17, 4191 15 of 33
OWT blades currently end up in landfills or are incinerated. Therefore, finding efficient
methods for extending the operational lifetime of OWT blades is crucial.
During the operational life of OWTs, blades are susceptible to various defects and
failures. Common blade defects and aging failure modes include cracks and delamination
of the composite material due to fatigue. Leading-edge erosion, caused by impact fatigue
from collisions with rain droplets, hailstones, or other airborne particles, is also a significant
issue for OWT blades. Blade failures can have significant economic consequences for wind
farm owners due to extended turbine downtime. Additionally, such failures can pose health
and safety risks, including potential injuries to the public. Therefore, ensuring the structural
integrity of blades is essential for extending the operational lifetime of OWTs. Verifying the
reliability of blades is crucial to achieving this lifetime extension. This verification ensures
that the blades can withstand specific site operational conditions, comply with relevant
safety standards, and avoid failures that could result in turbine downtime.
Assessing the condition of blades for lifetime extension should include analyzing
past operational and maintenance records to identify any damage incurred during the
original design life and determine if this damage could affect the blades’ structural integrity
during the extended operational phase. If high-quality data and design load models from
the blades’ design stages are available, the remaining fatigue life of the blades can be
estimated. In a study, Zhang et al. [ 84] analyzed the forces acting on OWT blades in
different environmental conditions and determined the relationship between the blades’
damage value and their remaining fatigue life. Bech et al. [ 85] studied the impact of leading-
edge erosion on the lifetime extension of OWT blades. They discovered that reducing the
tip speed of the blades during extreme precipitation events could significantly extend the
service life of the leading edges from just a few years to the entire operational lifecycle
of the OWT. Saathoff and Rosemeier [ 86] proposed an analysis method based on residual
stresses to assess the lifetime extension of a 1.5 MW wind turbine. They applied this method
to blade bolts and compared the results with those obtained using damage-equivalent
load calculations. More recently, Su and Kam [ 87] proposed a set of analytical methods to
verify the reliability of composite wind turbine blades after material aging due to external
environmental factors. They found that the blade’s reliability did not exceed 98% after
20 years. Therefore, it is crucial to enhance the blade structure to maintain high reliability
throughout the extended lifetime.
Gearbox
The gearbox is one of the most critical subsystems of OWTs. Although it is designed
to last for 20 years, it often begins to fail within seven years. Common aging failure modes
of a gearbox include damage to gear teeth and bearings through cracks. Other aging
failure modes, such as pitting and wear, can also occur during the lifetime extension phase
of operation. Gearbox failures are often linked to failures in the bearings. The lifetime
estimation of an OWT gearbox should be based on the analysis of condition monitoring
data obtained during the original design life. Additionally, lubricating oil analysis can help
asset managers determine if the oil contains contaminants such as sand, rust, grinding dust,
chips, splatter, and debris caused by wear and machining. These contaminants can lead
to gearbox failure through the pitting of bearing rollers. Therefore, using new lubricants
with improved properties could potentially reduce the damage and prolong the OWT
gearbox’s lifetime. In a research study, Qiu et al. [ 88] used ten minutes’ average wind speed
of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data to estimate the remaining
fatigue life of a wind turbine’s gear component under external and internal loadings. Junior
et al. [ 89] proposed a damage mechanics model based on finite element analysis (FEA)
to estimate the RUL of wind turbine gearboxes under severe service conditions, such as
angular misalignment and lack of lubrication. Olave et al. [ 90] provided a case study on the
lifetime extension of OWT pitch bearing and gearbox components. They concluded that
reducing noise emissions is an important requirement that needs to be considered for the
lifetime extension of gearboxes. Bill and Bill [ 91] developed an innovative particle-based
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2024 ,17, 4191 16 of 33
surface treatment technology to extend the lifetime of wind turbine gears and bearings.
Testing this technology on a grease-lubricated main bearing in a 1.5 MW wind turbine, they
observed significantly lower surface roughness, which ensured better load distribution,
lower local pressure, and reduced tribological stresses. Simulation results also indicated
that the probability of bearing failure significantly decreases, leading to a lifetime extension
of up to 17.3 years.
4.1.3. Power Control Systems
Pitch Control System
Regarding safety, the pitch control system is among the most critical components of
wind turbines. This system measures, monitors, and controls the working angle of the
rotor blades. The pitch control system consists of electrical components (pitch motor) and
mechanical components (pitch bearing and gears). Therefore, the lifetime estimation meth-
ods discussed for electrical and mechanical systems are applicable here as well. Common
aging failure modes for the pitch control system at the end of its original design life include
cracked motor shafts, fractured gear teeth, and cracked bearings. These potential failures
highlight the importance of thorough inspections and maintenance to ensure the continued
safe operation of the pitch control system.
Yaw System
The yaw system consists of active components such as the yaw drive and brakes, as
well as interfacing components like the yaw mesh, yaw bearing, and yaw brake disc. These
components are designed to last for the entire operational lifetime of OWTs. However,
they may suffer damage from various failure modes, such as cracks in the yaw drive
shaft, damaged gear teeth, pitting of the yaw bearing, and worn-out brake discs. Lifetime
estimation of the yaw system must be based on its functionality and the wear and tear of
its parts.
Sensors
Sensors play a critical role in improving the condition and performance of OWTs. The
data provided by sensors can be extremely valuable for wind farm operators, helping them
maximize energy output, minimize maintenance costs, and extend the operational lifetime
of their turbines. Sensors provide data about vibration levels, temperature, pressure,
operational loads, misalignments, and other critical parameters. This data helps identify
potential issues before they become serious problems, optimize maintenance schedules,
and assess the overall health of the OWTs. Using this data, wind farm managers can
make informed decisions about necessary repairs, adjustments, or upgrades, ultimately
enhancing the reliability and safety of OWTs during their extended operational life. Loraux
and Brühwiler [ 92] discussed how sensor data—including acceleration information, strain
measurements, and temperature readings—could be analyzed to assess the remaining
fatigue life of OWT components. In another work, Ziegler et al. [ 93] used load monitoring
data in the form of strain measurements to calculate the RUL and decide on the lifetime
extension of an 8MW OWT monopile structure.
Given that OWT sensors operate in environments with harsh conditions and potential
sources of interference, they may fail or provide incorrect readings. Sensor failures or
erroneous data can lead to inaccurate assessments of turbine health, increased risk of
undetected defects, and, ultimately, higher maintenance costs and reduced potential for
lifetime extension. Therefore, the suitability of sensors for the continuous operation of
OWTs beyond their original design life must be thoroughly evaluated. Lifetime assessment
of sensors can be achieved by benchmarking their data and analysis against data from
similar sensors operating in comparable environments to identify potential gaps.

Control and Monitoring Systems
Control and monitoring systems are prone to aging-related faults and may become
outdated. Upgrading control and monitoring systems is crucial for the lifetime extension of
OWTs. Implementing advanced control strategies can significantly reduce structural fatigue
loading and enhance the overall reliability of the OWT, ensuring efficient operation beyond
the original design life. Vali et al. [ 94] studied the impact of an active power control strategy
on the lifetime extension of a highly loaded OWT. They showed that the structural fatigue
loading of the OWT could be significantly reduced while maintaining wind farm power
production. In another work, Njiri et al. [ 95] proposed an online damage evaluation model
integrated with a variable gain multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) control strategy
to extend the lifetime of OWTs. Their results showed that the proposed prognostic-based
control strategy achieved a good balance between structural load reduction and extending
the RUL without causing any significant reduction in power production.
4.1.4. Structural Components
Main Frame
The main frame is a complex rigid steel casting/weldment structure located between
the nacelle and the yaw bearing. It supports mountings such as gearbox, generator, and
brake and is responsible for maintaining their proper alignment. Predicting the RUL of
the main frame requires a deep understanding of the principles of fatigue crack growth
(FCG), including crack initiation, crack propagation, and rupture in welded and bolted
joints. Fatigue crack failure, due to the combination of large and unstable crack propagation
caused by extreme loading, is the main aging failure mode of the main frame structure. Like
the tower and foundation, failure of the main frame during the lifetime extension phase of
operation can result in significant economic loss and potential injury to technicians.
Tower and Foundation
Tower and foundation are among the most critical components of OWTs because their
failure can result in the total collapse of the entire system. Fatigue cracks are the most
common aging failure modes experienced by OWT towers and foundations. Additionally,
OWT foundations suffer from scouring—a phenomenon where soil is eroded around
the foundation by water currents—and corrosion. The life assessment of OWT tower
and foundation structures can be conducted using either deterministic or probabilistic
models. While conventional S-N curves are commonly used during the design phase
to estimate the fatigue life of OWT structural components, they may be less suitable for
the lifetime extension phase. The S-N fatigue damage assessment provides only a rough
estimate of fatigue life and lacks a detailed view of the actual damage. In contrast, the
fracture mechanics approach, which utilizes damage accumulation models like Fatigue
Crack Growth (FCG), offers a more precise analysis by calculating and quantifying crack
growth over time under cyclic stress. The FCG method has several advantages over the
S-N approach, including its suitability for non-linear damage analysis. Additionally, it
supports the scheduling of inspection, repair, and maintenance activities during the lifetime
extension phase based on detailed damage information.
Recently, numerous studies have advocated for the use of FEA and fracture mechanics
approaches to estimate the remaining fatigue life of OWT structural components for life-
time extension. Ziegler and Muskulus [ 96] analyzed the suitability of numerical fatigue
assessment methods for extending the lifetime of a 5 MW OWT monopile foundation.
They calculated the residual fatigue lifetime of the monopile under various environmental,
structural, and operational conditions. Rubert [ 97], in his PhD thesis, presented a method-
ology for monitoring residual stresses in OWT foundation structures using optical sensor
networks. This approach aims to minimize conservative design assumptions and support
decision-making for OWT lifetime extension. Kazemi Amiri et al. [ 98] proposed an aeroelas-
tic FEA model to assess the remaining fatigue life of OWT tower structures, accounting for
stress concentration around the tower door and site-wide variations in wind characteristics.
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

Grieve et al. [ 99] proposed an aeroelastic model to estimate the operational loads on OWT
tower structures using actual SCADA data and then compared these results to design loads.
They utilized fatigue damage accumulation information to identify tower structures with
the greatest potential for lifetime extension across a large wind farm. Mitchell et al. [ 100]
proposed a probabilistic Bayesian network (BN) methodology and trained the algorithm
with inputs from design codes and standards to recalculate the fatigue life of an OWT
steel tower structure. The study concluded that applying the same partial safety factors
in the fatigue reassessment as those used in the original design would result in overly
conservative fatigue life estimations.
Geotechnical considerations play an important role in the lifetime extension of OWT
foundations. The OWT foundations must withstand various environmental forces, includ-
ing waves, currents, and wind loads, which can lead to significant stress and potential
degradation over time. Moreover, the type of seabed soil and its properties, such as den-
sity, shear strength, and compressibility, are crucial factors that affect the performance
and longevity of the OWT foundations. To effectively manage these issues during the
lifetime extension phase, detailed geotechnical surveys and assessments are necessary.
These should include the evaluation of current soil conditions, the extent of scouring,
and the degree of corrosion or other degradation in the foundation material. Advanced
geotechnical models and simulation tools can be employed to predict future changes in
the soil-structure interaction and to design appropriate mitigation measures, such as scour
protection systems or foundation reinforcement techniques. For further reading on the
geotechnical considerations in assessing the lifetime extension of OWT foundations, readers
can refer to reference [101].
4.2. Lifetime Extension Strategies for OWTs
Several strategies can be applied to extend the lifetime of OWTs, including retrofitting,
reconditioning, remanufacturing, reusing, and reclaiming. The following subsections
provide brief discussions of these key strategies.
4.2.1. Retrofitting
Retrofitting is a lifetime extension strategy aimed at enhancing the efficiency, capacity,
and reliability of OWTs by integrating new systems and technologies. This approach not
only addresses obsolescence issues but also improves the overall performance and reliability
of the turbines. By upgrading outdated components, wind farm operators can significantly
extend the operational lifetime of their OWTs, improve energy production efficiency, and
reduce maintenance costs. The major retrofitting activities for OWTs include installing
new components such as low voltage full power converters, upgrading control systems,
and reconditioning the generator to facilitate variable speed operation. This approach
enables old fixed-speed OWTs to operate at variable speeds during the lifetime extension
phase of operation. Countries like the UK, Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands are
pioneers in the retrofitting of wind turbines. These nations have implemented retrofitting
strategies to optimize the performance of aging wind turbines, aligning with advancements
in technology and industry standards.
4.2.2. Reconditioning
Reconditioning is the process of restoring old OWTs to a satisfactory functional con-
dition, albeit with performance outputs that may be lower than those specified by the
Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). This process involves thorough inspections,
repairs, and replacements of worn-out or outdated components to ensure OWTs continue
to operate efficiently. OWT subsystems that can be easily assembled and disassembled,
such as gearboxes, generators, and control systems, are ideal candidates for reconditioning.
These components can be restored to their original factory condition during the lifetime
extension phase of operation, providing a cost-effective alternative to complete replacement.
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2024 ,17, 4191 19 of 33
By adopting reconditioning practices, wind farm operators can ensure their OWTs continue
to generate power efficiently even as they age, thus maximizing their investment.
4.2.3. Remanufacturing
A remanufactured OWT is an old system that has been restored to OEM functional
specifications by replacing all key components with high-quality parts. The warranty for a
remanufactured OWT is equivalent to that of a new system. Remanufacturing OWTs offers
several advantages, including cost and workload reduction and retained profit through
lower production costs. Additionally, remanufacturing OWT components uses less material
and energy, leading to significant carbon savings compared to manufacturing new OWTs.
Remanufacturing has received increasing attention in recent years within the wind energy
industry. Ortegon et al. [ 102] introduced remanufacturing as an attractive lifetime extension
strategy for wind turbines. In another study, Dahane et al. [ 103] adopted a multi-agent
approach to evaluate how remanufacturing old gearboxes can contribute to extending the
operational life of OWTs.
4.2.4. Reusing
Reusing is a lifetime extension strategy that involves relocating old OWTs to a different
site once they reach the end of their original design life without making modifications to
their components. For instance, some components such as blades, generators, transformers,
towers, and gearboxes are often reused by wind farm owners in regions with growing
energy needs. This practice not only reduces costs but also promotes resource efficiency
and sustainability by extending the functional life of OWT components [ 104]. Reusing can
involve either full reuse of the entire OWT or partial reuse of specific components. Reports
indicate that the costs associated with this approach are lower compared to reconditioning,
remanufacturing, and retrofitting strategies [105].
4.2.5. Reclaiming
Reclaiming is a strategy that involves recovering, repurposing, or recycling compo-
nents and materials from decommissioned OWTs. In this strategy, key OWT components,
including blades, gearboxes, generators, transformers, and structural elements, are in-
spected and assessed for their condition. Usable materials such as metals (steel, aluminum,
and copper) are recovered. Some components or materials may be directly reused in other
turbines or repurposed for different industries or applications. For instance, composite
materials from blades can be utilized in the construction industry [ 106]. In some cases,
energy recovery methods are employed to extract and utilize the residual energy content
from certain materials, contributing to overall energy efficiency. Reclaiming not only helps
manage waste and conserve resources but also reduces the environmental footprint associ-
ated with OWTs. It supports a circular economy by ensuring that valuable materials and
components are recovered, repurposed, or recycled, thereby extending their lifecycle and
reducing the need for new manufacturing. This approach enhances the sustainability of
offshore wind energy projects by minimizing waste, conserving resources, and lowering
the demand for new raw materials.

5. Lifetime Extension Decision-Making for OWTs
This section introduces a cross-disciplinary approach to assist the offshore wind
energy industry in making informed decisions about extending the lifetime of OWTs.
As shown in Figure 3, this approach combines inputs from technical safety, economic,
environmental, and regulatory perspectives into a unified framework. It ensures that the
return on investment (ROI) is optimized while also addressing crucial safety considerations
during the lifetime extension phase of OWTs. The key tasks for each stage of the proposed
approach are detailed in the following subsections.

Extending the operational life of OWTs beyond their original design life requires 
more comprehensive and detailed informatio n than what was used during the design 
phase. To accurately assess the health status of OWT components and plan e ﬀectively for 
lifetime extension, it is crucial to update existing records with data collected throughout 
the wind farm’s operational life. This includes metocean data, design and modi ﬁcation 
records, environmental loading conditions, ﬁeld inspection and maintenance records, sen-
sor data from monitoring devices, operatio nal data, and economic data. Table 3 summa-

5.2. Subsystems/Components Screening and Prioritisation
As OWTs consist of numerous subsystems and components, assessing and upgrading
all parts of an OWT in a wind farm for lifetime extension is expensive, laborious, and
challenging. Therefore, technical, financial, and material resources must be allocated to
components whose failure could result in loss of life, significant property damage, envi-
ronmental damage, or extended downtimes. Analytical tools such as Cause-Consequence
Analysis (CCA), checklist analysis, Event Tree Analysis (ETA), Fault Tree Analysis (FTA),
HAZard and OPerability analysis (HAZOP), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA),
and what-if analysis are suitable for screening and prioritizing critical components of OWTs
for lifetime extension analysis.
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms for identi-
fying OWT components suitable for lifetime extension has gained significant momentum
in recent years. Some of the key ML techniques employed in this context include [107]:
Classification : This technique is used to categorize OWT components based on their
condition and predict whether they are suitable for lifetime extension. By training models
on historical data, classification algorithms can effectively distinguish between healthy and
deteriorating components.
Clustering : This technique groups similar components or operational conditions to-
gether, enabling the identification of patterns and common factors that may affect the
lifetime of OWT components. This can help to understand the underlying reasons for
component failures and optimize maintenance schedules.
Regression : This technique is used to predict the RUL of components based on various
operational and environmental factors. By modeling the relationship between these factors
and the degradation of components, regression algorithms can provide accurate estimates
of OWT reliability.
Time series analysis : This technique involves analyzing temporal data to understand
trends, seasonal effects, and long-term patterns in the performance and condition of OWT
components. Time series analysis can help to forecast future maintenance needs and plan
for lifetime extension activities.
Yeter et al. [ 108] reviewed the use of big data analytics, advanced signal processing
techniques, and supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods in the risk-
informed lifetime extension management of OWT support structures. In another study,
Yeter et al. [ 109] used an unsupervised k-means clustering algorithm to identify and
evaluate fixed-bottom OWTs across a wind farm for the purpose of lifetime extension.
This study combined structural integrity assessment, considering corrosion crack growth,
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2024 ,17, 4191 24 of 33
with economic analysis, accounting for the likelihood of estimated returns, to analyze the
feasibility of OWT lifetime extension.
5.3. Safety and Structural Integrity Assessments
This stage of the decision model focuses on safety and technical integrity issues
related to the lifetime extension of OWTs. The objective is to develop a component-level
model that analyzes the degradation of OWT components and evaluates their safety
and performance during the extended operational phase. Tartt et al. [ 110] provided a
comprehensive review of the lifetime extension practices for OWT drivetrain components.
In real-world applications, OWT components often suffer from multiple failure mechanisms
associated with a particular aging failure mode. Therefore, it is essential to identify all
failure mechanisms linked to a given failure mode and analyze the safety based on all
these factors. The safety assessment and structural integrity analysis models can be either
deterministic or probabilistic. Deterministic approaches focus on identifying various aging
failure modes and their underlying causes. On the other hand, probabilistic approaches
estimate the RUL of components or systems, incorporating the inherent uncertainties
in material properties, operational conditions, and environmental factors. Probabilistic
models offer a more comprehensive risk assessment by quantifying the likelihood of
different failure scenarios, thus enabling more informed decision-making regarding lifetime
extension. Various probabilistic models can be applied to estimate the RUL of OWT
components, including:
Statistical models : These models use historical data to predict future performance and
estimate the likelihood of failure during the OWT lifetime extension phase.
ML-based models : ML models analyze large datasets to identify patterns and predict
degradation trends during the OWT lifetime extension phase.
Physics-based models : These models use physical laws and principles to simulate the
behavior and degradation of OWT components over an extended lifetime.
Bayesian models : Bayesian approaches combine prior knowledge with new data to
update the RUL estimates of OWT components. To review the state-of-the-art Bayesian
models in wind energy, readers can refer to reference [111].
In addition to operational conditions, environmental conditions play a crucial role in
the RUL assessment of OWTs. To calculate loads and stresses during the lifetime extension
period, it is essential to gather comprehensive environmental condition data, including
average wind speeds, turbulence intensities, and extreme wind events [ 112]. If complete
data for the entire period is not available, long-term extrapolation may be performed
using other relevant data sets to ensure accurate assessments. Guo et al. [ 113] provided
a case study on predicting the RUL of OWTs in a wind farm in South China to aid in
the development of lifetime extension or decommissioning strategies. They gathered the
environment data of the OWT met mast and estimated the fatigue loads on the OWT based
on both the design load conditions and site-specific load conditions.
Additionally, in the case of a wind farm, wake effects must be considered in the struc-
tural integrity assessment of OWTs. Wake effects, caused by the turbulence generated
by upstream turbines, can significantly impact the loading conditions on downstream
turbines, leading to increased fatigue and potential degradation of components. Properly
accounting for both environmental and operational factors is vital for effective lifetime
extension strategies. In a research study, He et al. [ 114] studied the effects of various wake
conditions, including both full wakes and partial wakes, on the remaining fatigue life
of OWTs.
5.4. Economic, Environmental and Regulatory Assessments
Although technical assessment is a critical requirement for lifetime extension certifi-
cation, the economic, environmental, and regulatory impacts of OWT lifetime extension
projects must not be ignored. The economic assessment accounts for the total investment
cost required to implement the OWT lifetime extension project. To evaluate the economic
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2024 ,17, 4191 25 of 33
viability of OWT lifetime extension projects, the net-present value (NPV) approach is often
used. NPV calculations consider the projected costs and benefits over the extended oper-
ational period, discounting future cash flows to their present value. This method helps
determine whether the expected returns justify the investment in extending the OWT’s
lifetime. A major indicator for the economic viability of OWT lifetime extension projects is
the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). The LCOE represents the average cost per unit of
electricity generated over the lifetime of the OWT, including all capital, operational, and
maintenance costs. By calculating the LCOE, wind farm managers can assess whether ex-
tending the OWT’s lifetime will result in cost-competitive electricity production compared
to alternative EOL strategies such as repowering or decommissioning.
In a research study, Rubert et al. [ 115] analyzed the LCOE for a wind farm consisting
of six 900 kW wind turbines operating beyond their design lifetime to support economic
lifetime extension decision-making. Their results indicated that extending the lifetime
of the wind turbines could reduce the LCOE by 4.9% for a 5-year extension, 7.7% for a
10-year extension, and 9.3% for a 15-year extension. In two other research studies, Yeter
and Garbatov [ 116] and Yeter et al. [ 117] utilized Markowitz’s modern portfolio theory,
adapted from finance, to assess the economic added value of extending the lifetime of
OWTs by evaluating the increased returns from the overall wind farm assets and the
reduced risks associated with continued operation. They developed a multi-dimensional
optimization model, incorporating a detailed structural integrity analysis, free cash flow
analysis, probability of project failure, and both local and global economic constraints to
manage the lifetime extension process for OWTs.
In addition to economic factors, the environmental impact of extending the opera-
tional lifetime of OWTs must be carefully considered. This assessment should include
evaluating the potential benefits associated with reduced resource consumption and waste
generation compared to alternative EOL strategies such as repowering or decommissioning.
Extending the operational lifetime of OWTs can reduce the overall environmental footprint
associated with the manufacturing and installation of new turbines. However, it is also
crucial to evaluate any potential negative impacts of prolonging the OWTs’ presence in the
marine environment. This includes assessing how the extended operation may affect local
ecosystems, such as marine wildlife and habitats. Environmental assessments should also
explore potential issues such as changes in marine biodiversity, effects on fish populations,
and alterations to seabed conditions caused by the ongoing presence of the OWTs. For this
purpose, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methods can be particularly useful. LCA provides a
comprehensive evaluation of the environmental impacts associated with all stages of the
OWTs’ lifecycle, from construction and installation through to operation, maintenance, and
lifetime extension. By employing LCA, wind farm managers can make more informed
decisions about whether to extend the operational lifetime of OWTs or pursue alternative
EOL strategies.
Regulatory considerations are equally important. Extending the lifetime of OWTs
may require compliance with updated standards and regulations, which could involve
modifications to existing infrastructure or additional inspections and certifications. It
is crucial to stay informed about regulatory changes and ensure that all aspects of the
OWT lifetime extension project adhere to current legal requirements. By incorporating
the economic, environmental, and regulatory factors into the OWT lifetime extension
decision-making process, the offshore wind energy industry can develop more robust and
sustainable solutions.
5.5. Life Extension Decision Making
This stage involves making lifetime extension decisions for future operations based
on the safety and technical life assessments as well as the outcomes of the economic, envi-
ronmental, and regulatory analyses. The decision may include decommissioning the entire
wind farm, repowering the OWTs, or remanufacturing and retrofitting the OWTs for safe
and continuous operation. Choosing among these options involves a complex evaluation
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2024 ,17, 4191 26 of 33
process that considers various factors. The use of MCDM methods can be particularly
beneficial in this context. MCDM is a powerful tool that allows decision-makers to evaluate
various options by considering multiple criteria simultaneously, which is particularly useful
in complex and multifaceted decision-making processes. MCDM techniques help wind
farm managers systematically compare different EOL strategies by assessing them against
a set of predefined criteria. Boyd et al. [ 118] provided a comprehensive set of criteria worth
considering when deciding the most suitable solution for extending the lifetime of OWTs.
These criteria include economic factors (such as costs and financial returns), technical
considerations (such as the condition and performance of wind turbines), environmental
impacts (such as carbon footprint and ecological effects), and regulatory compliance.
Another tool that can be highly beneficial for the lifetime extension of OWTs is a
Decision Support System (DSS). A DSS is an advanced, multifaceted tool designed to aid
wind farm managers in evaluating and selecting the most effective strategies for extending
the operational lifetime of OWTs. This system integrates a diverse array of data sources,
analytical techniques, and decision-making frameworks to provide a holistic approach
to managing the complexities involved in OWT lifetime extension decision-making. One
of the key advantages of a DSS is its ability to evaluate different scenarios and strategies
under varying conditions. For instance, it can simulate the impact of different maintenance
schedules, upgrades, or environmental conditions on the OWT’s performance and lifetime.
Recently, some DSS tools have been developed to enhance the EOL management of OWTs.
These tools aim to address the complex challenges associated with decommissioning, re-
powering, or lifetime extension of OWTs, providing valuable support for making informed
and strategic decisions. As an example, DecomTools [ 119] is an initiative under the Interreg
North Sea Region Programme that focuses on developing and implementing tools and
strategies for the decommissioning of OWTs.

the operational lifetime of OWTs but also drive innovation in the wind energy industry,
improving sustainability, efficiency, and safety across the sector.
7. Conclusions
The high initial capital cost of constructing new offshore wind farms, compared to
the ongoing operation and maintenance (O&M) expenses, has created significant interest
in extending the operational licenses of OWTs beyond their original design life of 20–30
years. To secure these extensions, wind farm owners must demonstrate that their assets
can maintain safety and structural integrity throughout the extended operational period.
However, extending the operational lifetime of OWTs presents a variety of challenges that
must be carefully addressed. To effectively manage these challenges, the wind energy
industry can draw valuable lessons from other sectors with extensive experience in lifetime
extension. This paper presented insights gained from these industries and explored how
these lessons can be applied to the wind energy sector’s lifetime extension efforts. Addi-
tionally, it outlined the specific challenges that the wind energy industry is likely to face
during the lifetime extension phase.
The paper delved into the processes of lifetime estimation, the various aging failure
modes, and the appropriate strategies for extending the life of different OWT subsystems
and components. Based on the challenges identified, a decision-making framework was
proposed to support the lifetime extension of OWTs. This framework serves as a crucial
tool for evaluating and qualifying OWT subsystems and components for extended op-
erations. It incorporates safety and structural health assessments, as well as economic,
environmental, and regulatory considerations. Furthermore, the paper identified opportu-
nities that lifetime extension efforts can leverage to enhance the reliability, durability, and
safety of OWT systems while also improving the overall energy efficiency of wind farms.
From a technical standpoint, there is significant potential for technological innovation and
enhancement. Economically and socially, expanding the OWT remanufacturing market
could create new job opportunities. Finally, the paper emphasized the importance of
continued research into lifetime extension within the wind energy industry to deepen the
knowledge base of stakeholders and drive further advancements in the field. Addressing
the challenges associated with extending the lifetime of OWTs requires a coordinated and
comprehensive approach involving collaboration among various stakeholders, including
engineers, researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders. Effective communication with
stakeholders and transparent decision-making processes are essential to ensuring that
efforts are well-integrated, efficient, and widely supported.
