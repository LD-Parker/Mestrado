Abstract: This comprehensive review explores the application and impact of digital twin (DT) tech-
nology in bolstering the reliability of Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWTs) and their supporting
platforms. Within the burgeoning domain of offshore wind energy, this study contextualises the
need for heightened reliability measures in FOWTs and elucidates how DT technology serves as a
transformative tool to address these concerns. Analysing the existing scholarly literature, the review
encompasses insights into the historical reliability landscape, DT deployment methodologies, and
their influence on FOWT structures. Findings underscore the pivotal role of DT technology in enhanc-
ing FOWT reliability through real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance strategies, resulting
in improved operational efficiency and reduced downtime. Highlighting the significance of DT
technology as a potent mechanism for fortifying FOWT reliability, the review emphasises its potential
to foster a robust operational framework while acknowledging the necessity for continued research to
address technical intricacies and regulatory considerations in its integration within offshore wind en-
ergy systems. Challenges and opportunities related to the integration of DT technology in FOWTs are
thoroughly analysed, providing valuable insights into the role of DTs in optimising FOWT reliability
and performance, thereby offering a foundation for future research and industry implementation.

1. Introduction
The Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement are committed to reducing Earth’s
greenhouse gas emissions [ 1,2]. The commitment to reduce climate change effects and
global warming has led to the use of more renewable sources of energy. In the offshore
region, research and development are devoted to the use of offshore renewable energies,
which contribute to the achievement of several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by
providing clean and affordable energy (SDG 7) and fostering innovation and infrastructure
development (SDG 9). Among different types of renewable energies, wind technology is
one of the most mature sectors. Despite the considerable power capacity provided by fixed
wind platforms, the recent trend is towards bigger turbines to increase efficiency and the
deployment of floating structures [ 3,4]. According to the International Renewable Energy
Association (IRENA), the wind industry would need to be prepared for significant growth
in the wind market over the next three decades. Compared to onshore wind, higher growth
would be required in annual offshore wind capacity additions—around a ten-fold increase,
to 45 GW per year by 2050 from 4.5 GW added in 2018 [ 5]. By 2024, the Global Wind Energy
Council (GWEC) expects onshore wind to pass the 100 GW annual installations mark, while
offshore wind will install more than 25 GW in a single year for the first time in 2025 [6].

The expansive oceanic expanse presents favourable conditions for the development of
large-scale wind farms and turbines [ 7,8]. Offshore wind power benefits from faster wind
speeds, greater uniformity, and extended operational availability compared to onshore
counterparts [ 9–12]. While the upper tower components of an offshore wind turbine (OWT)
resemble their onshore counterparts, the primary distinction lies in the design of the lower
platforms [ 8,13]. These support structures for OWTs can be categorised into fixed and
floating types [ 14–16], with the selection dependent on factors such as water depth, soil
conditions, seabed characteristics, and environmental loads. Notably, the water depth
plays a pivotal role in the design process, with floating offshore wind technology gaining
prominence due to its capacity to access deeper waters, where wind resources are typically
more abundant, reaching depths of up to 1000 m [17,18].
The OWTs and their support platforms, as they near the end of their service lives,
typically possess structural integrity suitable for prolonged use, largely attributable to
conservative design principles and operational protocols. Consequently, the offshore wind
industry seeks a dependable certification framework to ensure that structural capacity
exceeds permissible limits throughout the desired extended service life, while minimising
operational costs [ 19]. Techno-economic analyses for lifecycle extension projects neces-
sitate the incorporation of various factors, including structural health monitoring data,
detailed structural integrity assessments, condition-based maintenance strategies, and
comprehensive financial analyses. To facilitate smart maintenance planning and predictive
maintenance for wind farm operations, the digital twin (DT) technique offers a valuable
approach. By mirroring the life of the corresponding physical twin through the utilisation
of advanced physical models, sensor updates, and other relevant data, DT enables more
effective and informed decision-making in the management of wind farm assets [20–22].
This review seeks to provide a comprehensive exploration of how DT technology
contributes to enhancing reliability in FOWTs. The foundation of our examination lies in
contextualising the reliability challenges specific to floating offshore wind, tracing the his-
torical evolution of reliability measures within the offshore wind sector, and subsequently
delving into the intricacies of DT technology as a tailored solution for addressing these
challenges. The results of our analysis will unveil the pivotal role played by DT technology
in real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and reliability analysis within the con-
text of FOWTs. Success stories and case studies will be examined to showcase instances
where DT implementations have led to tangible improvements in reliability, operational
efficiency, and overall performance. The subsequent sections of this paper delve into the
historical overview of offshore energy asset safety and reliability, DT applications in the
offshore wind industry, and challenges and opportunities associated with the integration
of DT technology in FOWTs, offering a comprehensive and insightful exploration of this
innovative approach.
2. Historical Overview of Offshore Energy Asset Safety and Reliability
The historical evolution of safety and reliability measures within the realm of offshore
energy assets is a journey marked by continuous innovation and adaptation. The quest
for robust safety protocols and reliable operational frameworks has been necessitated by
the inherent challenges posed by offshore environments, where harsh weather conditions,
complex engineering, and remote locations converge. This historical overview aims to
trace the trajectory of safety and reliability considerations in offshore energy, laying the
groundwork for understanding the contemporary landscape and the role of DT technology
in mitigating risks.
2.1. Developments in Offshore Energy
The genesis of offshore energy exploration can be linked to the mid-20th century, when
the pursuit of hydrocarbon resources led to the development of fixed-platform structures
in shallow waters [ 23,24]. These early structures laid the foundation for safety standards,
focusing primarily on structural integrity and fire prevention. Over subsequent decades,
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

as offshore activities expanded into deeper and more remote waters, the industry faced
heightened challenges. Tragic incidents, such as the Piper Alpha disaster in 1988 [ 25,26],
served as wake-up calls, prompting a re-evaluation of safety practices and the establishment
of regulatory frameworks.
The 1990s witnessed a paradigm shift in safety thinking, transitioning from a fo-
cus solely on hardware integrity to a holistic approach encompassing human factors,
organisational culture, and risk management [ 27,28]. International standards such as the
International Safety Management (ISM) Code were introduced [ 29,30], emphasising a sys-
tematic approach to safety management. This period also saw the emergence of advanced
technologies for asset monitoring and risk assessment, setting the stage for a more proactive
safety culture [31].
2.2. Offshore Wind Energy
In the 21st century, as the offshore energy sector diversified to include renewable
sources like offshore wind [ 32–35], safety and reliability considerations evolved to encom-
pass a broader spectrum of challenges. Offshore wind farms introduced novel structural
configurations and operational dynamics, necessitating adaptations in safety protocols.
The Deepwater Horizon incident in 2010 [ 36,37] highlighted the ongoing need for vigilance
and spurred further advancements in safety technologies and regulatory oversight.
Offshore wind turbine structures represent a pioneering frontier in renewable energy,
harnessing the power of wind over vast expanses of the ocean to generate clean and sus-
tainable electricity [ 8,10,11,14,15,18,21]. These structures, typically consisting of towering
masts anchored to the seabed, support massive turbine blades that capture wind energy
and convert it into electricity through rotational motion. Engineered to withstand the harsh
marine environment, offshore wind turbine structures feature robust designs capable of
enduring high winds, turbulent seas, and corrosive saltwater. As a key component of
offshore wind farms, these structures are strategically located in coastal waters to maximise
wind resources and minimise visual impact on land. The OWT structure is comprised of
several essential components, including the foundation, tower, nacelle, and rotor assembly.
A towering structure is typically made of steel or concrete, which supports the nacelle and
rotor assembly. The nacelle houses the turbine’s mechanical components, including the
gearbox, generator, and control systems, while the rotor assembly comprises the blades
and hub responsible for capturing wind energy. As for the foundations of OWTs, there are
two primary types: fixed and floating foundations [ 4,21,38,39]. Figure 1 shows the main
types of OWT foundations by different installation methods [8].

 2.1. Developments in O ﬀshore Energy 
The genesis of o ﬀshore energy exploration can be linked to the mid-20th century, 
when the pursuit of hydrocarbon re sources led to the development of ﬁxed-platform 
structures in shallow waters [23,24]. These ea rly structures laid the foundation for safety 
standards, focusing primarily on structural integrity and ﬁre prevention. Over subsequent 
decades, as o ﬀshore activities expanded into deeper and more remote waters, the industry 
faced heightened challenges. Tragic incidents,  such as the Piper Alpha disaster in 1988 
[25,26], served as wake-up calls, prompting a re-evaluation of safety practices and the es-tablishment of regulatory frameworks. 
The 1990s witnessed a paradigm shift in safety thinking, transitioning from a focus 
solely on hardware integrity to a holistic approach encompassing human factors, organi-sational culture, and risk management [27,28]. International standards such as the Inter-
national Safety Management (ISM) Code were  introduced [29,30], emphasising a system-
atic approach to safety management. This period also saw the emergence of advanced 
technologies for asset monitoring and risk assessment, se tting the stage for a more proac-
tive safety culture [31]. 
2.2. Oﬀshore Wind Energy 
In the 21st century, as the o ﬀshore energy sector diversi ﬁed to include renewable 
sources like o ﬀshore wind [32–35], safety and reliability considerations evolved to encom-
pass a broader spectrum of challenges. O ﬀshore wind farms introduced novel structural 
conﬁgurations and operational dynamics, necessita ting adaptations in safety protocols. 
The Deepwater Horizon incident in 2010 [36, 37] highlighted the ongoing need for vigi-
lance and spurred further advancements in safe ty technologies and regulatory oversight. 
Oﬀshore wind turbine structures represent a pioneering frontier in renewable en-
ergy, harnessing the power of wind over vast expanses of the ocean to generate clean and 
sustainable electricity [8,10,11,14,15,18,21]. Th ese structures, typically consisting of tower-
ing masts anchored to the seabed, support ma ssive turbine blades that capture wind en-
ergy and convert it into electricity through ro tational motion. Engineered to withstand the 
harsh marine environment, o ﬀshore wind turbine structures feature robust designs capa-
ble of enduring high winds, turbulent seas, and corrosive saltwater. As a key component 
of oﬀshore wind farms, these structures are stra tegically located in coastal waters to max-
imise wind resources and minimise visual impact on land. The OWT structure is com-
prised of several essential components, including the foundation, tower, nacelle, and rotor 
assembly. A towering structure is typically made of steel or concrete, which supports the nacelle and rotor assembly. The nacelle houses the turbine’s mechanical components, in-
cluding the gearbox, generator, and control systems, while the rotor assembly comprises 
the blades and hub responsible for capturing wind energy. As for the foundations of 
OWTs, there are two primary types: ﬁxed and ﬂoating foundations [4,21,38,39]. Figure 1 
shows the main types of OWT foundations by di ﬀerent installation methods [8]. 
 
Figure 1. Types of OWT platforms: ( a) monopile, ( b) gravity-based platform, ( c) jacket, ( d) tripod,
(e) tripole, ( f) spar, ( g,h) tension-legged platform, and ( i) semi-submersible. Reproduced from [ 8],

Fixed foundations, such as monopiles or jackets, are anchored directly to the seabed,
providing stability and support for the turbine. These fixed foundations are suitable for
shallow to moderate water depths and relatively stable seabed conditions. On the other

hand, floating foundations are designed for deeper waters where fixed foundations are
not feasible. Floating foundations utilise buoyant structures that are moored to the seabed
using tethers or anchors, allowing the turbine to remain stable while floating on the water’s
surface. These foundations enable the deployment of offshore wind turbines in deeper
waters, expanding the potential sites for wind energy development.
A semi-submersible platform consists of buoyant pontoons or columns submerged
below the waterline, which provide stability and buoyancy to the platform. The plat-
form is partially submerged, with only a portion of the structure visible above the water
surface. This design allows the platform to remain stable in rough sea conditions while
providing a secure foundation for OWTs. The semi-submersible platform is often used in
deepwater locations where fixed-bottom foundations are not feasible, offering flexibility
and scalability for offshore wind energy projects [ 8,16,38]. Engineering applications of
semi-submersible platforms include the WindFloat platforms by Principle Power, Saitec’s
SATH (Swinging Around Twin Hull) platforms, BW Ideol’s Damping Pool floating founda-
tion, the OC4-DeepCwind platform, and the W2Power Platform [ 39]. In addition to the
semi-submersible platform, Spar and tension leg platforms (TLP) are also used in offshore
wind projects [4,11,18].
The loads acting on the foundation of OWTs primarily include vertical loads from
the weight of the turbine components, horizontal loads from wind and waves [ 40], and
moments resulting from the dynamic behaviour of the structure. As the historical landscape
unfolds, it becomes evident that safety and reliability in offshore energy have been shaped
by a continuous dialogue between industry experiences, technological innovations, and
regulatory responses [29–31,41–44].
2.3. Reliability Methods
In structural design, the reliability of a structural component is assessed concerning
one or more limit states. The structure is characterised by a set of fundamental variables,
denoted as X, which encompass its strength, stiffness, geometry, and loading, among
other factors.
The failure probability can be expressed using the probability integral over the
failure set:
PF=Z
G(X)≤0fX(X)dX (1)
where G(X) is the limit-state function for the failure mode considered, and fX(X) is the joint
probability density function for X.
The complement 1—P Fis accordingly referred to as the reliability of the structural
component in question. The corresponding reliability index is determined by
β=−Φ−1(PF) (2)
where Φis the standard normal distribution function.
The failure probability and reliability index can be determined using various reliability
methods, which may include the first- and second-order reliability methods, i.e., FORM
and SORM [ 45–48], as well as simulation methods. Analytical methods have an advantage
in that they typically do not require significant computer resources. However, they may
not provide exact results for the probabilities sought but rather approximations that may
not always be accurate enough. The first step in these methods involves transforming the
physical basic variables into a space of standard normal variables. This transformation leads
to a corresponding limit-state surface in the standard normal space, replacing the limit-state
surface of basic variables. The analytical methods for solving failure probability rely on
approximations of the limit-state surface in the standard normal space by operational
surfaces. These operational surfaces allow for the computation of the corresponding failure
probability according to the probability integral defined above.
When dealing with larger failure probabilities, it is recommended to use simulation
methods. Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) techniques are a useful tool for estimating failure
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2024 ,17, 1964 5 of 23
probabilities [ 49–52]. One advantage of these methods is their simplicity, as they are easy to
understand and execute. Additionally, when a sufficient number of simulations are carried
out, the solutions provided by these methods converge towards exact results. However,
one drawback is that these methods require a lot of computation time, particularly when
estimating small failure probabilities with good confidence. It has been noted [ 53] that
for simulations employing indicator-based Monte Carlo methods, a minimum of 100/P F
simulation samples is required, where P Frepresents the failure probability.
In addition to the previously mentioned, widely utilised reliability analysis methods,
the partial safety factor (PSF) specified in design standards is often aligned with target
reliability, especially when the probability of failure is not explicitly computed [ 54,55]. In
the first-order second-moment (FOSM) method, two parameters (mean and variance) are
typically employed to characterise each uncertain variable [ 40,56]. The response surface
method (RSM) is also an efficient and widely applicable method in structural reliability
analysis, in which typical first- or second-order polynomials are chosen to replace the real
limit-state function [57,58].
2.4. Discussion on Recent Developments
Recently, there has been an increasing trend in the utilisation of artificial intelligence
(AI), machine learning (ML), and DT technologies to enhance reliability in engineering ap-
plications [ 8,59–62]. AI and ML algorithms offer powerful tools for analysing large datasets,
identifying patterns, and making predictive assessments, thereby enabling more accurate
risk assessments and proactive maintenance strategies. These technologies can leverage
real-time data from sensors and monitoring systems to detect anomalies, predict equipment
failures, and optimise operational performance. Additionally, DT technology has gained
prominence for creating virtual replicas of physical assets, facilitating simulation-based
reliability analysis, and enabling condition-based monitoring and maintenance. In the
offshore wind sector, AI, ML, and DT are increasingly being integrated into asset manage-
ment systems to improve reliability, reduce downtime, and enhance overall operational
efficiency. In [ 60], artificial neural network (ANN) models were used for limit-state function
approximation and combined with MCS and FORM for reliability assessment.
Incorporating structural health monitoring (SHM) and condition monitoring (CM)
techniques into reliability assessments presents a significant advancement in ensuring
the integrity and performance of engineering assets. By continuously monitoring the
structural health and operational conditions of components in real time, SHM and CM
provide invaluable data for assessing the reliability of critical systems. More specifically,
SHM systems installed on offshore wind turbine structures continuously monitor struc-
tural integrity, detecting any signs of fatigue, corrosion, or damage that may compromise
reliability. Similarly, CM technologies track the operational performance of critical compo-
nents such as gearboxes, bearings, and blades, identifying potential faults or inefficiencies
early on. By integrating SHM and CM data into reliability analyses, offshore wind farm
operators can better predict component failures, optimise maintenance schedules, and
minimise downtime.
3. Advances in DT Development for FOWTs
By learning from past incidents and evolving safety practices, the offshore wind
industry is better poised to integrate DT solutions effectively, ensuring a resilient and
secure future for offshore energy assets. The overview in this section sets the stage for the
subsequent exploration of DT technology’s application in enhancing safety and reliability
within offshore energy assets, providing valuable insights into the evolution of safety
practices and the imperative for continuous improvement in the face of dynamic challenges.
3.1. Introduction to DT
A DT can be defined as a virtual representation of a system or asset that calculates
system states and makes system information available, through integrated models and

data, to provide decision support over its life cycle. The idea of using a twin model can
be dated back to NASA’s Apollo program in the 1970s, where two identical space vehicles
were built to allow mirroring of the conditions of the space vehicle during the mission [ 63].
While initially proposed in 1991, the DT made its debut in 2002 within the realm of product
lifecycle management (PLM). Originally dubbed the mirrored spaces model (MSM) and
information mirroring model (IMM), it was officially named Digital Twin in 2011 [64].
DT technology has found widespread applications across various industries, including
aerospace [ 65], automotive [ 66], healthcare [ 67], manufacturing [ 68], and smart city [ 69]
industries, etc. Initial applications of DTs are evident in NASA’s spacecraft and US Air
Force jet fighters [ 70,71]. Major vendors like Siemens, PTC, and Dassault Syst èmes have
incorporated DT concepts into their PLM systems. The DT model has also been proposed
to support the resilient implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT) [ 72]. Companies like
TESLA are actively pursuing the development of DTs for all manufactured cars, facilitating
synchronous data transmission between vehicles and the production facility. Between 2017
and 2019, Gartner, a prominent technology research and advisory company, included DT
technology among the top 10 strategic trends. Their prediction foresaw that within 5 years,
billions of objects would be represented by DTs [73].
While the concept of DT is not novel, initially, it remained largely descriptive and
lacked auxiliary technologies in its early stages [ 74–76]. Figure 2 illustrates the surge
in research interest in the DT concept, evident from the increasing amount of findings
acquired through searching the topic ‘digital twin’ in the database of Web of Science (WoS).
Especially since 2019, there has been a notable surge in interest from both industry and
academia, as reflected in the increasing number of results obtained. According to data
from WoS, China emerges as the leading country in DT publications, followed by the USA,
Germany, Italy, the UK, and South Korea, among others, indicating global recognition and
engagement with this evolving field.

3.2. DT for Offshore Wind
The DT concept comprises three key components: (1) the physical asset itself, (2) its
virtual representation, and (3) the interconnectedness between these two components.
This connection encompasses the seamless exchange of information from the physical
asset to its DT, and vice versa [ 77,78]. In more recent developments, an expanded five-
dimensional DT model has emerged to address the evolving needs of various applications
for Industry 4.0 [ 79]. This enhanced model builds upon the foundational concept of DTs by
incorporating additional dimensions for data and services.

the virtual model, the data and services, and the transmissions between the DT components.
The DT-enabling technologies include sensing technology, modelling technology, the data

The integration of sensing technology is crucial for enabling physical objects to per-
ceive and interact with the external environmen t. Once data have been collected, adjust-
ments to the virtual model are necessary to accurately re ﬂect changes in physical entities. 
This comprehensive approach requires the virtual model to encompass a wide array of features, including geometric, physical, behavioural, and rule-based information. Given 
the vast amount of data generated during the operation of physical objects, big data ana-
lytics technologies are indispensable for e ﬀectively collecting, transmi tting, storing, and 
processing this information. Additionally, the functionality of DT services is dependent 
on the speci ﬁc usage of the physical object, necessitating the implementation of data trans-

environment-coupling technology is essential for considering the impact of environmental
factors on the DT model.
A DT for the power converter of offshore wind turbines was introduced in [ 81] with
the aim of forecasting damage accumulation and estimating the remaining useful life (RUL).
This DT model takes into consideration medium- and short-term thermal transient loadings,
as well as long-term thermal loading. Figure 4 illustrates the 5 MW NREL wind turbine
and the corresponding numerical turbine utilised within the virtual space framework of the
DT. The details of the data and information transmission are revealed in the next section.

the impact of environmental factors on the DT model.  
A DT for the power converter of o ﬀshore wind turbines was introduced in [81] with 
the aim of forecasting damage accumulation and estimating the remaining useful life 
(RUL). This DT model takes into considerat ion medium- and short-term thermal transient 
loadings, as well as long-term thermal loading. Figure 4 illustrates the 5 MW NREL wind 
turbine and the corresponding numerical turb ine utilised within the virtual space frame-
work of the DT. The details of the data and information transmission are revealed in the next section.

3.3. Data Acquisition and Integration 
Data acquisition and integration play pivotal roles in the development and imple-
mentation of DT technology. E ﬀective data acquisition is essential for capturing real-
world information and transforming it into ac tionable insights. This involves collecting 
data from various sources, including sensors,  IoT devices, historical records, and opera-
tional systems. With the proliferation of Io T devices and sensors in industrial environ-
ments, there is an abundance of data available for DT applications. Advanced data acqui-
sition techniques such as edge computing and cloud-based data platforms enable real-time data processing and analysis, facilitating timely decision-making and predictive 
maintenance.  
In the examination of the aforementioned  5 MW NREL virtual wind turbine [81], 
wind and ambient pro ﬁles were imported from supervisory control and data acquisition 
(SCADA) data. Subsequently, the loading pro ﬁle was integrated into FAST (now 
OpenFAST) [11,12] or similar aero-elastic-servo-control models to generate inputs (e.g., 
torque and speed) for the generator. Within the DT framework, virtual sensors were gen-
erated for structural locations without strain gauges, utilising a blend of aeroelastic mod-
els and ﬁnite element methods (FEM). Power loss was estimated based on the power val-
ues obtained from SCADA data. Python programming was utilised to forecast the junc-tion temperatures of insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBT) and diodes, in conjunction 
with overall junction temperature prediction. 
However, the challenge lies in identifying relevant data sources, ensuring data qual-
ity, and establishing secure and e ﬃcient data transmission ch annels. The integration of 
disparate data sources is critical for creating a comprehensive DT ecosystem. This involves harmonising data formats, protocols, and st andards to enable seamless interoperability

parate data sources is critical for creating a comprehensive DT ecosystem. This involves
harmonising data formats, protocols, and standards to enable seamless interoperability
across different systems and domains. Integration efforts may encompass data from multi-
ple sources, including engineering design tools, simulation software, enterprise resource
planning (ERP) systems, and supply chain management platforms. By integrating data
from various sources, organisations can gain a holistic view of their assets and operations,
enabling better-informed decision-making and the optimisation of processes. Additionally,
data integration enables the creation of digital threads that link various stages of the product
lifecycle, including the phases of design, manufacturing, operation, and maintenance.
Enhanced alignment with data formats is deemed essential for the industry, facilitat-

integration platforms are adept at handling various formats, direct comparisons of data,
such as through conducting trend analyses over time, are often hindered by the disparate

such as READI (REquirement Asset Digital lifecycle Information) [ 83] and PDEF (Pipeline

focusing on standardising data formats.
In summary, the diversity of data formats poses a challenge to data integration efforts.
While data integration platforms are capable of handling different formats, the direct
comparison of data, particularly for trend analysis over time, is hindered by these format
disparities. This challenge becomes more pronounced when operators switch service
providers, as each may have distinct data requirements defined in contracts. Aligning
these data requirements across service providers and assets is crucial but entails both time
and cost.
3.4. Modelling and Simulation
Modelling encompasses the process of creating virtual replicas or models of physical
assets, capturing their structural, operational, and environmental characteristics. In the
case of FOWT platforms, modelling involves integrating data on turbine components,

digital representation. Various modelling techniques, ranging from finite element analysis
(FEA) to computational fluid dynamics (CFD), are employed to simulate the behaviour
of offshore energy assets under different operating conditions, loading scenarios, and
environmental forces.
Qi et al. [ 86] categorised the typical tools for applications of DT services into four
main groups, (1) platform tools, (2) simulation, (3) optimisation, and (4) diagnostic and
prognosis service tools, which are summarised in Figure 6. For example, the commercial
software ANSYS Twin Builder, built upon the ANSYS simulation platform, empowers users
to develop highly accurate virtual replicas of physical assets, enabling real-time monitoring,
predictive analytics, and performance optimisation. With its seamless integration with
other ANSYS tools such as ANSYS Fluent, ANSYS Mechanical, and ANSYS SCADE, users

individually to validate the assumptions of the FE models. The entire system underwent in
situ testing at the Open Jet Facility wind tunnel in Delft.
Simulation using the DT model involves running computational experiments or sce-
narios to predict the performance and response of the physical asset. Through simulation,
engineers can assess the structural integrity, dynamic behaviour, and operational efficiency
of FOWT platforms, identifying potential failure modes, optimising design parameters,
and evaluating risk mitigation strategies. Advanced simulation tools enable real-time
interaction with the DT, allowing operators to monitor asset health, predict maintenance
needs, and make informed decisions to enhance reliability and safety [74–76,80,86,88].
Akselos’ reduced basis FE analysis (RB-FEA) technology is claimed to be faster than
conventional FEA methods, boasting higher accuracy by leveraging posterior accuracy
indicators and automated model enrichment processes [ 88]. The reduced basis (RB) method
stands as a technique for creating reduced-order models of parametrised partial differen-

tial equations (PDE), necessitating the definition of a geometric domain (e.g., established
by a mesh with different elements), a specific physics type, boundary conditions, and
a model parameter (e.g., material properties) vector. In RB-FEA, the RB method is ap-
plied to the interiors of components, while a transfer eigenvalue technique, known as
“optimal modes”, is employed for DOF reduction on component interfaces. In the con-
text of a detailed DT for a floating platform, the RB-FEA model typically ranges from
approximately 10,000 to 500,000 DOF , representing a reduction of around 1000 when com-
pared to the DOFs in an equivalent FE model [ 89]. Akselos’ predictive DT technology
has catalysed numerous wind foundation design projects in collaboration with industry
leaders such as BEPA, Det Norske Veritas (DNV), Lamprell, ABS, Shell, and various other
companies [89–93].
Furthermore, the integration of modelling and simulation with data-driven approaches,
such as ML [ 94–97] and AI [ 98–100], enhances the predictive capabilities of DTs. By
analysing vast amounts of operational data and historical performance metrics, ML algo-
rithms can identify patterns, predict potential failures, and optimise asset performance
in real time. This synergistic combination of modelling, simulation, and data analytics
offers a holistic approach to ensuring the safety, reliability, and sustainability of offshore
energy assets.
4. Application of DT on Safety and Reliability
The impact of DT technology on safety and reliability within the offshore energy sector
is profound, revolutionising traditional approaches to asset management and maintenance
practices. By creating virtual replicas of physical assets and continuously updating them
with real-time data from sensors and monitoring systems, DTs provide operators with
unprecedented visibility into asset health and performance. This real-time monitoring
capability enables the early detection of potential failures, allowing operators to implement
proactive maintenance interventions before issues escalate, thus enhancing overall safety
and reliability. Ultimately, the impact of DT technology on safety and reliability in the
offshore energy sector is transformative, driving continuous improvement and innovation
in offshore operations.
4.1. Real-Time Monitoring and Predictive Analytics
Real-time monitoring is a cornerstone of DT technology, enabling operators to capture
and analyse live data from sensors embedded throughout offshore energy assets. These
sensors collect a plethora of information, including structural health metrics, environmental
conditions, operational parameters, and performance indicators. By integrating this real-
time data into the DT framework, operators gain immediate insights into asset performance,
allowing them to detect anomalies, identify potential issues, and take proactive measures
to ensure safety and reliability.
Leveraging the GE Predix platform as a foundation, GE developed a digital wind farm
infrastructure, incorporating a DT for each wind turbine (see Figure 7). The platform is
accomplished by varying the tower height, the rotor diameter, and the nameplate. This
innovative approach aims to optimise maintenance strategies, enhance reliability, and
boost energy production within wind farms. By harnessing the power of DT technology,
operators gain unprecedented insight into the operational health and performance of
each turbine, enabling proactive maintenance interventions, maximising reliability, and
optimising energy output [86,101,102].

Furthermore, predictive analytics leverages historical data, ML algorithms, and ad-
vanced analytics techniques to forecast fu ture behaviour and performance trends of o ﬀ-
shore energy assets. By analysing pa tterns and correlations within the data, predictive 
analytics models can anticipate potential failures, predict maintenance needs, and opti-mise asset performance. For example, ML algo rithms can identify early warning signs of 
equipment degradation or impending failures based on historical failure pa tterns and op-
erational data, enabling operators to interv ene before catastrophic events occur.

DTs empower operators with data-driven decision-making capabilities, enabling 
them to make informed choices regarding a sset maintenance, optimisation, and risk mit-

predict near-future mooring line tension, achieving promising results with an error margin

A probabilistic framework was introduced in [ 107] for enhancing the structural relia-

Depending on the scheduled lifetime extens ion, one can store structural response 
data or environmental data, or both, with higher-quality data leading to more precise es-
timates. Operational data are compared to pr edicted data generated by numerical models 
used in the design phase, with signi ﬁcant diﬀerences prompting model updates to be tter 
reﬂect the real structure. Updated uncertainties are then compared to initial assumptions, 
forming the basis for updating structural reliability. This process establishes a consistent 
reliability level for a given structure, with reduced uncertainties leading to an estimation 
of excess reliability used to extend the struct ure’s lifetime. Excess reliability is translated 
into extended lifetime through probabilistic models, predicting when reliability reaches 
its target value due to deterioration mechanis ms like fatigue. Extending the monitoring

Xia and Zhou [110] conducted a recent comprehensive review of the latest advance-
ments in DT technology, focused on optimising the operation and maintenance (O&M) of 
oﬀshore wind farms (OWF). The review covered various aspects such as failure analysis, 
O&M objectives, strategies, and optimisation models, as well as the development and 
management of DT technology in the contex t of O&M. Furthermore, a novel DT-based 
optimisation framework tailored for OWF O&M was introduced, aiming to enhance op-erational e ﬃciency and intelligence levels. 
In addition, a method to quantify the value of a DT was proposed in [110]. It was 
suggested that the value of a DT could be assessed by considering the collective value of 
each wind turbine component’s DT. This is quanti ﬁed by the following equation: 
V=Δ V
r+Δ V c+Δ  V s+Δ V e (3) 
where V is the DT’s value, ΔVr signi ﬁes the reliability utility variation, ΔVc means the 
O&M cost variation, ΔVs reﬂects the variation in the security utility, and ΔVe represents 
the variation in terms of environmental protection. 
The value of each sub-DT ca n be partitioned into the sum of the value of the corre-
sponding monitoring system, of the data stor age and processing system, and of the digital 
model construction.

ments in DT technology, focused on optimising the operation and maintenance (O&M) of
offshore wind farms (OWF). The review covered various aspects such as failure analysis,
O&M objectives, strategies, and optimisation models, as well as the development and
management of DT technology in the context of O&M. Furthermore, a novel DT-based opti-
misation framework tailored for OWF O&M was introduced, aiming to enhance operational
efficiency and intelligence levels.
In addition, a method to quantify the value of a DT was proposed in [ 110]. It was
suggested that the value of a DT could be assessed by considering the collective value of
each wind turbine component’s DT. This is quantified by the following equation:
V=∆Vr+∆Vc+∆Vs+∆Ve (3)
where V is the DT’s value, ∆Vr signifies the reliability utility variation, ∆Vc means the
O&M cost variation, ∆Vs reflects the variation in the security utility, and ∆Ve represents
the variation in terms of environmental protection.
The value of each sub-DT can be partitioned into the sum of the value of the corre-
sponding monitoring system, of the data storage and processing system, and of the digital
model construction.
Six requirements were outlined in [ 111] for implementing DT technology in the fatigue
monitoring of bolted ring-flanges on OWT support structures, considering the broader
context of the DT paradigm within the OWT industry. While each requirement addresses
specific needs in the OWT context, they may also have applicability to other industries.
The summarised requirements are as follows:
(1) A well-defined objective for the DT to meaningfully support engineering decisions.
(2) Strategically designed observations, considering associated costs.
(3) Resolution of boundary conditions subject to parametric variability or uncertainty to
allow the reconstruction of structural loads.
(4) A simulator or surrogate model enabling uncertainty propagation in near real-time,
feasible with desktop computational resources.
(5) Updatability of the simulator form and parameters based on observations of the
physical system.

(6) Interpretability of the simulation model, with a preference for physics-informed
simulators.
While the outlined requirements provide a structured approach to implementing
DT technology in fatigue monitoring, their practical use may be influenced by various
limitations such as resource constraints, data quality, computational feasibility, and the
balance between complexity and interpretability.
5. Challenges and Future Directions
The challenge of conducting reliability analysis, health monitoring, and predictive
maintenance for FOWTs persists because of their high O&M costs [ 8]. It was noted in [ 110]
that the majority of current studies concentrate solely on monitoring certain components
of OWFs, lacking systematic monitoring strategies for the entire facility. Existing DT
models often exhibit poor performance, characterised by inadequate fidelity, attributed
to incomplete data, sluggish data processing, and insufficient model integration. In this
regard, investigating systematic monitoring, non-contact monitoring techniques, rapid data
processing techniques, and model integration will be pivotal for the successful deployment
of DT technology in OWFs.
A practical scheme for transferring data from the physical to the virtual space has
been established, addressing data interconnection between the two realms. However, the
absence of virtual-to-physical feedback, essential for the DT-informed decision-making
process, is notable in the literature [ 112]. Moreover, while numerous studies on DT have
been proposed, many remain conceptual or focus solely on subsystem development. A
comprehensive, integrated framework for creating and applying DTs appears to be lacking.
Challenges and future directions in DT technology for offshore wind present a dynamic
landscape shaped by both technological advancements and industry-specific complexities.
Despite significant progress, several hurdles remain, necessitating innovative solutions and
strategic focus.
Table 1 outlines the challenges encountered in DT applications for enhancing the relia-
bility of FOWTs within the offshore wind industry, along with corresponding suggestions
or comments for addressing each challenge. One of the foremost challenges lies in data
integration and management. Offshore wind farms generate vast amounts of data from
various sensors and monitoring systems, posing challenges in data collection, storage, and
processing [ 113,114]. Ensuring the seamless integration of this diverse data into DT models
remains critical for accurate and reliable performance monitoring and predictive analytics.

Another key challenge is model fidelity and validation. DT models must accurately
represent the complex behaviour of offshore wind assets, including dynamic environ-
mental conditions, structural loads, and system interactions [ 115]. Building high-fidelity
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

models entails a foundation in FEA [ 15,87,88,120,121] and CFD [ 16,122,123], alongside the
incorporation of innovative data-driven methodologies [ 94–100], all of which necessitate
continuous validation against real-world data, thereby posing computational and analytical
challenges [116].
Furthermore, interoperability and standardisation are essential for scaling DT solu-
tions across the offshore wind industry. Establishing common data formats, communication
protocols, and interoperable platforms will facilitate seamless collaboration and data ex-
change among stakeholders, ultimately enhancing efficiency and innovation. Additionally,
concerns arise regarding the safeguarding of physical and virtual infrastructure against
cyber-attacks [ 117,118], as well as potential social ramifications stemming from widespread
DT applications in the future [119].
Looking ahead, future directions in DT for offshore wind will likely focus on enhancing
predictive capabilities, enabling proactive maintenance and optimisation strategies. While
the focus on enhancing predictive capabilities and enabling proactive maintenance and
optimisation strategies is paramount, it is essential to address the inherent complexities and
uncertainties within offshore wind operations. One significant challenge lies in the dynamic
and harsh offshore environment, where unpredictable factors such as extreme weather
conditions and environmental degradation can significantly impact asset performance
and reliability. Therefore, developing robust predictive models that account for these
uncertainties and accurately forecast equipment failures is crucial for effective maintenance
planning and risk mitigation. Advanced analytics, ML, and AI will play a crucial role
in developing predictive models capable of forecasting equipment failures, optimising
performance, and maximising energy production.
Additionally, there is a growing emphasis on DT applications for holistic asset lifecycle
management, spanning design, construction, operation, and decommissioning phases.
Integrating DTs into a unified lifecycle management framework will enable comprehensive
decision support and facilitate data-driven strategies for optimising asset performance and
longevity. This approach requires the seamless integration of DTs into a unified lifecycle
management framework, which presents technical and organisational challenges. Ensuring
interoperability between various DT systems and data sources, as well as establishing
standardised protocols for data exchange and analysis, will be essential for realising the full
potential of DT in optimising asset performance and longevity. Furthermore, overcoming
barriers related to data privacy, security, and ownership rights will be crucial for fostering
collaboration and knowledge sharing across stakeholders in the offshore wind industry.
6. Summary
Amidst the ongoing digitalisation trend, the digital twin has emerged as powerful
technology, with discussions spanning various industries, including offshore wind energy.
The advent of DTs offers an effective avenue for achieving remote monitoring and control,
predicting downtime, and mitigating risks for FOWTs. This paper delves into the recent
literature concerning the myriad applications of DTs for the offshore wind industry, pro-
viding valuable insights into the role of DTs in optimising the reliability and performance
of FOWTs.
Despite challenges associated with DT implementation in FOWTs, including data
integration, data quality assurance, real-time modelling, and cybersecurity concerns, the
potential benefits outweigh the obstacles. To harness the full potential of DT in offshore
wind, several recommendations emerge.
(1) First and foremost, there is a critical need to unify data and model standards, along
with the development of universal platforms and tools. This standardisation will
facilitate seamless data exchange and interoperability among different stakeholders
and systems within the offshore wind sector.
(2) Additionally, the establishment of an accessible database for data and model sharing
is essential to promote collaboration, transparency, and innovation across the industry.

(3) Furthermore, thorough examinations of data quality and dedicated validation cam-
paigns are imperative to ensure the accuracy and reliability of DT models. Integrating
IoT technologies and leveraging ROM techniques will enhance the efficiency and
scalability of DT applications.
(4) Investing in computational infrastructure, including fog, cloud, and edge computing,
will provide the necessary computational power to support real-time analytics and
decision-making processes.
(5) Finally, advanced cyber-security protocols need to be implemented to safeguard DT
systems and data from potential cyber threats, ensuring the integrity and confiden-
tiality of sensitive information in the offshore wind environment. By embracing
these recommendations, the offshore wind industry can unlock the transformative
potential of DT technology, driving innovation, efficiency, and sustainability in wind
energy operations.
As the offshore wind sector continues to evolve, embracing DT technology will offer a
pathway to optimise reliability, mitigate risks, and drive innovation in FOWT operations
and maintenance practices. Through collaborative efforts and strategic investments, the
realisation of reliable and sustainable offshore wind energy is becoming increasingly
attainable with the aid of digital twin solutions.
While efforts were made to provide a comprehensive overview, it should be noted that
not every aspect of FOWT reliability enhancement or digital twin application may have
been covered within the review’s scope. Further research is encouraged to delve deeper
into specific limitations and future directions in this rapidly evolving field.
