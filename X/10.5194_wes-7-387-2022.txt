Abstract. This paper presents the state-of-the-art technologies and development trends of wind turbine driv-
etrains – the system that converts kinetic energy of the wind to electrical energy – in different stages of their
life cycle: design, manufacturing, installation, operation, lifetime extension, decommissioning and recycling.
Offshore development and digitalization are also a focal point in this study. Drivetrain in this context includes
the whole power conversion system: main bearing, shafts, gearbox, generator and power converter. The main
aim of this article is to review the drivetrain technology development as well as to identify future challenges
and research gaps. The main challenges in drivetrain research identiﬁed in this paper include drivetrain dynamic
responses in large or ﬂoating turbines, aerodynamic and farm control effects, use of rare-earth material in gener-
ators, improving reliability through prognostics, and use of advances in digitalization. These challenges illustrate
the multidisciplinary aspect of wind turbine drivetrains, which emphasizes the need for more interdisciplinary
research and collaboration.

1 Introduction
The European Green Deal aims to make the European Union
climate-neutral by 2050, with land-based and offshore wind
being an important part to meet this target (EU, 2019b). The
European Union has been at the forefront of wind energy
technology development in recent years, especially offshore;
European companies represent an impressive 90 % of the off-
shore global market (EU, 2019a). There is a special focus
on offshore wind development in the EU Clean Energy for
All Europeans package, in which 30 % of the future electric-
ity demand, approximately 450 GW, is expected to be sup-
plied by offshore wind (EU, 2019a) – a huge increase from
today’s 20 GW of installed capacity (Wind Europe, 2020).
In the United States, it has been estimated that wind can
supply 35 % of the US electricity demand by 2050, with
86 GW installed offshore (DOE, 2015). Moving from land-
based to offshore turbines has also opened possibilities of
increasing the size and power of the wind turbine and plant.
Deeper-water locations offshore have also been used by ﬂoat-
ing turbines, with the ﬁrst ﬂoating wind plant in operation
since 2017. Such fascinating developments are challenging
the technological borders and existing knowledge base of the
industry. There is limited experience with such huge machin-
ery in harsh environmental conditions, so the best practices
and standards have not yet fully matured.
The drivetrain converts mechanical power to electrical
power and transmits the rotor loads to the bedplate and tower.
The drivetrain in this context includes the entire power con-
version system from the main bearing to the electrical gener-
ator and power conversion system. The two main drivetrain
conﬁgurations and components that characterize them are de-
picted in Fig. 1. A variety of wind turbine drivetrain tech-
nologies are available, with pros and cons for each in terms
of cost, weight, size, manufacturing, materials, efﬁciency, re-
liability, and operation and maintenance (O&M) (Polinder
et al., 2006; Arabian-Hoseynabadi et al., 2010; Moghadam
and Nejad, 2020; Harzendorf, 2021; Harzendorf et al., 2021).
With digitalization expanding in all industries, new opportu-
nities have arisen in the operation phase, including digital
O&M and digital twins. As the age of the installed ﬂeet con-
tinues to increase, considerations for lifetime extension and
decommissioning are also becoming more important.
This study reviews the state of the art of the drivetrain
technology in the wind turbine industry and discusses fu-
ture development trends. The focus is on conventional and
widely used concepts; unconventional designs, such as hy-
drostatic (Silva et al., 2014) and hydraulic designs, are not
discussed. To achieve the aims of this paper, a life cycle ap-
proach (Torsvik et al., 2018), as illustrated in Fig. 2, is em-
ployed. First, the design – and, to a limited extent, manufac-
turing – is discussed. It is followed by drivetrain operation
– in particular, condition and performance monitoring – and,
ﬁnally, lifetime extension, decommissioning and recycling.

conﬁgurations, with and without a gearbox (illustration by Amir
Nejad).
2 Design trends and developments
The technological drivers for the drivetrain are not neces-
sarily the same as other elements of the wind turbine. For
instance, for towers there are site-speciﬁc solutions that de-
pend on wind conditions or other site characteristics, which
affect the cost considerably. However for the drivetrain, the
number and size of components are cost drivers, not the site-
or region-speciﬁc characteristics. It is possible to design the
drivetrain with respect to logistic costs, for example a mod-
ular design that can be handled by a smaller or tower-top
crane, reducing transportation, installation and replacement
costs for offshore wind turbines, although such technology
is still under development. In terms of availability of future
drivetrain designs, the development trend is in not only the
quality and manufacturing but also the service and opera-
tional monitoring.
A compact, lightweight drivetrain is the most cost-
effective option for large offshore wind turbines because it
reduces the nacelle mass and hence tower and foundation
or ﬂoating platform masses and costs. To achieve these re-
ductions, there has been a trend toward increasing the me-
chanical integration of the main bearing, gearbox and gener-
ator (Stehouwer and van Zinderen, 2016; Demtröder et al.,
2019; Nejad and Torsvik, 2021; Reisch, 2021; Zeichfüßl
et al., 2021; Weber and Hansen, 2021). In terms of the
power conversion system, permanent magnet synchronous
generators (PMSGs) with full-power converter systems are
becoming more common than doubly fed induction gener-
ators (DFIGs) with partial-power-converter systems. Con-
cerns over the supply of rare-earth materials typically used in
PMSGs have also spurred interest in alternate generator tech-
nologies, such as superconducting generators (Veers et al.,
2020). Regardless of drivetrain design choice, the loads and
operational conditions that the drivetrain is subjected to are
derived from the design load cases described in the Inter-
Wind Energ. Sci., 7, 387–411, 2022 https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-7-387-2022

61400-3-2 design standards for offshore ﬁxed and ﬂoating
wind applications.
2.1 Main bearing
Current commercially available main bearing designs use
rolling-element bearings (Hart et al., 2020). Spherical roller
bearings are utilized in a signiﬁcant proportion of currently
operational main bearings, with usage of this technology
likely to continue (to a greater or lesser extent) in sub-
5 MW machines. Tapered roller bearing designs are now
also common at these power levels. For larger wind tur-
bines (5 MW), however, the industry has very much con-
verged on tapered roller main bearing technology (Chovan
and Fierro, 2021). Because of the large applied nontorque
loads, the resulting bearing designs are likewise large in di-
ameter, limited in size only by manufacturing and transporta-
tion restrictions. Continued use of rolling-element bearings
is likely because it is a familiar technology, albeit with de-
sign trends moving outside the envelope of prior experience.
A central driver behind the move to large-diameter rolling-
element bearing arrangements is the need for cost-effective
rotor support solutions. Other existing bearing technologies
– such as hydrostatic, air and magnetic bearings – tend to re-
quire very rigid support structures or are limited to smaller
diameters than would be required by modern wind turbines,
although hybrid solutions combining different technologies
have been proposed (Shrestha et al., 2010). Given the con-tinued increases in main bearing diameter, understanding the
effects of deﬂections in large-diameter rolling-element bear-
ings is essential, and the current practice of assessing bear-
ing design life through only the conventional calculation
methods in the International Organization for Standardiza-
tion (ISO) standards 76 and 281 and technical speciﬁcation
(TS) 16281 might be insufﬁcient with respect to the resulting
service life observed in operation.
Main bearings have been shown to experience repeating,
large-scale ﬂuctuations in load, even during normal opera-
tion (Hart, 2020). These ﬂuctuations likely increase the risk
of other damaging mechanisms (such as roller skidding, sur-
face fatigue, wear and abrasion) not accounted for in fatigue-
life calculations. As such, the analysis of the operating condi-
tions of these components has further indicated that current
life-assessment standards might be insufﬁcient. Main bear-
ing failure rates of up to 30 % during a 20-year design life
have also been reported (Hart et al., 2019). Further work is
therefore needed to identify principal drivers of main bear-
ing failures, allowing for the development of appropriate de-
sign standards and best practice speciﬁc to this component,
which, in turn, will lead to improvements in reliability. Guo
et al. (2021) investigated one possible driver of main bearing
failures, that of axial motion between rollers and raceways.
It has previously been hypothesized that such motions may
compromise the lubricant ﬁlm which separates bearing inter-
nal surfaces, leading to increased levels of friction and wear.
However, from analysis of both ﬁeld measurements and an-
alytical model outputs it was concluded that axial velocities

390 A. R. Nejad et al.: Wind turbine drivetrain technology
are too small to have any signiﬁcant inﬂuence on lubricant
ﬁlm formation (Guo et al., 2021).
Modern offshore wind plants are high-value assets, and
there is an increasing interest in longer design life and life-
time extension. Turbine size and drivetrain arrangement can,
however, result in main bearing replacement becoming more
difﬁcult and expensive, generally requiring removal of the
rotor. Consequently, main bearings will increasingly be re-
garded as part of the load-carrying structure, with cost im-
plications of failure more severe as a result. A further ram-
iﬁcation of increased levels of integration is that main bear-
ing operational requirements become linked to those of other
components. For example, in addition to supporting the tur-
bine rotor, some direct-drive conﬁgurations require the main
bearing to also support the generator rotor while maintaining
an appropriate generator air gap. Coupled approaches to the
modeling and assessment of wind turbine drivetrain systems
will therefore become increasingly important.
Novel main bearing design concepts are also being devel-
oped and tested. Loriemi et al. (2021) propose the use of
asymmetric spherical roller bearings to improve main bear-
ing internal load sharing during operation. Finite-element
modeling was used to compare a standard and asymmetrical
design, with results indicating signiﬁcant improvements for
the latter with respect to both main bearing fatigue life and
isolation of the gearbox from transferred axial loads. Plain
bearing (equivalently, journal bearing) technology is also be-
ing considered in this space. More speciﬁcally, a segmented
plain bearing with conical sliding surfaces is being developed
as a main bearing solution for wind turbines (Rolink et al.,
2020, 2021). Sliding segments are connected to the housing
via doubly ﬂexible supports to maintain their alignment with
the tilting shaft and prevent edge loading. A major advantage
of this design is that the sliding segments are individually re-
placeable uptower without requiring drivetrain disassembly.
Other main bearing concepts utilizing this same technology
have also been explored (Rolink et al., 2020).
With respect to materials, chill-cast nodular cast iron
(GJS) has been investigated as a possible alternative to
forged steel for manufacture of the rotor-shaft and main bear-
ing seat (Kirsch and Kyling, 2021). Chill-cast GJS enables
lightweight construction through freedom of design while
also providing appropriately robust mechanical properties.
Lighter and smaller hollow rotor-shaft designs may become
feasible as a result. This, in turn, would have implications
for main bearing design and selection. Cost reductions may
therefore be possible through design optimization of GJS
components, but resulting shaft–bearing systems can have
reduced stiffnesses, which may lead to inner ring creep or
fretting fatigue (Kirsch and Kyling, 2021). Work in this area
is ongoing.2.2 Gearbox
Wind turbine gearboxes continue to increase in size (up to
3 m in diameter) and power (up to 15 MW) (Vaes et al.,
2021). With multistage gearboxes using four or more plan-
ets per stage, torque densities of 200 N m kg 1and speed-
increasing ratios up to 200 are now available (Daners and
Nickel, 2021). These increasingly ﬂexible systems require
detailed modeling to understand the effect of deformations
and dynamics on internal loading (Wang et al., 2020). To
achieve further cost reductions through economies of scale,
modular gearbox designs have been introduced (Windpower,
2021). Gearboxes are designed for a minimum of a 20-year
life, as speciﬁed in the IEC 61400-4 and American Gear
Manufacturers Association (AGMA) 6006 gearbox design
standards. Provisions for uptower service or replacement of
gearbox components are becoming more common and are
required for components that have a design life less than the
gearbox. The gearbox system comprises many elements (pri-
marily the rotating shafts, gears and bearings), so the relia-
bility of the gearbox is the product of the reliability of all
the failure modes for which there exists a reliability calcula-
tion as described in Verband Deutscher Maschinen- und An-
lagenbau 23904 and IEC Technical Speciﬁcation 61400-4-1.
But many, if not most, of the failure modes experienced in
operation do not have a standardized reliability calculation;
hence, as described earlier, there exists a difference between
the apparent reliability observed in operation and the calcu-
lated design reference reliability. This is not unusual, and it
occurs in other industries, although the O&M cost impact for
wind turbines can be more severe. For gearboxes, the relia-
bility calculation considers gear tooth surface durability (pit-
ting) according to ISO 6336-2 and bending strength accord-
ing to ISO 6336-3, rolling-element bearing rating life from
subsurface-initiated fatigue (i.e., rolling contact fatigue) ac-
cording to ISO 281 and ISO/TS 16281, and shaft fatigue
fracture according to Deutsches Institut für Normung 743
and American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/AGMA
6001. In some cases, a safety factor for or percentage risk
of these failure modes can at least be quantiﬁed in the gear-
box design process, including gear tooth scufﬁng according
to ISO/TS 6336-20, ANSI/AGMA 925 and ISO/TS 6336-21
and gear tooth micropitting according to ISO/TS 6336-22,
or otherwise assessed for gear tooth ﬂank fracture according
to ISO/TS 6336-4. Safety factors for the static strength of
gears and bearings are calculated according to ISO 6336 and
ISO 76, respectively. Other bearing failure modes, such as
surface-initiated fatigue (e.g., micropitting), adhesive wear,
corrosion, electrical damage and white-etching cracks, can
only be assessed qualitatively. Requirements for materials,
processing and manufacture are part of these standards. Fur-
ther in-depth contact and ﬁnite-element analysis are used
to design the microgeometry of these rotating components,
provide additional rating life calculations (Morales-Espejel
and Gabelli, 2017) and analyze the supporting housing struc-

tures. In addition to classical reliability approaches, use of
structural reliability methods for reliability analysis of gears
has also been investigated (Nejad et al., 2014a; Dong et al.,
2020). Design guidance for the use of plain bearings in the
gearbox is under development because they offer advantages
in terms of torque density and are life-limited only by wear
rather than determined by load-dependent rolling contact fa-
tigue, although they are already becoming common in new
gearboxes (Weber and Hansen, 2021; Zeichfüßl et al., 2021).
Surface engineering, lubricants and lubrication of the gear-
box also play an essential role in gearbox design, operation
and reliability (Dhanola and Garg, 2020; Jensen et al., 2021).
2.3 Generator
As highlighted earlier, wind turbine drivetrains can be ei-
ther geared or direct-drive generator systems (Polinder et al.,
2013). The geared generator system can be further divided
into either a DFIG with a partial-power converter or a brush-
less generator with a full-power-converter (GFPC) system.
The DFIG system has been the most popular topology for
medium-sized turbines ranging from 3–6 MW. The GFPC
system uses either a squirrel cage induction generator or a
PMSG. Many manufacturers now provide commercial GFPC
solutions at power levels up to 10 MW (Siemens, 2020;
ABB, 2020). In terms of direct-drive systems, rare-earth
PMSGs are appealing for offshore applications. The main-
stream power level is from 5–7 MW, but the top power level
has kept increasing during the past 2 decades.
The stator elements of DFIGs and PMSGs are largely the
same. The major difference in terms of the electrical machine
hardware is the rotor design and the means – or lack thereof
– of getting current onto and off the rotor. These differences
can impact both efﬁciency and failure mechanisms and their
rates. In terms of efﬁciency, induction generators use a set of
currents on the rotor to produce the rotor magnetic ﬁeld. This
leads to joule rotor losses and hence a decrease in efﬁciency.
In contrast, a PMSG uses rare-earth permanent magnets to
produce the rotor magnetic ﬁeld, hence avoiding further joule
losses.
In terms of failure types, a DFIG uses carbon brushes and
slip rings to conduct the currents between the rotor and the
stator. The brushes typically wear out over time and need fre-
quent inspection and replacement. The PMSG avoids those
elements. There are also differences in reliability because of
the presence of conductor and insulation systems (DFIG) and
magnet materials (PMSG), but those are not yet clear. A com-
parative study of DFIGs and PMSGs showed that during the
early life, a PMSG has a failure rate 40 % lower than that of
a comparable DFIG (Carroll et al., 2014).
Alongside this variation in the reliability of different elec-
trical machine architectures, there is variation in the relia-
bility caused by the torque rating of the generator. This was
ﬁrst shown by Spinato et al. (2009). For example, it is possi-
ble to conceive of two wind turbines that both use the samegenerator type, but one is in a geared conﬁguration (with a
gearbox ratio of 100), and the other is direct-drive. For the
same wind turbine rotor (and subsequent power and rota-
tional speed), the torque rating of the direct-drive genera-
tor will be 100 times more than that of the geared generator.
Assuming that the same electromagnetic shear stress is pro-
duced by the two generators, the volume of the direct-drive
generator will also be 100 times that of the higher-speed gen-
erator. If they have the same ratio of diameter to axial length,
then the generator diameter will be 3p
100 (i.e.,4:64) that
of the geared machine. The electromagnetic materials are ap-
proximately proportional to the surface area of the rotor and
stator. In the case of the low-speed machine, this might be
4:642(i.e., 21.5) times that of the higher-speed machine.
With more poles, more coils, longer conductors and insula-
tion, it is likely that the failure rate is higher in direct-drive
machines if there is no improvement in failure rate intensity.
These variations in generator failure rate should be taken into
consideration – along with the gearbox failures discussed in
Sect. 2.2 – when assessing failure rates of different types of
geared and non-geared drivetrains.
The reliability and availability of the wind generator sys-
tem have a decisive impact on the cost of energy (COE), es-
pecially offshore (Carroll, 2016; Shipurkar et al., 2016). The
generator design should consider the interactions with other
components to improve the system reliability of the drive-
train (Moghadam and Nejad, 2020). In large wind turbines,
multiphase windings with modular converters can be used to
improve the generator system availability (Shipurkar et al.,
2015; McDonald and Jimmy, 2016).
Upscaling is still a continuing trend for both land-based
and offshore wind turbines because a higher-power wind
turbine system leads to a lower levelized cost of energy
(LCOE) (Sieros et al., 2012). For land-based wind, recent
developments include the design of 6 and 8 MW turbines,
which will be on the market in the near future, whereas
offshore commercial applications now aim for 10–15 MW,
and research is going beyond 15 MW (Gaertner et al., 2020;
Ashuri et al., 2016; Sartori et al., 2018). Upscaling brings
many challenges, including large generator weight, high
manufacturing and installation difﬁculties and cost, compli-
cated electromechanical dynamics, and complexity of sys-
tem monitoring. A systematic design approach will be re-
quired for the design of the generator, where cooling and ef-
ﬁciency will be among the challenges in higher-power sys-
tems. Depending on the type, nominal power, shaft speed,
the speciﬁc electric loading and subsequently the armature
thermal loading, three general solutions – namely, air–air,
air–water and water jackets – are commercially available to
implement the cooling system of a wind generator (Polikar-
pova, 2014). Signiﬁcant cost savings can be realized with the
development of a more effective stator winding cooling sys-
tem that further limits the current density to enable the de-
velopment of higher-power PMSGs of substantially smaller

diameters while not adversely affecting the electromagnetic
performance of the generator.
Multiphase, modular designs are solutions to tackle some
of the challenges, and they have been used in commercial
systems (Yaramasu et al., 2015; McDonald and Bhuiyan,
2016). Concerns over the availability of rare-earth elements –
such as neodymium, praseodymium and dysprosium – typi-
cally used in PMSGs have led the wind industry and other in-
dustries to develop innovative technologies to reduce, substi-
tute for or entirely eliminate their need for generators (Veers
et al., 2020). This also results in technologies that are lighter
than PMSGs. Breakthroughs in superconducting materials
could change the scenario of materials and upscaling com-
pletely (Hoang et al., 2018) by eliminating rare earths and
enabling further generator weight reductions, with several
superconducting generators successfully tested (Frank et al.,
2003; Bergen et al., 2019) or in development (Moore, 2020).
The interactions between the generator and power elec-
tronics can bring issues including bearing currents, addi-
tional stress in insulation because of overvoltage in transients
and high-voltage slew rates (Chen et al., 2020); therefore,
these interactions should be studied and modeled not only for
the design but also for O&M. Proper ﬁlters and control meth-
ods should be integrated according to the generator types
and power electronics topologies. For the upscaling of wind
generators, various modular and multilevel power converter
topologies feeding multiphase windings will be a promising
solution. But attention should be paid to circulating current
and potential asymmetric supplies to avoid risks (Yaramasu
et al., 2015).
2.4 Power converter
Being between the generator and power grid, the power con-
verter needs to fulﬁll the requirements for both sides (Blaab-
jerg et al., 2011). Wind turbine power converters used to have
a topology as shown in Fig. 3a, where the generator-side con-
verter is a diode rectiﬁer cascaded with a boost converter
to maintain a stable direct current (DC) link voltage; then
a two-level inverter is employed on the grid side to ensure
full control of the grid current injection (e.g., total harmonic
distortion and power factor). This topology has a relatively
low cost because of fewer power switches than newer con-
ﬁgurations, so it is widely used for generators in small- to
medium-sized wind turbines. For megawatt-scale generators,
however, the low-frequency torque pulsation and high total
harmonic distortion become very harmful to the generator.
As a result, the design of the boost converter becomes very
challenging, and therefore the front end is then replaced by a
two-level, six-switch converter with power factor correction,
which is shown in Fig. 3b and is called a back-to-back (BTB)
converter. A DFIG with a partially loaded BTB converter is
commonly used for generators less than 3 MW, whereas a
PMSG with a fully loaded BTB converter is commonly used
for generators greater than 3 MW.When the power rating is 10 MW or more, a single two-
level BTB converter is no longer suitable because the cur-
rent stress of the power devices would be extremely high.
For two-level BTB converters, the grid-side voltage is typi-
cally 690 V . To solve this, multiple two-level BTB converters
can be connected in parallel to share the current, whereas the
connection of the generator side can be slightly different de-
pending on whether the generator has a multiwinding (see
Fig. 4a). Another way to upscale the power rating is to in-
crease it to medium voltage, for instance, by a neutral-point-
clamped (NPC) converter (see Fig. 4b) or a modular multi-
level converter.
Other crucial topics for power converters include thermal
loading and grid integration. Intermittent winds create tem-
perature swings in power converters, which are the main fac-
tor of power converter aging. The possibility of applying
lithium-ion battery energy storage systems to smooth wind
power has been investigated to reduce this aging (Qin et al.,
2013). The approach is effective, and the stress mitigation
performance is affected by the energy and power rating of the
energy storage system; however, the energy storage system’s
high cost is still the main barrier preventing its widespread
application. Variable switching frequencies can also some-
what reduce temperature swings (Qin et al., 2015b), which
is an attractive option as a control approach that does not
add hardware cost. Nonetheless, the grid ﬁlter design to han-
dle the variable switching frequency might be challenging. A
promising approach can be the use of the kinetic energy in the
wind turbine’s rotor as energy storage by the rotating speed
control to suppress the power ﬂuctuation in the power con-
verter and thereby reduce the temperature swings (Qin et al.,
2015a). Another topic that is trending for the wind power
converter is grid integration. Grid-following mode control
was applied in the grid-side converter, and it is still main-
stream; however, as wind power penetration is increasing, the
grid is becoming relatively weak (low short-circuit ratio, low
inertia, etc.). Grid-supporting mode control can cause power
quality issues and even grid failures in some severe cases
(Larumbe et al., 2018, 2019). Energy storage systems or syn-
chronous condensers can be associated with wind plants to
provide inertia and to reduce the burden of the grid with-
out grid reinforcement (which is very expensive), but these
components are still expensive. Another promising approach
is to apply grid-forming mode control to the grid-side wind
power converter so the inertia in the wind turbines can be
used to support the grid and enhance grid stability and reli-
ability. Grid-forming control is a group of controllers with
which the wind power converters not only get the grid cur-
rent controlled, but also support the grid voltage, frequency
or inertia. Typical grid-forming control includes droop con-
trol, in which the active and reactive power injected to the
grid is reacting to the grid frequency and voltage, and virtual
synchronous machine control, in which the inertia of the syn-
chronous machine is mocked in the wind power converter.

There is a trend in power electronics to evolve from
silicon-based power semiconductors to wide-bandgap de-
vices (e.g., silicon-carbide devices). This will have a positive
impact on wind energy systems because it can improve the
power density and improve the efﬁciency of the power con-
verters (Erdman et al., 2015). In the meantime, it also brings
challenges to wind generators because of the high-voltage
slew rate as a result of fast switching. Proper ﬁltering andoscillation-damping technologies should be used to mitigate
the side effects, such as common-mode current and insula-
tion degradation.
The type of cooling system chosen for the converter de-
pends on the nominal power and voltage, power density
and thermal design, and generator technology, which can be
based on either air or direct or indirect liquid cooling (Zhou

the converter for high-power applications ( >5 MW) can be
signiﬁcantly reduced.
3 Modeling and analysis
Wind turbine drivetrains are subject to dynamic loading from
a wide range of operating conditions caused by wind shear,
veer, turbulence, and gusts; changes in the turbine opera-
tional state; grid faults; and nacelle motions; therefore, it
is essential that the computational models for the drivetrain
consider the dynamics of the rotor and the demands of the
grid through the converter. Such an electromechanical model
captures the aeroelastic interactions of the rotor and charac-
terizes the voltage and current excursions in the generator
because of grid requirements (Gallego-Calderon et al., 2017;
Bruce et al., 2015; Blockmans et al., 2013).
Given the complex contact mechanics, one of the most
challenging aspects of simulating wind turbine gearboxes
is modeling the meshing gear teeth and supporting bear-
ings. With their computational efﬁciency, lumped-parameter
methods have been the method of choice for modeling gears
and bearings in system-level, ﬂexible, multibody systems.
In this approach, a pair of meshing gears is simpliﬁed into
a pair of rotating cylinders with constant inertias that are
interconnected by a (nonlinear and/or time-varying) spring
along the line of action or contact. Analogously, in lumped-
parameter bearing modeling, the contact of the rolling el-
ements with the inner and outer bearing raceways is de-
scribed in terms of nonlinear springs. For meshing gear teeth,
the tooth stiffness changes periodically as the number of
teeth in contact and the contact locations along the active
tooth ﬂanks change throughout the gear rotation, whereas
for rolling-element bearings, the stiffnesses vary with the
magnitude and the location of the rolling-element contact
loads. The various lumped-parameter models differ primar-
ily in the way the contact is computed. One of the oldest
but most complete approaches for modeling the interactions
between contact surfaces is the classic contact theory by
Hertz and its derivatives (Johnson, 1987). Hertzian contact
theory is valid (i) when the contact area is sufﬁciently far
from the boundaries of the contacting bodies, allowing them
to be treated as elastic half spaces, and (ii) when the elas-
tic deformation of the body is conﬁned to the contact zone.
These assumptions have proven to be particularly valid ap-
proximations in bearing analysis, where the direct applica-
tion of Hertzian contact theory has led to computationally ef-
ﬁcient and accurate three-dimensional ball bearings (De Mul
et al., 1989a; Lim and Singh, 1990). For gears, however, the
Hertzian assumptions are not consistent with the compar-
atively large bending, compressive and shear deformations
that are typically encountered in meshing gears. Lumped-
parameter gear modeling techniques are therefore typically
formulated using mesh stiffnesses that are obtained through
empirical formulations (Cai and Hayashi, 1994), analytictechniques based on a combination of linear elasticity theory
and Hertzian contact theory (Weber and Banaschek, 1951;
Wang et al., 2018), or polynomial curve ﬁts that are derived
from ﬁnite-element simulations (Kuang and Yang, 1992).
Note that these mesh stiffnesses are generally formulated
per unit of face width and thus assume a uniform contact
force distribution along the face width. In helical gears, how-
ever, the contact forces are nonuniformly distributed across
the tooth face width, depending on the gear microgeometry,
the helix angle and possible gear misalignments. Although
three-dimensional lumped-parameter models have been for-
mulated for helical gears (Eritenel and Parker, 2012), a more
common approach in wind turbine gearbox modeling – as
is also available in a number of commercial, ﬂexible, multi-
body simulation software packages – is to divide each heli-
cal gear into a number spur gear slices and to sum the stiff-
nesses and/or contact forces of the individual slices (Feng
et al., 2018). A similar slicing approach is applied in lumped-
parameter roller bearing modeling, where the contact force
distribution over the roller surfaces is a nonuniform line load
(De Mul et al., 1989b). Note that although lumped-parameter
approaches yield reasonably accurate and efﬁcient ball and
roller bearing models, contrary to lumped-parameter gear
contact models, these bearing models are rarely directly inte-
grated into system-level wind turbine drivetrain models; in-
stead, the models are used to derive linearized stiffness matri-
ces that describe the three-dimensional behavior of the bear-
ing at a selected operating point (Helsen et al., 2011).
Although lumped-parameter models enable the rapid con-
struction and efﬁcient evaluation of gear and bearing models,
they lack the modeling complexity required to evaluate dy-
namic behavior with, for example, gear geometric modiﬁca-
tions or housing ﬂexibility. This is desirable, e.g., in the anal-
ysis of planetary gear sets, where the ﬂexibility of the ring-
housing assembly has a considerable impact on the overall
gearbox behavior (Hu et al., 2019). In distributed parameter
methods, such as the ﬁnite-element method, the full geomet-
ric extent of the gear pair is considered, whereas a large part
of the lumped-parameter assumptions are replaced by ﬁrst
principles. The increased accuracy of these methods comes
at the price of an increased computational cost that is com-
patible only with static simulations (e.g., computing a linear
bearing stiffness matrix (Guo and Parker, 2012) or the stiff-
ness maps of a pair of gears (Palermo et al., 2013)). To alle-
viate the computational burden of the ﬁnite-element method
in dynamic simulations, two approaches have recently been
introduced. The ﬁrst approach combines the ﬁnite-element
method with semi-analytic results from classic contact the-
ory to eliminate the need for highly reﬁned ﬁnite-element
meshes in the zone of contact (Andersson and Vedmar, 2003;
Vijayakar, 1991). The second approach reduces the number
of degrees of freedom in the ﬁnite-element models by ap-
plying model-order-reduction techniques that are speciﬁcally
tailored toward dynamic contact problems (Blockmans et al.,
2015; Fiszer et al., 2016). Given the complexity of these

methods, however, the usage of ﬁnite-element-method-based
techniques to model gears and bearings in system-level drive-
train simulations remains largely restricted to the preprocess-
ing phase of the simulation or limited to static simulations.
In the absence of complex contact interactions, the modally
condensed ﬁnite-element method (Craig Jr. and Ni, 1989)
becomes a practical means for modeling complex, ﬂexible
components such as planet carriers, housings and the bed-
plate that exhibit relatively low-frequency modal behavior,
whereas shafts are commonly represented by Timoshenko
beam elements (Struggl et al., 2015). With the increasing size
of wind turbines, the ﬂexibility of these components becomes
increasingly important because it can signiﬁcantly affect in-
ternal load distributions and vibrations (Helsen et al., 2012).
Components with high stiffness-to-mass ratios, on the other
hand, are modeled as rigid bodies in which the number of
degrees of freedom equals 6 minus the number of applied
motion constraints. Couplings such as universal and revolute
joints are typically represented by algebraic constraint equa-
tions, whereas interference ﬁts, spline couplings and bolted
connections are commonly idealized into perfectly homoge-
neous rigid connections (Marrant et al., 2010). Another mod-
eling approach for spline couplings is to consider rigid in ro-
tation but soft in tilting directions (Guo et al., 2016).
Although signiﬁcant strides have been made in recent
years to increase the accuracy of wind turbine gearbox sim-
ulations, a number of challenges remain. With regard to gear
and bearing simulation, the modeling of contact-damping
phenomena is not nearly as effective and well understood
as the modeling of stiffness-related effects despite meritori-
ous contributions in this direction (Li and Kahraman, 2013).
In addition, the same techniques that resulted in effective
lumped-parameter gear contact models have failed to achieve
similar results in the ﬁeld of spline modeling. This is largely
because of the relatively large dimensions of the contact
zone, rendering Hertzian techniques inaccurate and slicing
techniques impractical. With unreduced ﬁnite-element-based
approaches (Kahn-Jetter and and Wright, 2000) as the main
resort, simulations often idealize spline couplings, which can
signiﬁcantly impact the contact load distributions, especially
in planetary gear stages. Finally, with the number of gearbox
modeling approaches continuously increasing in both the sci-
entiﬁc literature and in commercial software, there is a need
for identifying and validating the required levels of model-
ing accuracy in gearbox analyses, including forward dynamic
analyses (He et al., 2019), durability analyses (Ding et al.,
2018), transfer path analyses (Vanhollebeke et al., 2015) and
inverse analyses (Bosmans et al., 2020).
Wind turbine generators can be modeled in different lev-
els of detail, depending on the purpose of the study (As-
mine et al., 2010; Ugalde-Loo et al., 2012). When power
grid interaction of the wind plants is studied, in which the
performance of individual wind turbines is not concerned,
the individual generators can be lumped into equivalent ma-
chines represented at the collector buses (Kazachkov et al.,2003). To evaluate the impact of wind turbines on the power
grid by simulating power system dynamics, many simpliﬁed
approaches have been implemented depending on the level
of detail required (Slootweg et al., 2003; Akhmatov et al.,
2003; Ekanayake et al., 2003; Ullah et al., 2008). For power
system design, power ﬂow calculation, short-circuit model-
ing and power stability analysis, usually positive-sequence
or rms models are used, in which electromagnetic tran-
sients are neglected (Asmine et al., 2010). In IEC 61400-27-
1:2020, standard electrical simulation models of wind tur-
bine generators for power system and grid stability analy-
sis are described (Göksu et al., 2016). To address electro-
magnetic transients, e.g., when fault-ride-through strategies
are considered, electrical generator models should be built
based on their voltage equations (Trevisan et al., 2018). Con-
stant lumped parameters are typically used in these equa-
tions. For design and optimization of wind turbine genera-
tors, detailed electromagnetic models based on either ana-
lytical methods or ﬁnite-element methods (FEMs) are nec-
essary. For ﬁnal design and optimization, FEMs are exten-
sively used (Duan et al., 2010). For detailed analysis of gen-
erators under transients, e.g., in a fault run through, a circuit-
coupled FEM can be used to consider the parameter vari-
ations caused by electromagnetic nonlinearity. Cooling de-
sign of generators requires accurate calculation of losses and
temperature rises, which is usually carried out by coupled
FEMs or thermal-circuit analysis (Bhuiyan and McDonald,
2018; Kowal et al., 2013). As wind turbines grow in size, the
electromagneto-mechanical dynamics of the generator and
its associated mechanical components should be analyzed in
detail to avoid undesirable vibrations. In these analyses, a
three-dimensional FEM is sometimes necessary to consider
the rotor skewing. The whole machine must be modeled to
consider the eccentricity by estimating the radial deforma-
tion. Electromagnetic design of large wind generators should
consider both the power electronics and mechanical interac-
tions thoroughly, and pole-slot number combination, air-gap
length, air-gap radial forces, cogging torque and iron satura-
tions, eigenmodes, and eigenfrequencies should be carefully
studied in the electromagneto-mechanical coupling analysis
to result in a robust design (Sopanen et al., 2010; Kirschneck
et al., 2015; Desmedt et al., 2020).
Similarly, wind power converters can also be modeled
from different aspects with different levels of detail. Power
loss and thermal models are typically used for selection of
power switches, design of the cooling system and reliabil-
ity studies (Qin et al., 2015b), which is no different from
power electronics in other applications. For controller design
and ensuring the operation stability, electrical dynamic mod-
eling of the wind power converter is needed, in which the
coupled model of the plant, PWM (pulse-width modulation)
converter, power ﬁlters and power grid is engaged. In ear-
lier stages of control design, the average model of the PWM
converter is used to support the less computationally inten-
sive analysis of the controller performance, whereas in later

396 A. R. Nejad et al.: Wind turbine drivetrain technology
stages the full switching model is replaced. For grid impact
study, the impedance model of the grid-side wind power con-
verter is usually applied. In the impedance model, the wind
power converter is typically modeled as a Norton equiva-
lent, composed of a current source and an output impedance
(Larumbe et al., 2021; Vree et al., 2020). The impedance
model is especially appropriate for studying the harmonics
or stability of a wind plant because the impedance model of
a single wind power converter can easily be aggregated into
a plant. Not only the power ﬁlter but also the control of the
wind power converter affects its impedance model, including
the current controller, phase lock loop and even the DC link
voltage controller.
4 Operation and maintenance
O&M costs represent a sizable and potentially increasing
share of the LCOE, especially as wind’s LCOE declines be-
cause of reduced upfront costs and improved performance.
Recent data suggest that O&M can account for around 25 %
of the LCOE for onshore installations (Renewable Energy
Agency, 2012; Wiser et al., 2019; Steffen et al., 2020; Ren
et al., 2021) and more than 35 % for offshore installations
(Carroll et al., 2017; Röckmann et al., 2017; Ren et al., 2021).
Downtime must also be considered. Additionally, increased
availability might not lead to reduced O&M costs offshore
because vessel type costs must also be considered for turbine
repair. For example, crew transfer vessels have much lower
costs than jack-up vessels.
The maintenance paradigm is shifting from reactive, peri-
odic time or usage-based maintenance to reliability-centered
(or predictive) condition maintenance supported by digital
twins as elaborated in Sect. 5.3. If the turbines do not have
dedicated condition-monitoring systems, some anomaly de-
tection or fault diagnosis can be conducted based on the tur-
bine supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) sys-
tem data, for which the main purpose is operational control.
4.1 Condition monitoring and fault detection
Condition monitoring is an umbrella term that spans vari-
ous different ways of tracking the health state of a machine
in which typically vibration, temperatures, oil contamination
or electrical signatures from the generator are used as input
signals (Fu et al., 2017; Qiao and Qu, 2018). By using appro-
priate analysis methods, system changes caused by damaged
components (e.g., ﬂaking of bearing raceways) or faulty sys-
tem states (e.g., water contamination) can be identiﬁed. A
recent review of the condition monitoring of drivetrains is
offered by Helsen (2021). The following sections discuss the
two most commonly used types of condition monitoring for
wind turbine drivetrains along with the acoustic emissions
approach.4.1.1 SCADA-based condition monitoring
Wind turbine SCADA systems produce hundreds of channels
of data concerning the operation of a turbine based on multi-
ple installed sensors. In reality, only a small fraction of these
data provide valid information that can be used for condition
monitoring, and there is a signiﬁcant challenge in how to ex-
tract which information is important. SCADA data in wind
turbines are typically sampled at around 1 Hz and averaged
every 10 min. From a condition-monitoring point of view,
these data can serve as a low-cost potential solution because
no extra sensors are required. The entire list of parameters
tracked in the SCADA data is typically quite extensive, but
an overview of basic SCADA parameters is given in Table 1.
Normally, the extent and quality of the SCADA data depend
on the turbine manufacturer, though IEC 61400-25 is used as
a common protocol for data collection and labeling of param-
eters. Other possible uses besides condition monitoring in-
clude power curve analysis (Lydia et al., 2014) and modeling
with, for example, k-nearest neighbors (Kusiak et al., 2009),
spare part demand forecasting (Tracht et al., 2013) and load
monitoring (Wächter et al., 2015). Angular velocity measure-
ments from SCADA have also been used for fault detection
and remaining useful life (RUL) (Nejad et al., 2014b, 2018;
Moghadam and Nejad, 2021, 2022).
To analyze SCADA data, machine learning techniques are
often employed. One classiﬁcation of machine learning tech-
niques for wind turbine condition monitoring is to divide
them into supervised (classiﬁcation and regression) and un-
supervised (clustering) learning. An example of classiﬁca-
tion for fault detection, isolation and failure mode diagno-
sis on the gearbox is illustrated by Koukoura et al. (2019),
whereas Turnbull et al. (2019) applied a combination of clus-
tering and classiﬁcation techniques to group similar operat-
ing conditions and detect generator faults. An example of re-
gression to detect anomalies in vibration indicators can be
found in Verstraeten et al. (2019). The authors use Bayesian
ridge regression to ﬁt linear parameters and inherent noise to
the observed data while maintaining the uncertainty over the
parameters. This way the model can distinguish between ex-
pected and anomalous behavior while capturing the stochas-
ticity of the parameters. In Helsen et al. (2018), an ensem-
ble of models is used to classify bearing temperature data in
normal and anomalous behavior. An extensive review of ma-
chine learning approaches applied to wind turbines can be
found in Stetco et al. (2019).
Other researchers, for example Tautz-Weinert and Watson
(2016), categorize the different SCADA-based monitoring
methods into ﬁve classes: trending, clustering, normal behav-
ior modeling (NBM), damage modeling, and assessment of
alarms and expert systems.
i.Trending . A very straightforward approach is to monitor
the SCADA parameters over a long period of time and
to use statistical thresholds for alarming.

ing, main bearing, rotor shaft, generator shaft, generator slip ring, inverter

ii.Clustering . When large numbers of wind turbines need
to be monitored efﬁciently, it becomes imperative to
have an automatic manner to classify the turbines as
“healthy” or “faulty.” Examples of clustering can be
found in Kusiak and Zhang (2010), in which drivetrain
and tower accelerations are analyzed using SCADA
data by means of a modiﬁed k-means clustering condi-
tioned on the wind speed. Kim et al. (2011) and Catmull
(2011) applied self-organizing maps instead of k-means
to build such clusters. Despite these advancements, the
interpretation of the clustering results is often still per-
ceived to be difﬁcult (Tautz-Weinert and Watson, 2016).
iii.NBM . NBM employs the same idea of anomaly detec-
tion as the previous techniques, but it focuses more on
the empirical modeling of the measurements. The resid-
ual error between the modeled and observed parameter
then serves as a health indicator. A basic example of
NBM involves the use of linear and polynomial models.
A linear autoregressive model with exogenous inputs
was used by Garlick et al. (2009) to detect generator
bearing failures from the bearing temperature. Higher-
order polynomial full-signal reconstruction models of
drivetrain temperatures were developed by Wilkinson
et al. (2014) to detect gearbox and generator failures.
A popular form of NBM is to track changes in the
power curve as a function of wind speed. Faults such as
problems with blade pitching can change the shape of
the curve, though how to detect changes in the power
curve, which can show a signiﬁcant degree of varia-
tion even under normal conditions, is a challenge. A
method which has shown promise is to use a Gaussian
process (GP) model, e.g., Zhou et al. (2014); Manobel
et al. (2018); Pandit and Inﬁeld (2018b). Such a model
is able to ﬁt an accurate power curve to noisy data which
can then be used to predict future power values against
which observed values can be compared. Pandit et al.(2019) showed that multivariate input GP models in-
corporating both wind speed and air density were es-
pecially suitable for this purpose. In addition to power,
GP models can also be used to monitor other parameters
such as blade pitch angle and rotational speed (Pandit
and Inﬁeld, 2018a).
iv.Damage modeling . Instead of training empirical normal
behavior models, the measurements can be interpreted
with physical models to improve the accuracy. Gray and
Watson (2010) developed a damage model using physi-
cal failure modes of interest to estimate the failure prob-
ability. A general scheme for a physics-based monitor-
ing approach was proposed by Breteler et al. (2015).
v.Assessment of alarms and expert systems . The last class
looks at the outputs of the SCADA control alarms or the
NBM output alarms. A typical example of this class is
the analysis of the status codes of the wind turbine. Sta-
tus code processing approaches typically investigate the
possibility of extracting useful, actionable information
about the health of the turbine from these status codes,
and there exist many different ways to do this. For ex-
ample, Chen et al. (2012) used a probabilistic approach
with Bayesian networks to track down root causes for
failures such as a pitch fault. Qiu et al. (2012) also used
Bayes’ theorem and compared the extracted patterns us-
ing a Venn diagram. Other approaches often involve ma-
chine learning, such as Kusiak and Li (2011), who used
neural network ensembles to predict status codes and
their severity to detect a malfunction. Lastly, a signif-
icant amount of research examines the use of “expert”
systems to interpret the status codes or model outputs.
Often these systems are based on using fuzzy logic to
determine a diagnosis for anomalies. Example research
works that are based on or employ fuzzy logic are given
in Garcia et al. (2006); Schlechtingen et al. (2013); Sun

4.1.2 Vibration-based condition monitoring
In general, vibration-based condition monitoring is by far the
most prevalent and widely used method, largely because of
its ease of instrumentation and its reliable response to dam-
age development (Randall, 2011). First, the majority of all
vibration signal-processing techniques have some require-
ment of stationarity. In most cases, stationarity in time is
required for harmonic frequencies such that spectrum-based
approaches are not invalidated because of frequency smear-
ing. Wind turbines, however, are far from stationary ma-
chines because the wind dictates the rotation speed of the
rotor. This speed ﬂuctuation leads to time-varying harmonic
frequencies of the vibration sources, such as gears, shafts
or bearings. Knowledge of the speed is therefore crucial for
many signal-processing methods because this speed ﬂuctu-
ation needs to be compensated or considered. A common,
accurate and reliable way to gain this speed information is
through the installation of an angle encoder or tachometer
on one of the rotating shafts in the gearbox. An alternative
is to estimate the instantaneous angular speed directly from
the vibration signal itself. An overview and comparison of
the state of the art in vibration-based rotation speed estima-
tion can be found in Peeters et al. (2019) and Leclère et al.
(2016).
From a statistical point of view, gear vibration signals
are considered deterministic because the gears are locked
in place and do not exhibit random slippage like bear-
ings. On the other hand, bearing vibrations are regarded as
stochastic in nature because of the random slippage of the
roller elements, and they are normally characterized as be-
ing second-order cyclostationary, meaning they have a pe-
riodic autocorrelation. This distinction in statistical charac-
teristics provides an opportunity for signal-processing meth-
ods to separate gear from bearing signals; therefore, a com-
mon follow-up step to angular resampling is employing a sig-
nal separation technique, such as discrete or random separa-
tion (Antoni and Randall, 2004b), self-adaptive noise can-
cellation (Antoni and Randall, 2004a), linear prediction ﬁl-
tering (Sawalhi and Randall, 2004), the (generalized) time-
synchronous average (Abboud et al., 2017, 2016), or cep-
strum editing (Peeters et al., 2018). Alternative signal sepa-
ration methods – such as (ensemble) empirical mode decom-
position (Huang et al., 1998; Wu and Huang, 2009), princi-
pal component analysis or variational mode decomposition
(Dragomiretskiy and Zosso, 2013) – can isolate signal sub-
spaces in the vibration, but these subspaces are typically not
guaranteed to have any relevance to mechanical components
because they do not employ any prior physical knowledge.
After preprocessing the vibration signal, the last step in-
volves the identiﬁcation of potential faults. Current prac-
tice in condition-monitoring systems often revolves aroundtracking time-domain statistical indicators (de Azevedo et al.,
2016; Lu et al., 2009; Tchakoua et al., 2014). Examples of
some commonly used time-domain indicators are given in
Ali et al. (2018); Zhu et al. (2014); D’Elia et al. (2015);
Veˇceˇr et al. (2005); Rai and Upadhyay (2016); Sharma and
Parey (2016); Decker et al. (1994); Zakrajsek et al. (1993),
and Bozchalooi and Liang (2007). These time indicators can
all be used to characterize trends in measured vibration sig-
nals.
The main reason why spectral methods are so popular in
condition monitoring is that they allow for not only fault de-
tection but also fault diagnosis. For gears, approaches for
fault detection usually focus more on tracking the amplitudes
of harmonics and sidebands in the spectrum or the cepstrum,
whereas for bearings more cyclostationarity-based methods
tend to be employed. Nonetheless, for gear faults it is also
recommended to look at the cyclostationary signature of a
signal because distributed gear faults can signiﬁcantly im-
pact the modulation of the deterministic gear signals. A local
fault on one of the gear teeth will introduce low-level side-
bands in the spectrum, whereas distributed gear damage ex-
hibits higher-level sidebands.
The presence of modulation sidebands is also the main
reason why cepstrum-based techniques are popular for gear
diagnostics. Because the cepstrum groups together equally
spaced harmonics, it provides a very effective means to track
the average amplitude of the sidebands. A summary of meth-
ods applied for the diagnosis of a faulty gearbox is presented
in Sheng (2012).
The most popular approach for the analysis of second-
order cyclostationary signals (and, correspondingly, for bear-
ing diagnostics) is envelope analysis. The envelope of a sig-
nal is considered to be any function that “encloses” the en-
ergy variation in the signal. By taking the modulus of the
analytic version of the signal, obtained through the Hilbert
transform, the envelope time waveform can be found (given
that the envelope frequency of interest respects Bedrosian’s
theorem; Bedrosian, 1963). Usually the envelope is squared
(effectively done by multiplying the analytic signal with its
conjugate) before taking the Fourier transform to analyze its
envelope spectrum (Ho and Randall, 2000).
4.1.3 Acoustic emissions condition monitoring
To detect strong nonstationary signals such as sudden crack
propagation, using acoustic emissions could be a suitable so-
lution. This technology has already been proven for crack
detection on pressure tanks, and its applicability for monitor-
ing of rotating components is being researched with promis-
ing results. For example, rolling bearings have been exposed
to critical operating conditions, such as high-friction lubri-
cation regimes, overloading or high angular accelerations,
which were successfully detected and differentiated using an
acoustic-emissions-based detection scheme (Couturier and
Mba, 2008; Cockerill et al., 2016; Cornel et al., 2018, 2020).

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
A. R. Nejad et al.: Wind turbine drivetrain technology 399
Further, acoustic emissions have been successfully used for
the detection of subsurface cracks in bearings with a re-
sponse time up to 55 % earlier than classic vibration-based
detection (Cornel et al., 2021). Further investigations are be-
ing carried out to assess the economic value of this earlier
response. Nonetheless, there are still several challenges to
be addressed, such as ﬁltering ambient noise or differentia-
tion between individual and overlapping signals of individual
components like bearings, gears and couplings.
A further complex but promising challenge of bearing con-
dition monitoring is linking different data acquisition tech-
niques, such as monitoring acoustic emissions and electrical
effects or using SCADA data (de Azevedo et al., 2016). To
overcome this and the aforementioned challenges, two key
aspects need to be addressed in further research:
–fault diagnosis algorithm – the distinct feature extrac-
tion of speciﬁc fault mechanisms in real-world appli-
cations in nonstationary operating conditions, including
the integration between condition-monitoring systems;
the estimation of the RUL; and new methods of signal
analysis, such as machine learning;
–sensor selection and placement – the distinct, transfer-
able description of the inﬂuence of fault-mechanism-
speciﬁc components inside a complex mechanical sys-
tem on the system’s vibration behavior.
Further, each gearbox has a different behavior; therefore, the
ﬁrst step to reach dynamic system condition monitoring is
to obtain reliable characteristic information from the system
behavior.
4.2 Remaining useful life
The term “consumed life” of a component is a metric that can
be calculated based on existing rating methods by using ac-
tual loads (whereas design loads are used in the development
phase), while “remaining life” is the best estimation of how
long a component will survive, which requires statistical pre-
diction models. The consumed life calculation of drivetrain
mechanical components, such as bearings and gears, requires
the analysis of measurements from the ﬁeld, such as gearbox
temperatures, bearing vibration measurements and wind tur-
bine operational measurements. Such measurements can be
continuous online recordings or measurements taken during
inspections such as oil quality sampling. Typical indicators
for the consumption of the life of the gearbox are
–the number of particles in the gearbox oil per time dura-
tion or the particulates in the grease for greased bearings
(Feng et al., 2013),
–the size of the particles in the oil;
–the frequency of the oil temperature or bearing temper-
ature excursions above a threshold (Feng et al., 2013);–changes in vibration spectrum signatures.
The distribution of particulates in the oil or grease can be an-
alyzed in a laboratory to identify the chemicals present and
thereby their source to determine their origin from the bear-
ings or gears.
With advanced multibody simulation tools, it is also pos-
sible to model all elements of the drivetrain fully coupled
to the aeroelastic interactions of the rotor (Gallego-Calderon
and Natarajan, 2015; Gallego-Calderon et al., 2017; Wang
et al., 2020) and mounted on a ﬂexible tower. In such a soft-
ware tool, the drivetrain is subject to continuous wind-driven
excitation and grid-driven events. If the response of the driv-
etrain in terms of the bearing displacements and shaft loads
is validated with the physical turbine during different oper-
ating conditions, then the software tool can be used to track
fatigue damage consumption in the drivetrain by supplying
it with measured operating conditions from the physical tur-
bine. This also requires speciﬁc drivetrain component failure
modes to be tracked in the simulation, such as the occur-
rences of bearing roller sliding (Dabrowski and Natarajan,
2017) or the vibration excitation of different components.
Monitoring fatigue damage growth also provides knowledge
of the remaining useful life of the drivetrain if the design life
of the components of the drivetrain are known (Doner, 2020).
Monitoring systems and modeling tools are also increasingly
being integrated with supply chain management systems to
reduce downtime and O&M costs (Nordmark and Boyeye,
2021).
Moreover, the inverse methods can also be employed to
estimate the loads on drivetrain components from SCADA
and vibration measurements and can be used to estimate the
component fatigue damage and RUL (Mehlan et al., 2021).
Dynamic models of the drivetrain might be needed in some
cases if not enough data or measurements are available that
can be developed provided that basic information about the
drivetrain (e.g., geometry, bearing types and gear teeth num-
bers) is known (van Binsbergen et al., 2021).
4.3 Lifetime extension
Once a turbine reaches its 20-year design life, there are, in
principle, three options that can be considered by the opera-
tor: decommissioning, full repowering or lifetime extension
(Tartt et al., 2021). Full repowering and lifetime extension
can accomplish the goal of extending the service life of exist-
ing wind turbines. The main beneﬁt is to increase returns on
investments and reduce the levelized cost of energy for wind
power. Full repowering refers to the dismantling of old wind
turbines and replacing them with new ones. Lifetime exten-
sion, on the other hand, refers to the assessment of the re-
maining useful life and possible turbine component upgrades
while keeping the turbine hub height, size or plant layout un-
changed. Partial repowering or refurbishment (Topham and
McMillan, 2017) is another term used in the industry for re-
https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-7-387-2022 Wind Energ. Sci., 7, 387–411, 2022
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
400 A. R. Nejad et al.: Wind turbine drivetrain technology
placing and upgrading the components; this can be consid-
ered an option in the lifetime extension process.
Whether and how to conduct lifetime extension is a com-
plex decision-making process and depends on many factors,
including technical, economical and legal factors (Ziegler
et al., 2018). The prerequisite is that the turbine’s structural
integrity – e.g., foundation, tower, nacelle and hub – has been
assessed and can be safely used throughout the expected tur-
bine lifetime extension span. Sometimes these assessments
also include blades, which, if not strong enough, could be
upgraded as well. Speciﬁc to drivetrain components, typical
practices are replacing them with newer products – e.g., gear-
boxes, main bearings or generators – which have improved
performance and reliability. On the other hand, from the driv-
etrain research-and-development perspective, some opportu-
nities lie in reliability assessment and driving event identi-
ﬁcation, which can beneﬁt from fault diagnostics and RUL
prediction research conducted to support wind plant O&M.
The expected outputs are more accurate and reliable drive-
train component integrity assessment based on historical data
or inspection as well as prediction throughout the planned
lifetime extension period. Should the evaluation be positive
with an acceptable conﬁdence level, the drivetrain compo-
nents might not be replaced, as is currently practiced now,
and additional costs of the turbine lifetime extension can be
reduced.
Tartt et al. (2021) investigated the lifetime extension prac-
tices in other industries and proposed a methodology for
wind turbine drivetrains. The industry’s experience with life-
time extension is still limited. Also, different markets – e.g.,
Europe or the United States – might require different strate-
gies. There are a few uncertainty concerns: (i) technically,
how trustworthy the integrity assessment of the structural
components is; (ii) economically, how the assumed future
electricity prices might hold true; and (iii) legally, how re-
lated policies might change.
4.4 Decommissioning and recycling
Wind turbines are typically decommissioned and recycled –
at least partially – at the end of their service life because of
both their salvage value and local legislative requirements,
so decommissioning has increasingly become part of the
planning process (Jensen, 2019). Detailed discussions on the
decommissioning process for land-based and offshore wind
turbines, recycling analysis of different turbine subsystems,
basic cost analysis, and the environmental impacts can be
found in Jensen (2019). The main challenges surrounding the
decommissioning process of wind plants are the regulatory
framework, the overall planning of the process, the trans-
portation logistics and the environmental impacts (Topham
et al., 2019a).
Studies show that recycling after decommissioning can
pay back some of the decommissioning costs (Topham et al.,
2019b). The main parts of the drivetrain from the recyclingperspective are the bearings, gears, frames, shafts, couplings,
windings, cores (generator stator and rotor), permanent mag-
nets, hydraulic cooling systems and electronics. Windings
are made of copper. Cores are made of electrical steel lam-
ination, which is an iron alloy to which silicon is added.
Bearings, gears, frames, shafts and couplings are made of
different types of alloy steel. Permanent magnets used in
wind turbine PMSGs are often NdFeB magnets. Hydraulics
are considered less problematic because the recycling indus-
try is accustomed to handling the related components. Reuse
of lubricants is also being explored (SKF, 2021). Electron-
ics are usually difﬁcult to recycle because of their complex
material composition. Nearly all waste electronics equip-
ment is currently shredded, and further physical processes,
including magnetic and electrostatic techniques, are applied
to separate different metal fractions. Two main methods are
used to recycle these components: shredding and disassem-
bling. The method used depends on the recycled component,
the size and the material. Recycling can be supported by
robotics and using optimization models to optimize the pro-
cess (Rassõlkin et al., 2018). Separate parts of disassembled
components are reused if they do not have any damage. The
rest are remelted as the same raw material or to a new alloy.
High-volume drivetrain recycling needs to minimize en-
vironmental impact (no harmful chemicals or emissions or
energy-intensive processes) and have high recovery rates of
rare and precious materials while still being economically
viable. Recycling can also be in the design phase. For ex-
ample, surface-mounted PMSGs compared to interior rotor
magnets have different disassembling procedures. Modular
design can also offer a clear advantage in recycling because
healthy parts can be separately reused in other components
of that type.
Further, the use of recycled material can lead to cheaper
new products (Gabhane and Kaddoura, 2017), which, apart
from being more environmentally friendly, can be a good
motivation for recycling. Recycling and reusing can also con-
tribute to reducing the potential supply chain risk, especially
for rare-earth materials (Habib and Wenzel, 2014).
5 Emerging areas
Three areas – drivetrains in ﬂoating turbines, drivetrains and
plant considerations, and digitalization – are considered to be
emerging areas. Veers et al. (2019) have highlighted “aero-
dynamics, structural dynamics, and offshore wind hydrody-
namics of enlarged wind turbines” as one of the grand chal-
lenges in wind energy science. Floating wind turbines are
then specially pointed out because of additional degrees of
freedom and motions. Understanding the turbine responses
and interaction with the wind ﬂow in the plant is also empha-
sized (Veers et al., 2019). Moreover, digitalization has in re-
cent years changed the societies. According to the EU’s dig-
Wind Energ. Sci., 7, 387–411, 2022 https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-7-387-2022
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
A. R. Nejad et al.: Wind turbine drivetrain technology 401
ital strategy, digitalization is one of the medium-term chal-
lenges facing the EU (EU, 2018).
5.1 Drivetrain in ﬂoating turbines
Drivetrains in ﬂoating wind turbines are exposed to differ-
ent dynamic loads than those on bottom-ﬁxed or land-based
ones. Apart from the wind loads, the wave-induced motions
can affect the drivetrain load responses. The wave-induced
motions can have a negative impact on the main bearing fa-
tigue life – particularly on the one carrying axial loads – as
highlighted by Nejad et al. (2015). Sethuraman et al. (2014)
investigated the effects of the ﬂoating wind turbine motion
on direct-drive generator air-gap integrity and showed that
the air-gap stability of the generator is more sensitive to mag-
netic forces if the supporting frame is relatively rigid. They
also highlighted the need for air-gap management for direct-
drive generators on ﬂoating platforms.
A recent full-scale experimental ﬁeld study of a 6 MW
drivetrain on a spar ﬂoating substructure (Torsvik et al.,
2021) indicates that the effect of wave-induced motions
might not be as signiﬁcant as the wind loading on the drive-
train responses, particularly in larger turbines. A set of strain
measurements on the main bearing show that the effect of
wave motions is negligible compared with the tower shadow
excitation (Torsvik et al., 2021).
The study by Nejad and Torsvik (2021) investigated the
lessons learned in the last 10 years with regard to drive-
trains on ﬂoating wind turbines. Among other things, the
study highlighted that the maximum tower-top axial acceler-
ation might not be a reasonable limiting factor for the fatigue
life of main bearings in ﬂoating wind turbines, at least for a
spar-type ﬂoating turbine (Nejad et al., 2019). It also empha-
sized that a ﬂexible bedplate inﬂuences the main bearing and
components inside the gearbox, and therefore the coupling
effects between the structure and the drivetrain need to be
considered in ﬂoating wind turbines, particularly in compact
design concepts. Given the limited experience with ﬂoating
wind turbines, however, more research is needed.
5.2 Drivetrain and plant consideration
Wakes induced by other turbines in the plant cause increased
turbulence and thus can affect the loading on the drivetrain
(Roscher et al., 2017). How the wakes are controlled at the
plant level will therefore inﬂuence the drivetrain design life
(van Binsbergen et al., 2020). Several approaches which have
recently been proposed to reduce overall plant losses by re-
ducing wake effects employ either some form of static or
dynamic induction control or wake steering by yaw control
(Andersson et al., 2021). Static induction control aims to re-
duce the strength of the wake of an upstream machine by
changing the pitch of the blades or the rotational speed of the
rotor in such a way as to reduce the thrust at the expense of
some efﬁciency but to allow downstream machines to see anincreased wind speed so that the combined output of the tur-
bines is increased. However, in practice, little gain is seen us-
ing this approach (Bartl and Sætran, 2016). Dynamic induc-
tion control seeks to increase wake mixing and thus reduce
plant losses by periodically pitching the blades during each
rotor rotation (Frederik et al., 2020). Wake steering takes a
different approach, whereby an upstream turbine is delib-
erately yawed out of the prevailing wind direction (again
slightly reducing turbine efﬁciency) with the aim of ensuring
that downstream machines are out of its wake, thus increas-
ing their output and increasing overall plant efﬁciency (Flem-
ing et al., 2017) but also affecting shaft torque and blade mo-
ments (Damiani et al., 2018). Wake steering typically does
not have large effects on the drivetrain of the upstream tur-
bine, whereas an increase in the yaw angle would lead to an
increase in the drivetrain load variation in the downstream
turbine (van Binsbergen et al., 2020). In contrast, increases
in blade pitch angle associated with static induction con-
trol would reduce the standard deviations of the drivetrain
dynamic response of the upstream wind turbine, whereas it
would not signiﬁcantly affect the standard deviations in the
downstream turbine (van Binsbergen et al., 2020).
Based on the study performed by van Binsbergen et al.
(2020), the wake impact on the downstream turbine can re-
duce the lifetime of the ﬁrst main bearing of the drivetrain by
17 %, and it can reduce the turbine power intake by 30 %. The
mitigation of loads on the drivetrain of the wind turbine and
an increase in power capture at the turbine level are addressed
in the literature on turbine control by optimizing the gener-
ator torque, blade pitch and yaw steering controls (as shown
in, for example, van Binsbergen et al., 2020, and Fleming
et al., 2013). Optimized wind power plant management by
considering the inﬂuence of wakes was recently studied by
Andersson and Imsland (2020).
The optimized plant control design to maximize the wind
plant power intake and simultaneously minimize the degra-
dation of the drivetrain components inﬂuenced by wake loads
is still an open research problem. The latter calls for high-
ﬁdelity models of wake ﬂow and wake loads on the drivetrain
of downstream turbines and the drivetrain system to study the
drivetrain load effects and responses and, ﬁnally, the deriva-
tion of sufﬁcient drivetrain-lifetime-related constraints that
can be integrated into the plant stochastic model predictive
control design framework. From this perspective, the addi-
tional role of wind plant control is to distribute accumulated
fatigue evenly over the drivetrains of different turbines to im-
prove the reliability of the plant.
5.3 Drivetrain and digitalization
The use of digital technologies and digitized data can sup-
port wind turbine drivetrain analyses at both the system and
component levels, for instance by receiving and transmitting
real-time data through the data acquisition and transmission
layers; by storing and processing data through the platform
https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-7-387-2022 Wind Energ. Sci., 7, 387–411, 2022
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
402 A. R. Nejad et al.: Wind turbine drivetrain technology
layer; and, ﬁnally, by decision support through the applica-
tion layer (An et al., 2021). For this purpose, digitalization
targets the sensors and actuators installed on the drivetrain
and the other turbine systems – such as the site network,
servers and even smart phones (André et al., 2021) – that are
connected to the turbine’s and plant’s control and monitoring
systems to improve reliability, availability, quality of service
and user experience.
Digital twin models can support the drivetrain’s design
and operation. Digital twin in this context includes sensors
(data collection), models (dynamic and degradation models)
and decision support platform (e.g., estimation of remain-
ing useful life) (Johansen and Nejad, 2019). Computationally
inexpensive digital twin models can support the predictive
maintenance of drivetrain system components by monitor-
ing the remaining useful lifetime of the critical components
(e.g., the gears of the gearbox) in real time (Moghadam and
Nejad, 2022). Using the existing physical models, integrat-
ing them in a uniﬁed framework, applying signal-processing
techniques to estimate these models and model inputs in
real time from available measurements, optimizing the data
streaming between models, using continuous processing ar-
chitectures, and using statistical approaches and stochastic
modeling techniques to model and mitigate the impact of
uncertainties are the tasks under the umbrella of a digital
twin. The risk associated with digital twin implementation,
specially in terms of wrong decision support, should also be
considered (Ibrion et al., 2019). In general, challenges of dig-
ital twin models mainly arise from the following (Moghadam
et al., 2021):
–ﬁnding the minimum or appropriate model ﬁdelity re-
quired to capture the dynamics of the component for
different operation and failure modes for a wide range
of drivetrain components
–optimizing data streaming between models and data
processing algorithms and continuously processing ar-
chitectures to deal with the real-time aspects of digital
twin models
–developing a preprocessing stage to model and mitigate
the different sources of uncertainty and to verify and en-
sure time synchronicity when the data come from differ-
ent sources and when dealing with the different sample
rates.
To overcome these challenges, merging edge computing
with the Internet of Things (IoT) can play a signiﬁcant role.
Using distributed computing algorithms supported by edge
computing data-handling architectures (e.g., fog computing)
has been recently adapted from computer science for wind
plant control and monitoring systems to signiﬁcantly reduce
the computational burden of implementing digital twin mod-
els’ complex algorithms to monitor drivetrain components in
future wind turbine O&M analyses (Verstraeten et al., 2019).By using fog computing, it is possible to break the digital
twin into simple subproblems with less computational com-
plexity, and each one can be executed on a fog. The IoT can
provide real-time access to data in each network node with
the possibility of using the processing and storage capacities
of the nodes for control and monitoring purposes, and not all
data in fogs need to be shared with other fogs or even the
cloud. Cybersecurity frameworks should be deployed at the
communication network and the computing modules to guar-
antee the integrity, authenticity, conﬁdentiality and availabil-
ity of the data while they are being transmitted over the net-
work nodes. Because future wind plants’ control and moni-
toring systems will need to handle more voluminous, hetero-
geneous data and distributed features, but storage and pro-
cessing capacities are limited, the IoT can signiﬁcantly im-
prove turbine control and monitoring.
6 Summary and concluding remarks
This paper presents the state of the art and future develop-
ment trends for wind turbine drivetrain technologies from
the life cycle perspective. Lighter and more compact design
concepts are the most cost-effective option, particularly for
large offshore turbines. As a result, the integration of elec-
tromechanical systems together with the main bearing has
been a recent trend. For land-based applications, geared driv-
etrains seem to be the dominant technology; however, the
race between geared or not is still ongoing for offshore,
with medium-speed (or hybrid concept) or even high-speed
geared drivetrains under development for large offshore wind
turbines. The extensive research and development of gear-
box and bearing design has mainly been on improving re-
liability by better understanding the failure modes in oper-
ation on one hand and, on the other hand, on the develop-
ment of new technologies, e.g., plain bearings. The medium-
speed concepts have shown to be a promising compromise
between high-speed and direct-drive designs, whereas high-
speed, multistage gearboxes have also been a research fo-
cus in recent years. For offshore turbine generators, there
has been a recent increasing trend toward direct-drive sys-
tems and PMSGs with full-power converter systems rather
than DFIGs with partial-power-converter systems. Supercon-
ducting generators are also seen as an attractive alternative to
PMSGs because of the large quantity of rare-earth materials
needed for PMSGs.
Given the criticality of drivetrain components in wind tur-
bines, condition-based maintenance is seen as an essential
element, at least for offshore and large turbines. In newer
and larger turbines, greater than 2.5 MW or 3 MW, most if
not all have dedicated condition-monitoring systems, which
typically monitor the gearbox, main bearings and generator.
Their outputs can be used to support anomaly detection, fault
diagnostics and prognostics models. These models can be
data-driven, physics-based or hybrid, integrating both data-

and physics-domain models. In the data domain, particularly
for SCADA-based condition monitoring, machine learning
and artiﬁcial intelligence technologies are being actively in-
vestigated for wind turbine applications.
Condition-monitoring technologies deployed for wind tur-
bine drivetrains are generally good at fault diagnostics, espe-
cially for high-speed components. The performance of vari-
ous solutions in terms of prognostics still needs to improve,
which presents an opportunity to bridge progress made by
the research community. On the other hand, the industry has
long been eager to obtain accurate predictions of component
remaining useful life, which is one objective of typical fault
prognostics. Among the various drivetrain subcomponents,
bearing faults have shown to be prevalent and have been ac-
tively investigated by both industry and researchers.
As the industry moves farther offshore and into deeper
water, increasing numbers of ﬂoating wind turbines are ex-
pected to be used. The early lessons highlight differences in
terms of dynamic behavior and life of the drivetrain in ﬂoat-
ing wind turbines compared with ﬁxed ones, especially for
the main bearings. As offshore turbine sizes are increasing,
the component ﬂexibility and potential dynamic coupling ef-
fects should not be overlooked during design modeling and
analysis.
Another emerging area of research for drivetrains is dig-
italization. Apart from data processing and digital mod-
els, data handling, ownership, security, communication and
transfer at the scale of large wind plants are also interesting
challenges. The use of digital twins for condition monitoring
is also a recent research direction.
In summary, the grand challenges in drivetrain research
discussed in this paper include load and load effects of driv-
etrains in large wind turbines as well as ﬂoating ones, inﬂu-
ence of wake and farm control, generator technologies and
use of rare-earth materials, employing prognostics to im-
prove reliability, and use of advances in digitalization such
as digital twin models. Addressing these challenges calls
for more interdisciplinary research and collaborations to im-
prove wind turbine drivetrain reliability and availability with
the main aim to reduce the cost of energy over time.
