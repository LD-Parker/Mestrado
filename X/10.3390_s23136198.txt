Abstract: Fault alarm time lag is one of the difÔ¨Åculties in fault diagnosis of wind turbine generators
(WTGs), and the existing methods are insufÔ¨Åcient to achieve accurate and rapid fault diagnosis of
WTGs, and the operation and maintenance costs of WTGs are too high. To invent a new method
for fast and accurate fault diagnosis of WTGs, this study constructs a stacking integration model
based on the machine learning algorithms light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), extreme
gradient boosting (XGBoost), and stochastic gradient descent regressor (SGDRegressor) using pub-
licly available datasets from Energias De Portugal (EDP). This model is automatically tuned for
hyperparameters during training using Bayesian tuning, and the coefÔ¨Åcient of determination (R2)
and root mean square error (RMSE) were used to evaluate the model to determine its applicability
and accuracy. The Ô¨Åtted residuals of the test set were calculated, the Pauta criterion (3 ) and the
temporal sliding window were applied, and a Ô¨Ånal adaptive threshold method for accurate fault
diagnosis and alarming was created. The model validation results show that the adaptive threshold
method proposed in this study is better than the Ô¨Åxed threshold for diagnosis, and the alarm times
for the GENERATOR fault type, GENERATOR_BEARING fault type, and TRANSFORMER fault
type are 1.5 h, 5.8 h, and 3 h earlier, respectively.

1. Introduction
As the global demand for energy continues to climb, the massive consumption of
fossil-fuel-derived energy not only leads to increased environmental pollution, but also
limits the sustainable socio-economic development. Therefore, renewable energy has been
developed rapidly and has gradually become a research hotspot, among which wind energy
is one of the most important components of renewable energy [ 1‚Äì3] and plays a key role in
the low-carbon transformation of the power industry. Currently, the global wind power
industry is growing rapidly and the cumulative installed capacity is gradually climbing [ 4].
According to the World Wind Energy Report 2023 published by the Global Wind Energy
Council (GWEC) [ 5], the global installed wind power capacity was 77.6 GW in 2022 and is
expected to exceed 100 GW in 2024. The data shows that wind power is one of the most
important energy sources, therefore, parameters such as wind power energy efÔ¨Åciency,
wind turbine fault diagnosis, and fault warning forecasting should be given more attention.
However, traditional wind power plants rely on regular maintenance and post mainte-
nance, and the long deployment cycle of spare parts leads to high failure maintenance costs,
which has a huge impact on the operation and maintenance economics of wind power
plants [ 6]. In addition, wind turbine generators (WTGs) are usually installed in areas with
abundant wind energy resources but that are remote and harsh environments, making

equipment maintenance more difÔ¨Åcult [ 7]. The aging of WTGs leads to the degradation
of power production performance and reduces the economic efÔ¨Åciency. Lagging fault
diagnosis can lead to faults not being detected in time, which in turn delays fault repair
and maintenance. In addition, the continued operation of WTGs under fault conditions
increases the load and risk, compromises the reliability and performance of the equipment,
and leads to high O&M costs for WTGs. Therefore, to effectively reduce downtime and
avoid serious component damage, there is an urgent need to explore an efÔ¨Åcient fault diag-
nosis technique to achieve an efÔ¨Åcient and sustainable diagnosis method for wind turbines.
This method can optimize the maintenance strategy and avoid unnecessary maintenance
activities, so that the fault diagnosis technique can become a way to reduce the O&M cost
of wind power projects and Ô¨Ånally maximize the proÔ¨Åt [8‚Äì10].
Existing methods for fault diagnosis of WTGs can be divided into model-based meth-
ods, vibration signal methods, and data-driven methods [ 11‚Äì13]. Model-based methods
usually require a mathematical model to describe the structure, characteristics, and op-
eration of the WTG, and ultimately detect potential faults and abnormalities through
simulation and analysis [ 14]. For example, Dey et al. [ 15] proposed a cascade approach
based on two Kalman Ô¨Ålters to construct a detection model that mitigates the effect of non-
linear aerodynamic torques in the drivetrain dynamics. Jlassi et al. [16] proposed a model
based on a doubly-fed wind power system, where a state observer of the rotor current was
established to Ô¨Ånally achieve the detection of rotor converter faults. However, the model
building process is complex and tedious, requiring consideration of multiple factors and
parameters, and the accuracy of models is affected by various factors such as parameter un-
certainties and external environmental disturbances, thus affecting their diagnostic veracity
and accuracy [ 17]. The vibration signal method is a common non-destructive testing (NDT)
technique that can detect faults and abnormalities that are present in a unit by collecting,
processing, and analyzing vibration signals without damaging the object under test, such
as bearing faults, gear faults, and blade faults [ 18‚Äì22]. For example, Rezamand et al. [ 23]
created a feature-based fault prediction method in the process of the fault study of wind
turbine bearings. Although certain results have been achieved in the failure of bearings,
the reasonableness of the feature selection for this study needs to be considered. However,
the data of the vibration signal method are susceptible to interference from environmental
noise, leading to misclassiÔ¨Åcation or omission, which limits the prospects of this method in
fault diagnosis [ 24,25]. Data-driven methods are mainly used for fault diagnosis using the
supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data system, and this system is capable
of collecting rich operational data and operating for all available conditions, such as wind
speed, temperature, and rotational speed. This system can monitor the operating status of
the equipment in real time and can issue fault alerts in time. In addition, the system can
communicate with other devices to exchange data and take measures to protect the system
from malicious intrusion [ 2,26‚Äì31]. Wang et al. [ 32] proposed a deep conÔ¨Ådence network for
feature learning and classiÔ¨Åcation based on SCADA data to achieve sensor fault detection.
Among them, neural networks (NNs), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF),
and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) [ 33‚Äì40] are the most commonly used algorithms. However,
this method has high data requirements, and the handling of missing data and outliers
needs careful consideration. In summary, most studies on wind turbine fault diagnosis
still use a single algorithmic model. Due to the limitations of the models themselves, these
methods usually have difÔ¨Åculty in capturing complex fault patterns and are susceptible to
outliers or noise [ 41]. Therefore, the use of integrated learning is important to improve the
accuracy and robustness of classiÔ¨Åers. Stacking integration algorithms can well capture
the speciÔ¨Åc difÔ¨Åculties between different algorithms and weigh the advantages between
them to improve the accuracy and reliability of fault diagnosis [ 42]. The use of a stacking
integrated algorithm model has certain advantages for accurate fault diagnosis in WTGs.
Therefore, a fault diagnosis method for WTGs based on a stacking integration algo-
rithm and adaptive thresholds was proposed. In this study, a fusion model of a stacking
integrated algorithm was used to integrate the light gradient boosting machine (Light-

GBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and stochastic gradient descent regressor
(SGDRegressor) algorithms. In addition, this study also uses the Bayesian tuning method
to tune the model parameters, thus signiÔ¨Åcantly improving the comprehensive diagnostic
performance of the model. At the level of the diagnosis method, this study proposes an
adaptive threshold method combining the Pauta criterion (3 ) and a temporal sliding win-
dow, which can effectively reduce the false alarm situations during the diagnosis process
and realize the diagnosis and alarm of the fault in advance. This diagnosis method for
WTGs proposed in this study makes full use of the advantages of linear algorithms and
decision tree algorithms, while making up for the shortcomings of each, so that it has better
information extraction and fault analysis capabilities. In addition, this study creates an
adaptive threshold method for fault diagnosis, which provides a new perspective for the
accurate diagnosis of wind turbine faults and has obvious innovation and value, and can
provide technical support for the development of the global wind power business.
2. Methods and Principles
The LightGBM and XGBoost were chosen as the base learners, and, Ô¨Ånally, the SG-
DRegressor was selected as the meta-learner, to construct the stacking integrated model.
Meanwhile, the hyperparameters were tuned using the Bayesian tuning method. The
prediction effectiveness of the model was evaluated using the coefÔ¨Åcient of determina-
tion (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). In addition, an adaptive threshold fault
precision diagnosis and alarm method was proposed by combining the 3 criterion and
the temporal sliding window, where the principles of each method are described in the
following sections.
2.1. LightGBM Algorithm
LightGBM, a machine learning algorithm with the gradient boosting decision tree
(GBDT) algorithm, is a distributed gradient boosting framework based on a decision tree
algorithm [ 43], and iterative learning with a reduced loss function. During the iterative
computation, a weak learner is added to the strong learner in the previous learning process
to make the updated strong learner with the minimum loss function, and the updated
strong learner is as follows.
Ft(x)=ht(x)+Ft 1(x). (1)
The weak learner expression is as follows.
ht(x)=argmin
h2H√•Loss(y,Ft 1(x)+hx). (2)
The individual sample‚Äôs negative gradients are calculated as approximate residuals
each time the learner is updated.
rti= ¬∂Loss(y,Ft 1(xi))
¬∂Ft 1(xi). (3)
Theht(x)after Ô¨Åtting with the squared difference is as follows.
ht(x)=argmin
h2H√•(rti h(x))2, (4)
where ht(x)is the updated weak learner, Ft 1(x)is the strong learner before the update,
His the set consisting of all possible base learners, and argmin is the minimum value for
solving the loss function.
2.2. XGBoost Algorithm
XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient enhancement library and an integrated
learning model based on decision trees [ 44]. This model can improve the calculation of the
objective function based on gradient boosting, which transforms the optimization problem
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Sensors 2023 ,23, 6198 4 of 19
of the objective function into the minimization problem of the quadratic function and uses
the information of the second-order derivatives of the loss function to train the tree model
to improve the accuracy of the model. At the same time, the generalization performance of
the model is improved by adding the complexity of the tree as a regularization term to the
objective function. The objective function of XGBoost is calculated as follows.

tive function is calculated as follows.

ity,Kis the number of sample features, ft(xi)is the complexity of the decision tree where
the variable xiis located, Cis a constant, and giandhiare the Ô¨Årst-order and second-order
derivatives of the loss function, respectively.
2.3. SGDRegressor Algorithm
SGDRegressor is a regression algorithm that uses stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
to minimize the loss function and is suitable for handling large-scale datasets. Compared
with the traditional batch gradient descent, SGDRegressor approximates the E(w,b)true
gradient by considering only one training sample per iteration, resulting in an efÔ¨Åcient
training process [ 45]. Due to the stochastic nature of the decline, SGDRegressor requires
more iterations to reach the minimum, but it is still computationally inexpensive. Least
squares are used as a loss function to calculate the total squared error between the actual
data and the associated hyperplane. L2 regularization can improve the generalization
performance by applying a square penalty to the weight vector of the model and limiting
the complexity of the model. To improve the generalization ability of the model and avoid
overÔ¨Åtting, the L2 regularization term was introduced into the model. In this study, the
combination of the loss function and L2 regularization term was applied, thus balancing the
Ô¨Åt of the model on the training data, improving the generalization ability to unseen data,
and effectively reducing the overÔ¨Åtting problem. The loss function and the regularization
term are used to Ô¨Åt the regression model with the following equations.

2.4. Stacking Integration Algorithm
Ensemble learning is an approach to complete a learning task by constructing and
combining multiple learners. It Ô¨Årst generates a set of base learners and then combines them
through some learning strategy to output the Ô¨Ånal result [ 46]. Currently, ensemble learning
mainly includes homogeneous integration and heterogeneous integration. Bagging [ 47‚Äì49]
and boosting [ 44] are the most classical homogeneous integration methods. Homogeneous
integration patterns are highly correlated and prone to overÔ¨Åtting where the model over-Ô¨Åts
the training dataset. OverÔ¨Åtting can lead to a decrease in the generalization ability of the
model to the point where it does not generalize well to new, unseen data. In addition,
frequent application of averaging can lead to a homogeneous integration model that simply
linearizes the results of the base learner, from which it is difÔ¨Åcult to accurately reÔ¨Çect
the true diagnostic results. Heterogeneous integration primarily includes stacking [ 50].
The stacking algorithm is a typical representative of heterogeneous integration methods
and consists of two main layers of structure. Layer 1 is the base learner, which is used
to train and predict the original samples. Layer 2 is the meta-learner, which is used to
combine the diagnosis results of layer 1, to learn again, and perform the diagnosis. The high
diversity of heterogeneous integration methods has signiÔ¨Åcant algorithmic advantages,
thus outperforming the prediction performance of a single learner [ 51]. In this study,
LightGBM and XGBoost were used as base learners, and SGDRegressor was used as a
meta-learner, combined with a 5-fold cross-validation method to train each base learner
separately for integration, as shown in Figure 1.

2.5. Bayesian Tuning 
For the model, a suitable hyperparameter configuration can greatly improve its per-
formance. Commonly used tuni ng methods include the manual tuning method, random 
search method [52], and Bayesian tuning method [53]. The manual tuning method cannot 
find the best combination of parameters an d is time consuming. The random search 
method does not make full use of the a priori information. In contrast, the Bayesian tuning method can make full use of prior information to efficiently search for the optimal solution 
of hyperparameters in fewer iterations. Its ma in steps include setting the parameter search 
range, randomly generating the initial set of  candidate solutions, finding the next point 
based on these points, and repeating this step until the end of the iteration. Therefore, the 
Bayesian tuning method is chosen to automatically tune the parameters of the algorithm in the model training process of this study. 
The core of Bayesian optimization is the probabilistic agent model and the collection 
function. The probabilistic agent model is commonly used in Gaussian process regression, 
and the collection function is commonly used in probability of improvement (PI) [54]. The 
main idea is to use the posterior model to es timate the probability that the function value 
of an unknown point is greater than the existing maximum value, and take the point with 
the highest probability 
X‚àó as the next search point. The collection function formula is 
shown below.

the objective function of the Gaussian process, and ()xœÉ  represents its standard devia-
tion. 
2.6. Evaluation of the Model 
The coefficient of determination (R2) is a commonly used regression model predictor 
to measure the correlation between model pred ictions and actual resu lts. The value of R2 
ranges from [0, 1], and usually the closer the value is to 1, the better the predictive ability 
of the model, and vice versa [55].

(1) The original training set is divided into 5 subsets, denoted as D1‚ÄìD5;
(2) In the 1st cross-validation, D2‚ÄìD5 are input to the base learner as the training set,
and the trained base model is denoted as B1. D1 is input to B1 as the validation set D, and
the output is denoted as r1.
(3) This process is repeated. After reaching 5-fold cross-validation, 5 models (B1, B2,
B3, B4, B5) are trained, and 5 results (r1, r2, r3, r4, r5) are output, and the output results are
combined into a set and then averaged (R1).
(4) The test set is input into B1‚ÄìB5, and the output results are recorded as n1‚Äìn5, and
after taking the average value, they are recorded as N1.
(5) Finally, after the above 4 steps are executed for both of the 2 base models, the
diagnostic results R1 and R2 and the mean values N1 and N2 of the prediction results are
output. These two parts of the results are used as the training set and test set of the second
layer model, respectively, and the Ô¨Ånal results are output.

For the model, a suitable hyperparameter conÔ¨Åguration can greatly improve its per-
formance. Commonly used tuning methods include the manual tuning method, random

Ô¨Ånd the best combination of parameters and is time consuming. The random search method

and the collection function is commonly used in probability of improvement (PI) [ 54]. The
main idea is to use the posterior model to estimate the probability that the function value

cumulative density function of the standard normal cumulative distribution, f(x)is the
target value, f(x+)denotes the existing maximum value, m(x)represents the mean of the
objective function of the Gaussian process, and s(x)represents its standard deviation.
2.6. Evaluation of the Model
The coefÔ¨Åcient of determination (R2) is a commonly used regression model predictor
to measure the correlation between model predictions and actual results. The value of R2
ranges from [0, 1], and usually the closer the value is to 1, the better the predictive ability of
the model, and vice versa [55].

The root mean squared error (RMSE) is a commonly used metric to assess the predic-
tive performance of regression models and is interpretable to penalize the squared loss of
large deviations. A smaller value of RMSE indicates a smaller degree of difference between
the predicted and true values, thus indicating a better prediction of the model [ 56]. The

2.7. Pauta Criterion (3 s)
The Pauta criterion is a statistical method used to assess the dispersion and stability
of a dataset and can help to identify possible outliers. According to the 3 criterion, the
probability that a data point is within the interval (  ,+) is 0.6827, the probability
that a data point is within the interval (  2,+ 2) is 0.9544, and the probability that a
data point is within the interval (  3,+ 3) is 0.9974 [ 57]. Data points outside the range
indicate that there are possible outliers in these data points that require further examination
and analysis. In the fault diagnosis process of this study, the 3 criterion calculates speciÔ¨Åc
thresholds, and then an adaptive threshold method is proposed by combining the idea of
time-series sliding windows.
3. Modeling Methods for Troubleshooting
Firstly, the SCADA data were cleaned, and then the features were Ô¨Åltered by the
Pearson correlation coefÔ¨Åcient, Spearman correlation coefÔ¨Åcient, and variance selection,
and the LightGBM, XGBoost, and SGDRegressor models were constructed separately.
Finally, the stacking integrated model was constructed. This integrated model was applied
to predict the potential fault data by multi-objective regression and calculate the Ô¨Åtted
residuals to realize the fault diagnosis of multiple components of wind turbines; the
modeling process is shown in Figure 2.

In addition, the fault logging data includes 5 different types of faults (28 in total),
namely, GEARBOX, GENERATOR, GENERATOR_BEARING, HYDRAULIC_GROUP , and
TRANSFORMER. The data used in this study are mainly temperature data, and the tem-
perature data were collected by temperature sensors. Temperature sensors are used to
monitor the temperature of individual components to ensure proper system operation and
reduce thermal damage to critical components. There are speciÔ¨Åc requirements for the
installation location of temperature sensors. For example, generator temperature sensors
are usually installed on the stator and rotor to monitor the generator temperature; gearbox
temperature sensors are usually installed internally to monitor gear and bearing tempera-
tures; and transformer temperature sensors are usually installed on the heat sink or critical
components to ensure proper operating temperatures. However, not all types of faults can
be reÔ¨Çected by temperature changes. Therefore, GENERATOR, GENERATOR_BEARING,
and TRANSFORMER-type fault data should be used as the focus of the study for fault
diagnosis and are shown in Table 2.

3.2. Cleaning of Data
As shown in Table 3, there are a few missing values in some feature columns in the
dataset. To solve this problem, a forward interpolation method is used to Ô¨Åll in these
missing values. When the wind turbine is shut down, the data recorded by the SCADA
system may not reÔ¨Çect the actual generator status and performance. For example, the value
of the ‚ÄúGrd_Prod_PsblePwr_Avg‚Äù characteristic column has 0 or negative values, which
does not match the actual situation. Therefore, in order to ensure the accuracy of the data,
these invalid data need to be Ô¨Åltered and eliminated when performing troubleshooting or
performance evaluation, in order to avoid the impact on subsequent analysis and research.
The aim is to improve the reliability of the analysis results and to ensure that studies and
applications based on the SCADA data more accurately reÔ¨Çect the true operating status
of WTGs.

3.3. Filtering of Features
Three metrics, the Pearson correlation coefÔ¨Åcient, Spearman correlation coefÔ¨Åcient,
and variance, were used to screen the characteristics. Among them, the Pearson correlation
coefÔ¨Åcient is used to measure the linear correlation between two variables, which is obtained
by dividing the covariance by the standard deviation of the two variables. Although the
covariance can reÔ¨Çect the correlation degree of two random variables, its value is greatly
inÔ¨Çuenced by the magnitude, and the judgment of the correlation degree of variables
cannot be simply given from the numerical size of the covariance. To eliminate the effect
of this magnitude, the concept of the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient is introduced. The correlation
coefÔ¨Åcient is meaningful when the variance of both variables is not zero, and the correlation
coefÔ¨Åcient takes values in the range [  1, 1]. Usually, when the absolute values of the
characteristic variable and the target variable in the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient are less than 0.2,
the correlation can be considered as very low and directly excluded [ 59]. The Spearman
correlation coefÔ¨Åcient measures the nonlinear relationship between two variables and is
a nonparametric measure of rank correlation, which can be viewed as a nonparametric
version of the Pearson correlation. What is observed is the strength of the monotonic
relationship between the two, which, in layman‚Äôs terms, is the extent to which the two
keep in step with each other in terms of their tendency to become larger or smaller. When
the absolute value of the characteristic variable and the target variable in the correlation
coefÔ¨Åcient is less than 0.2, the correlation can be considered low and directly excluded [ 60].
The variance selection method Ô¨Årst calculates the variance of each feature, and then selects
the features with variance greater than the threshold value according to the threshold value,
and screens the features with a very high proportion of single values. Because when a
feature does not diverge, for example, the variance is close to 0, which means that the
sample basically does not differ in this feature, this feature is basically meaningless for
the differentiation of the sample. Generally, when the variance is less than 0.1, it can be
considered as an invalid feature and directly rejected [ 61]. The application of these methods
helps to improve the accuracy and validity of feature selection and ensure that the selected
features can better reÔ¨Çect the characteristics of the study object.
The model construction work for different fault types was processed relatively in-
dependently, so the feature screening process was also relatively independent. After
feature screening, 70 features were retained and 15.66% of the features were rejected for the
GENERATOR-type of unit T06. The GENERATOR_BEARING-type of the T07 unit retains
66 features and rejects 20.48% of the features; the TRANSFORMER-type of the T07 unit
retains 63 features and rejects 24.10% of the features. To ensure that features are selected
to meet the modeling needs and high-performance requirements for different fault types,
multiple target feature columns are also selected for each fault type in the SCADA data, as
shown in Table 4.

3.4. Division of Data
Based on the fault advance diagnosis time deÔ¨Åned by EDP , this study deÔ¨Ånes the
data before 60 days from the occurrence of the fault as the normal operation data of the
WTGs and sets their label as 0. The data 60 days before the occurrence of the fault is
deÔ¨Åned as the potential fault data of the WTGs and their label is set as 1. The interquartile
range (IQR) criterion was used to Ô¨Ålter the target characteristics from the normal operating
data to reduce the interference of outliers, thus improving the accuracy and robustness of
the model.
To meet the requirements, the datasets divided under the GENERATOR fault type
for unit T06, GENERATOR_BEARING fault type for unit T07, and TRANSFORMER fault
type for unit T07 were used to construct independent multi-objective regression models.
The SCADA data in each unit were divided into three parts: training set, validation set
and test set. Among them, the normal operation data were randomly divided into training
and validation sets in the ratio of 8:2, and the potential fault data were set as the test
set, as shown in Table 5. Each unit corresponds to a different fault type to ensure the
generalization performance and reliability of the model.

T07 TRANSFORMER (53,965, 63) (13,492, 63) (13,054, 63)
3.5. Construction of the Model
Python 3.8 and its third-party libraries were used to implement the code runs and
modeling. LightGBM, XGBoost, and SGDRegressor were integrated by stacking integrated
algorithms and multi-objective regression models were built for the diagnosis of each fault
type. To optimize the model performance, Bayesian tuning was applied and parameter
tuning was performed in the form of Ô¨Åve-fold cross-validation, with the number of calcu-
lations for the optimal parameter set to 30 to ensure better performance and reliability of
the model.
In the training process of the LightGBM single model, the max_depth, learning_rate,
and num_leaves parameters were tuned to Ô¨Ånd their optimal values. In the training process
of the XGBoost single model, max_depth, min_child_weight, learning_rate, gamma, and
subsample parameters were tuned to Ô¨Ånd their optimal values. In the training process of
the SGDRegressor single model, the parameters of the l1_ratio were tuned to Ô¨Ånd their
optimal values. Meanwhile, to eliminate the interference of different magnitudes on the
linear model training, the MinMaxScaler method was employed to normalize the entire
data, and each feature was scaled to between 0 and 1. After completing the training of the
three single models, the stacking integration framework was used, with LightGBM and
XGBoost as the base learners and SGDRegressor as the meta-learner, to train the integrated
model in the form of Ô¨Åve-fold cross-validation.
The results of the R2and RMSE evaluations of the multi-objective regression models
for different fault types are detailed in Tables 6‚Äì8. Since the test set is potential fault data,
the prediction effect is supposed to be poor, and its evaluation value should be signiÔ¨Åcantly
lower than that of the training and validation sets. The evaluation results of the validation
set show that the evaluated values of the four models corresponding to each fault type
are not signiÔ¨Åcantly different between the training and validation sets, indicating that the
overÔ¨Åtting degree of all models is small and meets the expected objectives. The stacking
integrated model has the best R2and RMSE results on the validation set, indicating that
the stacking integrated model has better prediction results compared to the single model.

4. Troubleshooting of Wind T urbines
The method of setting fault diagnosis thresholds for temperature varies in different
application scenarios and detection objects. Generally, Ô¨Åxed thresholds are obtained by
calculating the mean and standard deviation of temperature data over a period of time
based on the 3 criterion. However, with large temperature variations caused by the
working environment, the Ô¨Åxed-threshold method will not be able to make adaptive
adjustments, which can easily lead to false alarms. This study proposes an adaptive
thresholding method that fully integrates the idea of the 3 criterion and time-series sliding
window to calculate the mean value of residuals within each window, and the standard
deviation of residuals is obtained by the validation set calculation. The residual standard
deviation is then obtained by subtracting the residual mean from the validation set for each
sliding window.
The fitted residual curves for the three temperature measurement points corresponding to
GENERATOR (Gen_Phase1_Temp_Avg, Gen_Phase2_Temp_Avg, and Gen_Phase3_Temp_Avg)
are shown in Figure 3. By Ô¨Åtting the residual data, a Ô¨Åxed threshold value of 14.0701
is calculated. Obviously, the residual data of the validation set does not exceed this
threshold value and no alarm phenomenon occurs. The Ô¨Åtted residual curves for the
three temperature measurement points (Gen_Phase1_Temp_Avg, Gen_Phase2_Temp_Avg,
Gen_Phase3_Temp_Avg) of the GENERATOR test set are shown in Figure 4. Among them,
compared with the other two measurement points, the Ô¨Åtted residuals of the measurement
point ‚ÄúGen_Phase2_Temp_Avg‚Äù increased abnormally at around 10:00 pm on 23 July 2016.
Based on this abnormal phenomenon, troubleshooting was performed for the abnormal
time period of this measurement point.

 4. Troubleshooting of Wind Turbines 
The method of setting fault diagnosis thresholds for temperature varies in different 
application scenarios and detection objects. Generally, fixed thresholds are obtained by 
calculating the mean and standard deviation of  temperature data over  a period of time 
based on the 3 œÉ criterion. However, with large temperature variations caused by the 
working environment, the fixed-threshold method  will not be able to make adaptive ad-
justments, which can easily lead to false alarms. This study proposes an adaptive thresh-
olding method that fully integrates the idea of the 3 œÉ criterion and time-series sliding 
window to calculate the mean value of residuals within each window, and the standard 
deviation of residuals is obtained by the valida tion set calculation. The residual standard 
deviation is then obtained by subtracting th e residual mean from the validation set for 
each sliding window.

ing to GENERATOR (Gen_Phase1_Temp_Avg, Gen_Phase2_Temp_Avg, and

threshold value of 14.0701 is ca lculated. Obviously, the residual  data of the validation set 
does not exceed this threshold value and no al arm phenomenon occurs. The fitted residual

Figure 8. Troubleshooting results of unit T07 in th e abnormal time of the GENERATOR_BEARING 
measurement point. 
The fitted residual curves for unit T07 at  the three temperature measurement points 
corresponding to the TRANSFORMER validation set (HVTrafo_Phase1_Temp_Avg, HVTrafo_Phase2_Temp_Avg, HVTrafo_Phase3_Temp_Avg) are shown in Figure 9. The 
fixed threshold value of 21.5524 is calculated from the fitted residual data. It can be seen 
that the residual data of the validation set does not exceed this threshold value and no 
alarm phenomenon occurs. The fitted residual curves of unit T07 for the three temperature 
measurement points corresponding to the TRANSFORMER test set 
(HVTrafo_Phase1_Temp_Avg,HVTrafo_Pha se2_Temp_Avg,HVTrafo_Phase3_Temp_A

‚ÄúHVTrafo_Phase3_Temp_Avg‚Äù increased abnormally at the time point ‚Äú28 June 2016 19:00‚Äù. Based on this abnormal phenomenon, troubleshooting was conducted for the ab-
normal time period of this measurement point.

As shown in Table 2, unit T07 has a TRAN SFORMER-type fault recorded at the time 
point ‚Äú10 July 2016 3:46‚Äù. Among them, the fault diagnosis results of unit T07 at the ab-
normal time of the ‚ÄúHVTrafo_Phase3_Temp_Avg‚Äù measurement point are shown in Fig-
ure 11. In the fault diagnosis for the abnormal time period of this measurement point, the fixed-threshold alarm time point is ‚Äú28 June 2016 23:00‚Äù and the adaptive-threshold alarm 
time point is ‚Äú28 June 2016 20:00‚Äù. Both thre shold alarm time points are earlier than the 
fault recording point, and the adaptive-threshold alarm time is 3.0 h earlier than the fixed-threshold alarm time.

In summary, both fixed and adaptive thresholds advance the alarm ahead of the fault 
recording time point, as shown in Table 9. However, adaptive-threshold diagnosis has 
better results in terms of early alarms. Among them, the GENERATOR fault type is 1.5 h 
ahead, the GENERATOR_BEARING fault type  is about 5.8 h ahead, and the TRANS-
FORMER fault type is 3.0 h ahead. Therefore, it can be seen that the adaptive-threshold 
diagnosis method proposed in this study has been effectively verified in practical appli-
cations.

5. Conclusions
In this study, a multi-objective regression method based on SCADA temperature data
is proposed, aiming at scientiÔ¨Åc diagnosis and accurate alarm of wind turbine problems.
The method employs the LightGBM, XGBoost, SGDRegressor, and stacking integrated
algorithms to construct multiple regression models and perform fault diagnosis by Ô¨Åtting
the variation trend of residuals. The Pearson correlation coefÔ¨Åcient, Spearman correlation
coefÔ¨Åcient, and variance selection were adopted to achieve data feature screening, and
multiple target temperature features corresponding to the actual needs of different com-
ponents were selected. To further optimize the model performance, the Bayesian tuning
method was introduced in this study to improve the generalization ability and prediction
performance of the model. In addition, the 3 criterion and the temporal sliding window
were applied to propose an adaptive-threshold fault precision diagnosis and alarm method.
The application of this method for fault diagnosis Ô¨Ånds that this aspect achieves good
results in the fault diagnosis of three components, i.e., the generator, generator bearing,
and transformer, showing certain applicability.
In addition, a WTG is a nonlinear multi-coupled system with complex interactions
between different components. Therefore, how to use SCADA data to improve the compre-
hensive fault diagnosis of multiple components of WTGs is still a topic worthy of in-depth
research. Optimization of the model‚Äôs performance and improvement of the training
speed are the key points of future research. How to further analyze the fault correlation
among wind turbine components and how to improve the accuracy and robustness of fault
diagnosis methods need to be further explored.
