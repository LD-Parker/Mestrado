The number of normal samples of wind turbine generators is much larger than the number
of fault samples. To solve the problem of imbalanced classi ﬁcation in wind turbine
generator fault detection, a cost-sensitive extremely randomized trees (CS-ERT)algorithm is proposed in this paper, in which the cost-sensitive learning method isintroduced into an extremely randomized trees (ERT) algorithm. Based on theclassi ﬁcation misclassi ﬁcation cost and class distribution, the misclassi ﬁcation cost gain
(MCG) is proposed as the score measure of the CS-ERT model growth process to improvethe classi ﬁcation accuracy of minority classes. The Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion
lasso (HSICLasso) feature selection method is used to select strongly correlated non-redundant features of doubly-fed wind turbine generators. The effectiveness of the methodwas veri ﬁed by experiments on four different failure datasets of wind turbine generators.
The experiment results show that average missing detection rate, average misclassi ﬁcation
cost and gMean of the improved algorithm better than those of the ERT algorithm. Inaddition, compared with the CSForest, AdaCost and MetaCost methods, the proposedmethod has better real-time fault detection performance.

INTRODUCTION
The global capacity of installed wind turbine generators in 2019 reached 60.4 GW, with an annual
increment of 19% ( Kandukuri et al., 2016 ). The operation and maintenance costs of wind turbine
generators account for approximately 15 –30% of their total cost ( Artigao et al., 2018 ). Generator
failures account for approximately 4% of total failures, and generator fault identi ﬁcation has attracted
considerable attention in recent years ( Chen et al., 2016 ;Quiroz et al., 2018 ;Lei et al., 2019 ). Failures
in the generator may cause the whole mechanical system to stop functioning, reduce the operationefﬁciency of the wind turbine and even cause personnel casualties. Wind turbine generators,
intermittent operating conditions, and severe weather pose challenges to the safe operation ofwind turbines ( Judge et al., 2019 ). Since the generator is the critical component of the wind turbine,
wind turbine failure detection can greatly reduce the operation and maintenance costs by reducingunplanned failures ( Willis et al., 2018 ;Yang et al., 2021 ).Edited by:

Fault detection methods can be divided into two categories:
model-based methods ( Cho et al., 2018 ;Habibi et al., 2019 ) and
data-based methods ( Mingzhu et al., 2020 ;Liming and Bo, 2020 ;
Song et al., 2021 ). Model-based fault detection methods include a
parameter estimation method ( Pan et al., 2017 ), state estimation
methods ( Shahriari et al., 2020 ;Ghahremani and Kamwa, 2016 ),
and an equivalent space method ( Bakri and Boumhidi, 2018 ).
Bakri et al. proposed a model-based fault detection and isolationtechnology to solve the early fault detection problem of windturbines ( Bakri and Boumhidi, 2018 ).These methods can
comprehensively examine the essence of dynamic systems forreal-time fault detection. However, the structure of wind turbinesis complex, with many characteristic parameters, and model-based methods have dif ﬁculty obtaining accurate models.
Data-based methods include signal-based methods, statistical
analysis-based methods, and machine learning-based methods.
Fernandez-Canti et al. proposed a wind turbine fault detectionmethod based on the hybrid Bayesian set membership method(Fernandez-Canti et al., 2015 ). This method only uses the non-
fault behavior model to generate the consistency index and thefault indicator, and detects whether the wind turbine fails byanalyzing the noise of the equipment. It is dif ﬁcult for methods
based on statistical analysis to detect the fault of a combination ofsignal distortion and signal fading. Ibrahim et al. proposed amethod based on an effective extended Kalman ﬁlter to iteratively
estimate a fault signature component (FSC) and track its
amplitude to realize fault detection in wind turbine generators
(Ibrahim et al., 2018 ). The state characteristic signal is weak at the
initial stage of the fault, which makes it dif ﬁcult to accurately
detect generator faults by the signal-based method.
Machine learning-based methods —for instance, arti ﬁcial
neural networks (ANNs) ( Marugan et al., 2018 ;Hamidreza
et al., 2014 ), support vector machines ( Zeng et al., 2019 ;Li Z.
M. et al., 2019 ), decision trees ( Yu et al., 2018 ), bagging ( Breiman,
1996 ), boosting ( Cheki et al., 2016 ), and random forests (RFs) ( Li
et al., 2016 ;Joshuva and Sugumaran, 2017 )—are often applied to
solve binary classi ﬁcation problems. These methods can
effectively predict the operating state of a wind turbine. Chun
et al. used RF learning to evaluate the correlation betweencharacteristic variables and target variables and then used adeep neural network (DNN) model to identify wind turbinepermanent magnet drop failures. However, DNNs arecomputationally complex and easily over ﬁt data ( Teng et al.,
2018 ). Gao et al. used the integrated extended load mean
decomposition multiscale entropy method to extract featuresand then applied the least square support vector machine(LSSVM) method to perform wind turbine fault detection(Gao et al., 2018 ). The LSSVM method achieved strong fault
detection performance but poor real-time performance when
processing big data. Gopinath proposed a method for windturbine fault detection that combines nuisance attributeprojection and the classi ﬁcation and regression tree (CART)
algorithm ( Gopinath et al., 2016 ). Disturbance attribute
projection was used to extract the frequency domain statistical
characteristics of the current signal, and CART was used as adecision model to realize synchronous generator fault detection.Although a decision tree method has various advantages, such asa simple structure, strong real-time performance, and the ability
to handle big data, a single decision tree is impractical. Li et al.adopted the short-term memory network of the residualgenerator and used an RF to build a detection model ( Li M.
et al., 2019 ). This method can effectively detect early faults of
wind turbines in harsh environments. The RF model improvesthe generalization ability viaintegration.
In the actual operation of wind turbines, the number of fault
samples is much smaller than the number of normal samples,which is characteristic of typical imbalanced classi ﬁcation
problems ( Malik and Mishra, 2016 ;Buda et al., 2018 ;Longting
et al., 2019 ). Traditional fault detection methods perform poorly
when applied to imbalanced data. For class-imbalancedproblems, cost-sensitive learning combines misclassi ﬁcation
costs and traditional fault detection methods. By introducing
different types of cost functions to characterize the importance of
a sample, the objective function is transformed from one designedto maximize the classi ﬁcation accuracy into one designed to
minimize the misclassi ﬁcation cost. For example, the cost-
sensitive decision tree algorithm has been widely used inindustrial control processes and detection ( Tan, 1993 ;Lomax
and Vadera, 2013 ;Kim et al., 2018 ). Because the test cost and
misclassi ﬁcation cost of cost-sensitive learning are often similar
in scale, Zhang et al. presented a multiscale cost-sensitive decisiontree algorithm that combines the misclassi ﬁcation cost and test
cost. The approach solves the problem of integrating multiple
costs together in cost-sensitive learning ( Zhang, 2018 ). Qi et al.
proposed a cost-sensitive decision tree algorithm thatincorporates data cleaning algorithms to address poor-qualitydata, including the high cleaning cost ( Qi et al., 2019 ). However, a
single classi ﬁer easily leads to over ﬁtting when considering
complex industrial problems and the poor modelgeneralization ability.
Ensemble learning combines multiple classi ﬁers to obtain
better performance than that achieved by a single classi ﬁer.
Tree ensemble algorithms can be classi ﬁed as either boosting
or bagging. Masnadi-Shirazi et al. presented a cost-sensitive
framework suitable for AdaBoost, RealBoost, and LogitBoost
for class-imbalanced problems ( Masnadi-Shirazi and
Vasconcelos, 2011 ). Furthermore, Zelenkov et al. proposed a
sample-based cost-sensitive adaptive boosting algorithm(Zelenkov, 2019 ) in which the misclassi ﬁcation cost and
sample distributions are combined, and the cost matrix of thesample is corrected based on the training set to improve theoverall performance. Because the boosting algorithm uses serialdependence, it is dif ﬁcult to train data in parallel. The cost-
sensitive RF algorithm uses a parallel approach and has stronggeneralization capabilities ( Nami and Shajari, 2018 ;Siers and
Islam, 2015 ). Siers et al. combined cost-sensitive parameters with
an RF model, introduced misclassi ﬁcation costs when building
models, and implemented a cost-sensitive forest (CSForest)algorithm based on a decision tree ( Siers and Islam, 2015 ). Lu
et al. embedded the cost of misclassi ﬁcation, test cost and
rejection cost into a rotating forest algorithm ( Lu et al., 2017 ),
which was transformed into a cost-sensitive problem to
effectively reduce the classi ﬁcation cost and improve the
effectiveness of the algorithm. However, the computational

complexity of the cost-sensitive RF algorithm is high. Geurts et al.
proposed an extremely randomized trees (ERT) algorithm basedon the RF algorithm ( Geurts et al., 2006 ). By adding random
disturbances when nodes are split, the model achieves stronger
generalization ability and reduced computational complexity.
Moreover, each base classi ﬁer uses the complete training
dataset for training, which reduces the variance of the ERTalgorithm.
Although the ERT algorithm has faster calculation speed and
smaller prediction variance ( Geurts et al., 2006 ), the problem of
low detection accuracy of failure samples still exists forunbalanced data. For the imbalance problem, many cost-sensitive fault detection methods based on tree ensemblealgorithms have been proposed and have made certainachievements in the ﬁeld of wind turbine generator fault
detection. However, these methods make it dif ﬁcult to meet
both high performance and high real-time requirements.Therefore, this paper proposes a wind turbine generator faultdetection method based on cost-sensitive extremely randomizedtrees (CS-ERT). The main contributions of this paper are asfollows:
To solve the class imbalance problem in the actual operationof wind turbine generators, cost sensitive learning wasintroduced into the ERT algorithm, and the CS-ERTalgorithm was proposed to detect the fault of wind
turbine generators. The objective function of the
algorithm was transformed from minimizing classi ﬁcation
error to minimizing misclassi ﬁcation cost. The proposed
method was veri ﬁed by the data of 1.5 MW doubly-fed wind
turbine generators.
The HSICLasso feature selection method was used toremove weak correlation features to address the highfeature dimension problem of wind turbine generators. Afeature subset composed of strongly correlated non-redundant variables was used to train the faultdetection model.
EXTREMELY RANDOMIZED TREES
ERT ( Geurts et al., 2006 ) is an ensemble algorithm with high
randomness in which a set of nonpruned decision trees isestablished via a top-down process. In contrast to the RFalgorithm, bagging is not used by the ERT model to train eachbasic classi ﬁer. Each tree of ERT uses the complete training
samples for learning to minimize the deviation in the model.
In the traditional ensemble method, the best feature and cut-point of a node are obtained by evaluating the Gini coef ﬁcient,
Shannon entropy of each feature value of each feature, etc. ERT isdifferent.
Given the dataset D (X, Y), the m-dimensional vector f
i
represents the feature vector of the sample xi. In the extreme
decision tree splitting process, a value ak
cis randomly selected
from the maximum ak
maxto the minimum ak
minfor attribute k as
the cut-point of this feature. Then, the score measure of feature kis calculated according to Eq. 1 .Score
c(k,S)/equals2Ik
c(S)
Hk(S)+Hc(S)(1)
where Ik
c(S)represents the mutual information of the two subsets
with respect to the class after node S is split according to attribute k
and cut-point ak
c.Hk(S)represents the split entropy of attribute k.
Hc(S)represents the information entropy of node S. Each candidate
feature of the node is traversed according to the above method, andthe feature and cut-point with the largest score measure Score
c(k,S)
are selected to split the node. Then, the samples with a value offeature k less than the cut-point are placed in the left leaf node, andthe remaining samples are placed in the right leaf node. The abovesteps are repeated recursively until the stop splitting condition issatisﬁed. The simplicity of the tree growth process makes the space
complexity of ERT lower than that of other ensemble methods.
Theﬁnal result of the ERT algorithm is determined by voting
by all base classi ﬁers, as follows.

where Mis the total number of trees, fiis the feature vector of
sample xi, and Ptrepresents the conditional probability that the
sample belongs to class c under the condition of vector fi. For
regression problems, Eq. 2 deﬁnes the classi ﬁcation probability of
the sample. For classi ﬁcation problems, the voting method is used
to make decisions according to Eq. 3 . In the fault detection
method, Eq. 3 is used to realize the fault detection of the sample.
COST-SENSITIVE EXTREMELY
RANDOMIZED TREES
In this section, the CS-ERT algorithm is proposed, and the
computational complexity of the algorithm is analyzed.
The Principle of Cost-Sensitive Extremely
Randomized Trees
CS-ERT is a derivative of the ERT algorithm. CS-ERT combines
cost-sensitive learning with the ERT algorithm, which solves theproblem of low accuracy in the failure samples of traditional ERTTABLE 1 | Cost matrix of two classi ﬁcation problems.

Note that C FNis the cost of predicting the fault sample as a normal class, C FPis the cost
of predicting the normal sample as a fault class, and C TNand C TPrepresent the cost of
correct detection. The larger the misclassi ﬁcation cost parameters, the more important
the classi ﬁcation. For practical wind turbine generators, the economic losses caused by
false negatives are far greater than those caused by missing detection. Therefore, themisclassi ﬁcation cost parameter C
FNof the fault class is greater than the misclassi ﬁcation
cost parameter C FPof the normal class (C FN>CFP).

algorithms in imbalanced data. The cost matrix is introduced to
represent the misclassi ﬁcation cost in the fault detection ﬁeld, as
shown in Table 1 .
The CS-ERT algorithm is composed of multiple cost-sensitive
extreme decision trees (CS-EDT). Each CS-EDT model has a
chain structure similar to a decision tree, which includes a ﬁnite
set and edge set that constitute the root node, branch nodes andleaf nodes, as shown in Figure 1 .
InFigure 1 , Ni represents the i-th node. If Ni is a branch node,
the cut-point is randomly selected for each feature of the node. Tosolve the problem of category imbalance, this paper proposes theMCG as the score measure of the branch node. The MCG G
kfor
attribute k is de ﬁned as follows:
Gk/equalsC/parenleftbigparent node/parenrightbig−NL
NL+NRC/parenleftbigleftchild node/parenrightbig
−NR
NL+NRC/parenleftbigright child node/parenrightbig (4)where C(parent node )represents the misclassi ﬁcation cost of the
parent node; C(leftchild node )andC(right child node )are the
misclassi ﬁcation costs of the left and right child nodes,
respectively; and NLand NRrepresent the numbers of the left
and right child nodes, respectively. According to Eq. 4 , the
misclassi ﬁcation cost gain is calculated for each candidate
feature. Then, the attribute and random value with the largestMCG is selected as the split feature and cut-point of thebranch node.
The MCG is essentially the difference between the
misclassi ﬁcation cost of the parent node and the weighted sum
of the costs of all child nodes. The misclassi ﬁcation cost of the leaf
node is deﬁned as follows:
C(node )/equalsC
P+CN (5)
where CPis the cost of the fault class at node , and CNis the cost of
the normal class at node , as shown in Eqs. 6 ,7:

number of missing detection samples. NTPand NTNare the
numbers of samples correctly predicted as faults and normal,respectively. As shown in Table 1 ,C
FN,CFP,CTNandCTPare the
misclassi ﬁcation cost parameters.
The score measure of the branch node is affected by the sample
distribution. Thus, to reduce the impact of class imbalance, theclass distribution is added to the calculation of themisclassi ﬁcation cost function. In addition, C
TPand CTNare
usually regarded as zero in industry. The expression of themisclassi ﬁcation cost function is as follows:
C

where pP/equalsNP/(NP+NN)represents the proportion of faulty
samples in the node, and pN/equalsNN/(NP+NN)is the
proportion of normal samples in the node. NPand NNare
the numbers of samples classi ﬁed as faults and normal,
respectively.
IfNiis a leaf node in Figure 1 , according to Bayes ’theorem,
the classi ﬁcation with the minimized misclassi ﬁcation cost is
selected as the category of the leaf node. The de ﬁnition is as

The CS-ERT model is developed through generating sample

D(X, Y) is the dataset, where X/equals[x
1,x2,... ,xm]is the

The Computational Complexity of
Cost-Sensitive Extremely Randomized Trees
The computational complexity of the RF algorithm is O(M(mnlogn)),
where Mrepresents the number of base classi ﬁers,mrepresents the
number of features, and nrepresents the number of samples.
Compared with RFs, the CS-ERT algorithm introducesrandomness in the process of tree growth. When a node selects asplit feature, a random value for each feature is used as the cut-pointfor that attribute. Therefore, the computational complexity of CS-EDT
isO(mlogn ), and the computational complexity of the CS-ERT
algorithm is O(M(mlogn )), according to (11). The CS-ERT
algorithm has better re al-time performance.
WIND TURBINE GENERATOR FAULT
DETECTION
In wind turbine generator fault detection, there are generally two
types of erroneous predictions: 1) missed detection, where a

system in the fault state is predicted to be working normally, and
2) false alarm, where a system in the normal working state ispredicted to be in a fault state. Clearly, the economic loss causedby missed detection is far greater than the loss caused by falsealarms. CS-ERT can be used for fault detection of wind turbine
generators to minimize the missing detection rate.
To provide a clearer structure, this section introduces three
evaluation indicators for fault detection in advance. The missingdetection rate, average misclassi ﬁcation cost, and gMean are
abbreviated as MDR, AMC, and gMean, respectively. Theevaluation index calculation equation is as follows.

Referring to Eqs 12 ,13TPrepresents true positives, FN

matrices. In Eq 14 ,Recall /equalsTP /(TP+FN)represents the
probability of correct detection of fault samples, and Specificity /equals
TN /(TN +FP)represents the probability of correct detection of
normal samples. The MDR refers to the ratio of the number ofmissed detection samples to the total number of samples when thewind turbine generator fails. The AMC considers not only the failurerecognition rate but also the case where the misclassi ﬁcation cost is
unequal. The gMean refers to the square root of the product of thefailure detection rate and the normal detection rate, which is typicallyused as an evaluation of performance for class-imbalanced problems.The running time is closely related to the computational complexity of
the algorithm. In this experiment, the running time is the mean value
of the model ’s 10-fold cross-validation.
Figure 3 is aﬂowchart of a fault detection method based on the
CS-ERT model. Of ﬂine wind turbine generator data are ﬁrstcollected from the SCADA database, and data cleaning is
performed. Data cleaning includes normalization and removal ofmissing and null values. Expert experience and the HSICLassomethod are used to select features and generate feature subsets toavoid the impact of weakly correlated features and redundant
features on the fault detection performance. In addition, the
ofﬂine data are divided into a train dataset and a validation
dataset. The train set is used to train the CS-ERT model. Thevalidation dataset is used to adjust the hyperparameters of the modeland initially evaluate the performance of the model. The optimalhyperparameters of the CS-ERT model are obtained throughofﬂine data, and the CS-ERT model with optimal parameters is
established according to the opt imal hyperparameters. In the
last step, wind turbine data is collected online, and datapreprocessing is performed. The processed online data arethen used as the input for the optimal CS-ERT model, which
is used to predict the real-time working status of wind turbine
generators. If a fault is predicted, an alarm is triggered. Finally,the performance of the fault detection model on online data isanalyzed according to Eqs 12 –14.
The pseudocode of the large-scale wind turbine generator fault
detection method based on CS-ERT is described as follows.Algorithm 2 represents the process of obtaining the optimal
CS-ERT model on the of ﬂine dataset. Algorithm 3 realizes online
fault detection of wind turbine generators.

mechanical energy, and generators convert mechanical energy
into electrical energy. The electrical energy generated by thegenerator is integrated into the power grid throughcomponents such as converters, power cabinets and transformers.
The research object of this paper is a doubly-fed wind turbine
generator. The doubly-fed wind turbine generator is mainlycomposed of a generator and a cooling system. The generatoris composed of a stator, a rotor, a bearing, etc. The stator windingof the generators is directly connected to the power grid, and therotor winding is connected to the power grid through a frequencyconverter. The equipment realizes variable-speed and constant-frequency power generation, which meets the requirements of thegrid connection. Due to the AC excitation characteristics, thedoubly-fed wind turbine can accurately adjust the output voltageof the generator by adjusting the excitation current. However, the
power factor of doubly-fed wind turbines is low and requires
additional power compensation. Therefore, in order to ensure thenormal operation of the wind turbine, it is very important toperform fault detection on the generator.
Four kinds of defects (i.e., generator winding temperature error
(F1), generator bearing temperature error (F2), generator fanpump heater protection error (F3) and generator brush error(F4) are generated in the actual operation of the generator.Table 2 shows the fault mechanism and sensitive parameters of
the four types of faults of the generator. The failure mechanismindicates the cause of the failure. Sensitive parameters are features
that have a greater impact on faults through manual analysis. Wind
turbine generator data are obtained from the SCADA database.Each sample has 213 features. The starting sampling point is half anhour before the start of a fault. The ending sampling point is half anhour after the end of a fault, and the data sampling interval is 2 s.
Data cleaning methods include missing value processing
outlier value processing, and commonly used methods such asthe deletion method and data repair method. To solve thisproblem, this paper adopts the deletion method to clean thedata. This experiment was conducted on the Python 3.6 platform.The multi-duplicated samples and the samples with missing and
null values were removed from the dataset. This method can not
only reduce the in ﬂuence of noise on the model performance, but
also reduce the data diversity. Furthermore, features that have all0 values were removed to reduce the dimensionality of the featurespace and the model. To ensure the comparability of each feature,z-score normalization was used to eliminate the dimensionality ofeach feature. The value of each feature was transformed into adimensionless value in the interval [0, 1].

Experimental Results and Analysis
In accordance with the procedure of Figure 3 , the HSICLasso
method is used to select the features of the wind turbine generatorsdataset. The HSICLasso feature selection method ( Yamada et al.,
2014 ) is a derived algorithm of the least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (lasso) ( Tibshirani, 1996 ). We use non-negative
constraints on αto improve the algorithm ’s ability to select
effective features. In addition, the Gaussian kernel function and
the triangular kernel function are used on the input vector andoutput vector of HSICLasso, respectively. We can incorporatestructured outputs via kernels. Ren et al. (2020) proved that
HSICLasso can effectively analyze the nonlinear relationshipbetween multivariate time series. The F-norm replaces the L2-norm. The HSICLasso algorithm is de ﬁned as follows.

method is extended to the high-dimensional feature selection
problem. For massive high-dimensional data, the Gaussiankernel in HSIC Lasso is computationally expensive. Yamada

The wind turbine generator dataset contains a large number of
nonlinear and nonfunctional relationships. The high-dimensionalfeature space entails a large amount of calculation and low real-
time performance for fault detection. The non-redundant features
that have a strong correlation with the output vector are extracted
based on expert experience and HSICLasso feature selection.Yamada et al. (2018) used the HSICLasso feature selection

method for ultrahigh-dimensional big data nonlinear feature
selection and achieved good results. The features with the top 8are selected as inputs for the wind turbine generator fault detectionmodel. The feature selection results are as follows.
According to Table 3 , the winding temperature, bearing
temperature, and cooling air temperature are strongly correlatedin the four fault datasets, consistent with the failure mechanismand sensitive parameters in Table 2 . Therefore, the HSICLasso
feature selection method can accurately extract attribute subsetsfrom wind turbine generator data. The feature dimensions, faulttypes, and sample imbalance of the dataset after applying the
HSICLasso feature selection method are shown in Table 4 .

Comparison Among Different Methods
In this subsection, comparative studies among different methodsare performed to verify the ef ﬁcacy and superiority of the
proposed algorithm. According to the procedure mentioned inExperimental Results and Analysis , different features are
extracted to form four feature sets of four faults, and then
these feature sets are input to the model to identify windturbine generator faults. To evaluate the effectiveness of theCS-ERT fault detection method, three points should beemphasized. First, nonredundant features with strongcorrelation are selected via the HSICLasso method to reducethe feature dimensionality. Then, the parameters of differentclassi ﬁers are selected based on grid optimization for each
dataset. Finally, the experiment compares RF ( Hsu et al., 2020 ;
Jia et al., 2018 ) with XGBoost ( Zhang et al., 2018 ), ERT ( Janssens
et al., 2016 ), CS-EDT (base classi ﬁer for CS-ERT), MetaCost ( Kim
et al., 2012 ), AdaCost ( Yin et al., 2013 ), CSForest ( Siers and Islam,
2015 ), and CS-ERT. To eliminate the contingency of the
experiment, all methods use the 10-fold cross-validationmethod. During performance analysis, MDR, gMean, AMDand Time are used to evaluate the performance of the model.TABLE 3 | HSICLasso feature selection results.

A higher gMean and lower MDR, AMC, and Time indicate better
performance of the fault detection method.
Figures 5 ,6represent the diagnosis results of different fault
detection methods for the four faul ts of the wind turbine generator.
As observed in Figures 5 ,6, the MDR (average MDR is 0.45%) and
AMC (average AMC is 0.41%) of the proposed method are muchlower than those of other fault detection methods in the four fault
types. We can also see that the missing detection rate and average
misclassi ﬁcation cost of traditional fault detection methods are
higher than those based on cost-sensitive fault detection methods.The MDR and AMC of ERT, RF and XGBoost methods are allgreater than 20 and 10%. Moreover, missing detection rate andAMCs below 20 and 10%, respectively, are attained by the cost-sensitive methods. This means that cost-sensitive fault detectionmethods give a higher misclassi ﬁcation cost to minority classes
when dealing with imbalanced data than traditional methods(ERT, RF, XGBoost). Furthermore, it helps reduce the falsenegative rate and average misclassi ﬁcation cost of fault
detection methods. Namely, the superiority of the cost-
sensitive method is con ﬁrmed through experimental analysis.
The average MDR and average AMC of CS-EDT are 23.54 and
8.07%, respectively. The performance of CS-ERT is obviouslybetter than that of CS-EDT, which proves the necessity andadvantage of adopting the ensemble algorithm. In addition,Figures 5 .6show that the average MDR and average AMC of
the CS-ERT method are 0.45 and 0.41%, respectively, on the fourtypes of faults of wind turbine generators. The average MDRs ofother cost-sensitive methods —namely, MetaCost, AdaCost and
CSForest —are 11.67, 15.18, and 9.14%, respectively, and the
average AMCs are 6.24, 6.37, and 3.97%, respectively. The
results demonstrate the ef ﬁcacy and bene ﬁts of the CS-ERT
classi ﬁer. The HSICLasso feature extraction method is proved to
effectively reduce the impact of weakly correlated features andredundant features on model performance. This proves thesuperiority of the proposed method for fault detection on windturbine generators.
To further analyze the effectiveness of the proposed method,
gMean is used as an indicator to evaluate the performance of theabove fault detection method. The experimental results are shown
inFigure 7 . The gMean value is composed of the missing
detection rate and the false alarm rate. It is mostly used formodel performance evaluation when addressing imbalanced dataand can effectively evaluate the performance of the model. Theexperimental results show that the average gMean of theproposed method is 99.68%, which is higher than the gMean
value of the other 7 methods (70.48, 70.83, 73.15, 83.36, 93.53,
92.06, and 93.92%). This shows that while the method improvesthe failure detection rate, it also maintains a high false alarm rate.There are several reasons that could explain this: First, comparedwith the standard ERT algorithm, CS-ERT considers the cost ofmisclassi ﬁcation to improve the detection accuracy of fault
classes. Then, compared with CSForest, the proposed methoduses complete features for training and can make more reliabledecisions. In addition, it reduces the interference of weaklycorrelated features and improves model performance.Therefore, we can conclude that the proposed method
achieves the best classi ﬁcation performance in this experiment.
In wind turbine generator fault detection, the running time of
the model is also an important index. How to meet both highfault detection performance and short running time has alwaysbeen a research hotspot ( Barrios Aguilar et al., 2020 ;Falehi,
2020 ).The objective function of CS-ERT only focuses on fault
detection performance compared to the multiple objectiveoptimization approach. The advantage of the running time isreﬂected in its unique structure. The above methods are used to
process the generator fault dataset and record its running time.The result is shown in Figure 8 . Each method sets
hyperparameters with the goal of optimal performance. The
average calculation time of the CS-ERT method is 0.646 s, whichis shorter than the calculation times of MetaCost, AdaCost andCSForest (1.941, 1.787, and 3.425 s, respectively). The runningtime on the 4 datasets is better than those of these threea l g o r i t h m s .T h er e a s o nf o rt h i sr e s u l ti st h a tC S - E R Trandomly selects a value for each feature, reducing one levelof looping in the model. The average computation time of CS-EDT is 0.21 s, which is lower than that of the CS-ERT algorithm,
FIGURE 8 | Comparison of the running time for the eight algorithms on the four datasets.

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
which veri ﬁes that the ensemble algorithm increases the
computational complexity while improving the modelperformance. The average calculation times of the XGBoost,RF and ERT methods are 0.141, 0.036, and 0.021 s, respectively.
Although the calculation speed of traditional algorithms is
faster, they do not consider the cost of misclassi ﬁcation. This
leads to a low failure detection rate, which seriously affects theeconomic bene ﬁts of the wind turbine.
In summary, the CS-ERT-based wind turbine generator fault
detection method has the performance of low MDR, low AMCand high gMean in four kinds of generator faults. Compared withMetaCost, AdaCost and CSForest, the proposed method has afaster calculation advantage.
CONCLUSION
A generator is one of the energy conversion components of adoubly fed wind turbine. The long time operation results in thegenerator fault data are far less than the normal data. To deal withthis problem, we proposed a novel method (CS-ERT) for windturbine generator fault detection with imbalanced data in thispaper. First, the HSICLasso feature selection method is used to
select strongly correlated non-redundant features to form feature
subsets to reduce the dimension of the dataset. Then, the faultdetection model of doubly-fed wind turbine generators based onCS-ERT is established. Finally, the feature subset is used as theinput of the model, and the working state of the generator is takenas the output of the model to detect the actual working conditionof the generator. A practical appli cation of a wind farm in Shandong,
China, veri ﬁed the effectiveness of CS-ERT. The results showed that
the CS-ERT method outperformed other fault detection methods( X G B o o s t ,R F ,E R T ,C S - E D T ,M e t a Cost, AdaCost and CSForest) in
MDR, AMC and gMean. The MDR of the proposed method is over
30% higher than that of ERT. The gMean of CS-ERT is more than
15% higher than that of CS-EDT, proving the advantages of theensemble algorithm. Compared with MetaCost, AdaCost andCSForest, the proposed method has better computational speedand fault detection performance. The proposed method has goodfault detection performance for wind turbine generators. We believethat CS-ERT is applicable not only to wind turbine generator faultdetection but also to other large-scale industrial fault detectionapplications. However, the proposed method has some constraintsin the detection of hybrid faults and the optimization ofhyperparameters, and is sensitive to the SCADA data quality. Infuture work, we can further study the following:
There are many hyperparameters in CS-ERT. It is dif ﬁcult to
obtain a global optimal solution by tuning thesehyperparameters. The optimization algorithm iscombined with the CS-ERT algorithm to achieve the
optimal parameters of the adaptive search model.
For multiple fault problems, we can extend the CS-ERTalgorithm from binary classi ﬁcation to multi-classi ﬁcation
in the future.
A data-driven approach applies to low noise data. Poor
quality data in SCADA systems will inevitably affect theperformance of the model. In the future, we need to furtherconsider the cleaning method for poor quality data and theimpact of noise on the model.
