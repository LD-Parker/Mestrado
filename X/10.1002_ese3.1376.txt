This paper reviews state ‐of‐the‐art numerical tools for the operation and
maintenance (O&M) of offshore wind farms, focusing on decision supportmodels for maintenance scheduling and the consideration of human and
environmental uncertainty. In this review, various factors that can influence
the successful conduct of maintenance operations will be examined and
special attention will be paid to the most significant ones. Data ‐driven
technologies for improved offshore asset management are also examined andthe most used data ‐driven methods for modeling and optimizing turbine
operation and maintenance are presented. A focus will be placed on the choice
of maintenance strategy, which is the basis for the planning of operations and
thus the optimization problem discussed. As offshore maintenance is a
complex operation whose efficiency and safety depend on human and
environmental factors, special attention will be paid to the planning strategy
that minimizes the risks involved while maximizing efficiency by consideringthese factors. The choice of planning technique for turbine maintenance and
better consideration of uncertainties are crucial areas of improvement as they
can lead to better overall efficiency, higher profit margins, better safety, and
improved sustainability of offshore wind farms. The paper covers the
application of digital technologies for offshore wind O&M planning and theassociated challenges. The paper also highlights the various environmental
and human factors to be considered for the operation and maintenance of
wind turbines.

1|INTRODUCTION
Today, major environmental problems are being brought
on by the unsustainable exploitation of natural resources
worldwide. Many authorities have presented plans forlowering greenhouse gas emissions and developing
renewable energy sources to combat the deterioration
of the environment. Objectives ask for a 27% increase inenergy efficiency, a 40% decrease in CO
2emissions, and
a binding objective of 27% for renewable energy by
2030.1The necessity of investing in renewable and clean
energy resources is evident given the growing environ-mental and ecological issues. In recent years, renewable
energy has become a key step in the development of
natural energy goals. In many countries around theglobe, energies from natural gas, coal, and fuel oil are
being replaced by renewable energy sources including
wind, solar, and geothermal energy.
2Offshore wind
energy is essential to the transformation of the world's
energy system because it is a sustainable energy source.
In comparison to equivalent and type onshore windpower, offshore wind farms (OWFs) produce 50% moreelectricity at higher speeds and with less turbulence.
3
Investment decision ‐makers around the world are
extremely interested in the offshore wind because of itsenormous potential, high average power generation, no
land occupation, high level of cleanliness, and availabil-
ity.
4The current offshore wind potential is expected to
multiply in the coming years, resulting in a monumental
implementation state.5Due to supportive policies and
increased energy production, offshore wind powerprojects have been proposed quickly. However, tocompete with fossil fuels, both offshore and onshore
wind turbines need to be as cost ‐effective and reliable as
possible. This requires optimizing wind turbine mainte-nance work to avoid unnecessary costs. Operation and
maintenance (O&M) work begins with OWF commis-
sioning and continues through the final decommission-ing phase. Costs in O&M phase are generally not as high
as in the construction phase but are still significant due
to the long operational duration during the lifecycle.Operating and maintenance costs for a typical 500 MW
OWF range from £25 to £40 m.
6
O&M activities are, therefore, paramount for lifetime
power generation from OWFs. Failure of any element ofthe park can reduce or even stop power generation,
resulting in significant economic loss. It is important to
adopt a maintenance strategy that can reduce thenumber of failures through a series of planned O&M
activities such as inspection, repair, and replacement.
7
Both long ‐term and short ‐term scenarios must be
considered to create a reliable tool for OWF operations
and maintenance planning. Long ‐term plans, generallydeveloped at the design stage, are those in which the
intervention is planned 1 year before or more. Short ‐term
planning is for operational situations when already
planned tasks need to be done the next day, or when
an unexpected failure occurs, and repair needs to be donein the shortest possible time. To limit operating and
maintenance costs, which typically represent 25% –30% of
the total lifetime cost of an OWF, the effectiveness andefficiency of operating and maintenance plans should bemaximized. With the growth of the offshore wind
industry, the researcher has developed several numerical
models that enable optimized planning of his O&Mtasks.
8The growth of OWFs depends significantly on
how well offshore wind turbines (OWTs) are operated
and maintained. Given the practical restrictions placedby offshore operations and the comparatively high
expenses, maintenance, as opposed to operations, is a
crucial component of the levelized cost of energy. AnOWF's lifecycle is particularly variable and complex as a
result of maintenance.
This study focused on how uncertainties such as
weather conditions were considered as factors affectingthe O&M plans. In fact, O&M planning relies heavily on
the evaluation of weather conditions (especially wave
height, wave period, current speed, and wind speed) andtime windows during which the O&M operator can carry
out work. Evaluation of weather windows typically
consists of a simplified analysis of sea area data ofinterest using thresholds chosen for a particular task. A
weather window is a period of time during which
weather conditions do not exceed a set threshold for asufficient period of time to accomplish this task. Thechoice of thresholds in weather window evaluation is
primarily determined by the health, safety, and environ-
mental requirements and considerations of the O&Moperator as well as the economic factors of the wind farm
operator. Met ocean conditions considered suitable for a
particular task must be such that the O&M operator cansafely perform that task. However, these thresholds
should ensure that sufficient man ‐hours are available to
carry out all planned O&M activities, thereby mitigatingthe risk of power generation downtime. Redesigning
long ‐term planning and operations of charter vessels to
withstand more severe conditions is also an importantpart of the optimization. Improving the reliability andsuitability of weather window analysis will lead to more
efficient and effective O&M planning. This means
reducing the O&M costs for the offshore wind industryand making working conditions for O&M operators safer.
This is especially true in short ‐term operational situa-
tions where the decision ‐making process about perform-
ing tasks becomes more important. In reality, there is a
risk that the task will be scheduled for a particular day,1502 | HADJOUDJ ANDPANDIT

but when the crew and technicians meet in port in the
morning, they discover that bad weather makes sailingimpractical or they may set sail and arrive at the OWF
only to find that the weather conditions make it
impossible to carry out the mission safely, or they mayget seasick on the way to the OWF. In all of these
situations, the scheduled task may not run and run on
another day that was incorrectly determined to beinappropriate for its scope. This will eventually lead tomore outages and longer periods when turbines are not
generating power.
Uncertainty is also in the selection of threshold
parameters and values that determine the feasibility of a
set of weather conditions. In fact, thresholds such as
maximum allowable significant wave height and peakwave period are indirect parameters rather than direct
measures of the actual feasibility of the task. This
overview presents tools that OWF are currently usingto solve their O&M operations plan. For this purpose,
numerical tools to assess the existence of weather
windows for O&M tasks and maintenance planning areconsidered. The main feature of this paper is theinvestigation of decision ‐making tools in wind turbine
maintenance planning, including uncertainties such as
weather ‐related vessel movement, to determine
operability.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section 2, we explain the overview of the wind turbine
(onshore/offshore) asset management (AM) and decision
support system. What parameters cause uncertainty to
the offshore O&M will be covered in Section 3. Section 4
discusses the data used to construct techniques foroptimizing the turbine's O&M activities, improving
uncertainty, and minimizing maintenance costs. Differ-
ent digital technologies used for wind turbine O&M areinvestigated in Section 5; this includes methods currently
used in decision support models for OWF maintenance
scheduling covering regression and classification models.Section 6explores the challenges associated with
Offshore decision management and concludes the paper
in Section 7.
2|OVERVIEW OF AM AND
DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM
In the financial sector, the term AM refers to the
management of various financial tangible andintangible assets. However, the term is being used more
and more frequently in the infrastructure industry as
well, where it has been realized that having a well ‐
thought ‐out management strategy in place is essential,
particularly when it comes to the management ofnumerous, significant, and frequently diverse infra-
structure assets.
Asset managers are under increasing pressure to
accurately understand the condition of the power assets
in their network so they can choose the most cost ‐
effective plan of action for operation, maintenance, and
replacement. But how can you tell which assets require
care while ensuring that risks are kept to a minimum andwhen is the best time? Are you convinced that the ratingfor your asset is based on the most recent data? Making
choices on these matters is very challenging because the
system has such a large number of valued goods.
The Institute of Asset Management, in part in
collaboration with the British Standards Institute, issued
a number of publications on AM in response to thegrowing demand for a standardized framework. The AM
frameworks were released in 2006. The Publicly Accessi-
ble Standard for Asset Management, or PAS 55, wasreleased in 2008. ISO 55000, 55001, and 55002 were
developed by the International Organization for Stan-
dardization based on PAS 55:2008 and released in 2014.The “Asset Management —An Anatomy, ”evaluation of
the ISO 55000 series was released by the IAM in 2015. It
considers all previously published texts and provides an
explanation of AM, including why and practical applica-tions. Assets are complex, interdependent, dynamic in
behavior, subject to rapid change, varying in a lifetime,
have to be monitored, analyzed, and diagnosed tounderstand them and require technical knowledge,
according to “Asset Management —An Anatomy, ”which
challenges this claim. Assets also have to be monitored,analyzed, and diagnosed to understand them and requiretechnical knowledge Based on the following six princi-
ples, the ISO 55000 approaches this challenge:
•The organization's core value, which needs to be
identified
•There must be a direct link between the company plan
and the AM services provided by the team.
•To ensure that AM is nicely carried out, the organiza-
tion's objectives are met and AM thinking, andpractices overcome traditional boundaries, leadership
must bear direct responsibility for its execution. As a
result, it must be exhibited by all organizationalauthorities.
•Monitoring and auditing to ensure that assets and
linked processes are used as intended to carry out AM
activities and accomplish AM objectives that will lastover time.
•An understanding of all stages and levels of the
lifecycle.
•For AM decision ‐making to be successful, it must be
competent, reliable, and ideal. It also necessitatesHADJOUDJ ANDPANDIT |1503

finding the optimum compromise between AM's
competing themes.
AM is referred to be an interdisciplinary field of
study that incorporates knowledge from all areas of theasset's lifecycle and management and requires buy ‐in
from all players. To get a better understanding of the
intricacy, the AM manager may need to take astep back.
The wind turbines and the internal grid of the farm,
which includes cables and transformers, are the major
assets in wind farm management. An asset system couldbe used to characterize the wind farm itself. Wind
turbines are made up of a variety of pieces, all of which
require separate management, operation, and mainte-nance techniques because of their vastly varying compo-
sitions, structures, and functions. The various compo-
nents are referred to as asset components in this study.The various wind turbine asset components are as
follows:•Foundation
•Tower
•Gearbox
•Blades
•Transformer
It is obvious that the parts of a wind turbine might be
further separated into groups, with the transformer andgearbox, in particular, having a large number of parts.But this would be outside the paper's purview.
The recent tools created
9for the planning and
coordination of renewable energy systems are examplesof computational decision tools that can support
complicated decision ‐making in the energy sector and
follows a similar kind of framework as shown inFigure 1. Performance analysis of a renewable energy
system serves as the foundation for this type of decision ‐
supporting tool. Only a small portion of the currentdecision support systems in the wind energy industry are
appropriate for offshore projects,

these are focused on onshore initiatives. As opposed to a
vast area like the North Sea, the technologies are morelikely to be usable offshore in a constrained geo-
graphic area.
To achieve a considerable reduction in the cost of
energy throughout the course of OWFs, cost ‐effective
O&M techniques must be developed, as O&M expenses
make up about one ‐third of the lifecycle cost of an OWF.
In recent years, a number of researchers have developeddecision support tools for various uses in offshore wind
production, including forecasting a wind farm's opera-
tions,
11estimating O&M costs including revenue loss,12
and simulating the operational phase of an OWF with all
maintenance activities and costs.13Finding the best
maintenance strategy or planning for a specific OWF, asopposed to a general strategy for several farms, is a
common goal of these tools. Levelised production cost
(LPC), which is viewed as an effective method for theanalysis and evaluation of risk and total cost across the
life of offshore turbines, may be used by the decision
tools to determine maintenance costs. In Myhr et al.,
14ex-
amined the effectiveness of the operational and mainte-nance simulation models currently in use for OWFs; they
also identified the fundamental model premises that
influence model outcomes.
The operational phase of an OWF, including all
maintenance operations and costs, can be simulated by
the offshore wind cost and benefit model NOW ‐Icob.
13
Changes can be made to a number of input parameters in
the model to examine their effects on performance
parameters like O&M costs and availability. These inputparameters include both controllable options anduncontrollable external factors. All strategic alternatives
that the owner of the wind farm can directly choose are
considered controllable options. All elements that are notdirectly under the control of the operator of the wind
farm, such as the market environment and weather
patterns, are referred to as uncontrollable externalfactors. Although these two factors are frequently
assumed to be deterministic, the majority of the tools
focus on modeling failures and repair. To mimic thevariability of the failure rates of wind turbine compo-
nents, stochastic modeling is recommended, however, as
a deterministic approach would not produce realisticfindings. One effective computational method used toaddress stochastic data challenges is discrete ‐event
simulation.
15
Operational research (OR) has a long history of
helping businesses run more efficiently, especially when
it comes to cutting expenses.16A variety of OR
techniques have been used in the planning of productionschedules, transportation routes, and maintenance sup-
ply chains in the field of renewable energy. Anoptimization approach for scheduling energy production
in a wind farm, for instance,
17was provided. Connolly
et al.18have examined related research on the scheduling
and capacity planning of renewable energy. Offshore
wind O&M has also been optimized using OR ap-proaches. To assist in making decisions on challenges
involving the makeup of a vessel fleet, a mixed integer
programming model with binary variables is typicallyused.
19To design the vessel fleet with crews for the
execution of maintenance operations in OWFs, vessel
properties, and contracts should be taken into considera-
tion. The most typical objective function is to minimizethe fixed costs of the ships and ports, the variable costs
associated with using the ships, the expected costs
associated with expected downtime associated withdelayed correct maintenance activities, as well as penalty
and/or transportation costs. The number of vessels
available, the amount of time needed to complete amaintenance task, the locations of the resources available
for maintenance, and the sea state appropriate for O&M
activities are typical constraints on the best solutions.The reliability of the wind turbines is an important factorto consider when modeling O&M procedures for OWFs
because it has an impact on the project's output,
including energy output and cost per unit of producedenergy. The decision ‐making process for corrective
maintenance operations is complicated by the dearth of
publicly available data on OWT failure. Several modelshave been created to forecast costs
20or to calculate O&M
expenses21by taking wind turbine reliability into
account. The failure rates of OWTs can be calculatedusing reliability models, which can also be used todetermine how long it takes to fix each form of failure.
Energy losses resulting from wind turbine malfunctions,
downtime, and maintenance procedures are consideredto be a component of maintenance costs. However, a
substantial amount of failure rates utilized in earlier
studies were taken from data from onshore wind farms,and the impact of the marine environment on the
reliability of OWTs has not been taken into account. An
examination of the decision support and optimizationmodels for maintenance in OWFs revealed that there has
not been much work done on integrating optimization
models into decision support systems.
3|DECISION ‐MAKING UNDER
METEOROLOGICALUNCERTAINTY
It is important to consider environmental uncertainties
about factors like wave height and wind speed because
they could affect installation and maintenance activities,HADJOUDJ ANDPANDIT |1505
 20500505, 2023, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ese3.1376 by Test, Wiley Online Library on [05/05/2023].

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
thereby causing delays and financial costs. Appropriate
models should be created to replicate an installationscenario for a large number of historical environmental
data to integrate these uncertainties in the estimation.
The offshore cons studies include a wide range of
topics, including both immediate (such as real ‐time,
hourly, daily, and weekly operating decisions) and long ‐
term perspectives (e.g., planning or policy making). Thedecision ‐making process is fed by input parameters, most
of which are unpredictable. The art of handling
uncertainty has undergone many developments and has
most recently come into focus.
Making decisions can benefit greatly from quantifying
uncertainty. It is feasible to assess various scenarios and,
with a certain degree of confidence, select the bestsuitable one by accurately estimating the uncertainty.
This can be especially helpful when making decisions
about issues with significant implications. These canrange from management choices involving huge offshore
wind energy infrastructure assets to global policies. These
issues are typically complex and have a wide variety ofrisk factors. Additionally, they frequently depend on oneanother. Therefore, analysts and decision ‐makers should
accurately depict associated uncertainties, their reliance,
as well as the combined effect of all these aspects, toensure that the problem under investigation is sufficiently
informed.
Offshore construction operations are exposed to a
number of unknowns, including environmental factors,
equipment and/or vessel failure, varying operation
durations, availability of necessary components, and soon. However, underestimating environmental factors,including wind speed and substantial wave height, which
are challenging to estimate during the planning stage, is
one of the major causes of project length underestima-tions and delays. Due to these factors, project schedulers
may employ buffers during the planning stage, which
may result in an overestimation of the project's time and,consequently, its installation cost. Finding a system that
would help schedulers include these uncertainties will
enable them to estimate the length of offshore installa-tion activities with greater accuracy and reliability.
The forecasting of environmental time series has been
the subject of extensive research in the past. Thefollowing techniques are mentioned by Zounemat ‐
Kermani and Kisi
22to model the characteristics of wind
and waves: statistical techniques, discrete spectral
approach, stochastic simulation, numerical methods,and data ‐driven models (such as artificial neural net-
works, fuzzy wavelet model, genetic programming and
fuzzy logic). Furthermore, Monbet et al.
23surveys of
stochastic models for wind and wave state time
series divide these models into nonparametric models,models based on Gaussian approximations, and other
parametric models. A chaotic theory ‐based study of
wind ‐wave time series is also suggested by Zounemat ‐
Kermani and Kisi.22
However, these approaches do not necessarily
illuminate the underlying physical characteristics of a
joint probability distribution. In light of the fact that
environmental random variables are defined by a non ‐
normal joint distribution, li ttle or nothing has been said
about their joint probabilities. To predict the design
parameters of wind speed and wave characteristics
without taking their depe ndence into account, uni-
variate distributions are usually utilized. The joint
distribution of wave features such as significant wave
height and wave period should also be studied. Toidentify the relationship b etween significant wave
height and wave time, Salvadori et al.
24employed
Copulas, Athanassoulis et al.25applied applications of
the Placket model, and Galiatsatou and Prinos26looked
into various bivariate dist ributions. Very few studies
look at how wind speed and significant wave height aredistributed together. In particular, Fouques et al.
27
provide two methods based on multivariate Hermite
polynomials expansion of the multinormal distribution
and one way utilizing simply the correlation matrix todescribe the co ‐occurrence of those variables including
the wave duration. Additionally, Bitner ‐Gregensen and
Haver
28,29created a joint environmental model that
takes into account wind, waves, currents, and sea level
and are based on the conditional modeling approach
(CMA). The joint distribution based on parametric fitsfor each one ‐dimensional marginal was calculated using
this model for the design and operation of marine
constructions.
30Additionally, the Nataf model31is
frequently applied in the literature to model cosmologi-cal variables. The Nataf model, however, may result in
biased results when the transformation to standard
normal variates deviates from a multinormal distribu-tion, as stated in Bitner ‐Gregersen et al.
32Finally, using
Copulas to estimate the joint distribution of wind speed
and significant wave height without accounting for theautocorrelation —which is crucial when time series are
required —Yang and Zhang
33adopted a similar strategy
to the one outlined in this article.
The perfect tool for the management of an OWF
would be one that is able to determine the right
maintenance strategy depending on the condition of
the wind farm, the type of turbine, and the potentialfailures of the turbines but also to adapt its planning to
the changing weather conditions at sea. The right
strategy involves making a clear inventory of the windfarm and putting the right sensors in the right places in
the turbine to be able to collect as much data as possible1506 | HADJOUDJ ANDPANDIT

about the health of the turbine. Regarding the weather,
several options are possible. First, it is possible toimplement a deep learning tool as presented in this part
by taking it with data from the meteorological institutes
of a region close or similar to that of the wind farm andthen using this tool in the planning operations and
planning all possible scenarios given the weather
conditions at a time t. Otherwise, set up a weather
station (wind + sea) with the prediction tools that gowith it and sensors throughout the wind farm, would be
much more expensive.
4|DATA USED IN THE O&M OF
WIND TURBINES
To develop reliable weather window assessments, it is
crucial and vital to have access to reliable met oceandata. Sometimes the data need to be created since they
are not readily available. To obtain numerous realistic
time series of wind speed, wave period, and significantwave height, an alternate method to sensors is studied inthis chapter. These time series might be useful for more
effective planning and scheduling of offshore installation
activities. To identify the best vessel and equipmentcombination that is needed for a certain operation and to
arrange the sequence of complicated offshore installation
procedures. As a result, a significant number of environ-mental time series are required to account for environ-
mental condition uncertainties that restrict operations.
The collection of environmental time series is difficult,costly, and sometimes impossible to obtain. Moreover,even when it is possible to collect these data, there are
often missing values due to failures in the measurement
tools,
34which might affect the prediction of the duration
of offshore operations. Considering the relationship
between the environmental parameters is crucial for
creating genuine environmental time series. Data gener-ation makes sense at that point.
The majority of the new digital solutions for offshore
wind decision management are based on machinelearning (ML) and data analysis, which both demand
a vast quantity of data. Data collection and management
are challenges that data scientists must overcome. Infact, a lot of data is necessary for ML models to betrained effectively. Large data sets are frequently
challenging for businesses to obtain in a timely manner
t ot r a i na ne f f e c t i v em o d e l .I ti se x p e n s i v ea n dt i m e ‐
consuming to manually classify data. But data scientists
and businesses may get over these barriers and create
trustworthy ML models more quickly by producing andusing synthetic data. These techniques need a lot of data
to be trained effectively, however, due to privacyconcerns, this data may be difficult to get or use. To
do this, numerous technologies have been created overthe past few decades to generate a significant amount of
data from a sample.
To generate those data, various tools are used. These
tools include ML techniques like GAN,
35generative
adversarial networks, and VAE,36variational autoenco-
der, as well as approaches like SMOTE,37synthetic
minority oversampling techniques, and the study of thenearest neighbors. ML methods will be the ones to
examine due to the nature of our data, the issue
encountered by the OWF, and the complexity of thedistribution of our data (weather forecasting), as they are
both more efficient and more accurate than other
methods. In 85% of the scenarios studied in Xu's study,some variation of GAN outperformed conventional
synthetic data ‐generating methods.
38
The GAN, one of the most current powerful ML
methods, has a lot of potential for tabular data synthesis.
A type of neural network architecture for generative
modeling is known as GANs. Goodfellow et al.35initially
introduced GANs in 2014. Due to their superiorperformance, conditional generative adversarial network
(CGAN) and CopulaGAN models are chosen over GAN
for creating tabular data.
38Traditionally, a vector
sampled from a common multivariate normal distribu-
tion is given to the generator in a GAN (MVN). One
finally achieves a deterministic transformation thattranslates the standard MVN into the distribution of
the data by training alongside a discriminator neural
network. The imbalance in the categorical columns is nottaken into account by this technique for training agenerator. The generator might not be properly trained if
the training data are randomly picked since the rows that
belong to the minor category will not be adequatelyrepresented. The generator in CGAN learns the re-
sampled distribution, which is distinct from the distribu-
tion of the training data. The objective is to efficientlyresample such that, during the training phase, all
categories from discrete characteristics are sampled
equally (but not necessarily uniformly), and to retrievethe (nonresampled) real data distribution during the
test.
39A CGAN model variant called CopulaGAN38
makes use of Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) ‐
based modification to speed up CGAN model training.
Generally speaking, all models are capable of
accurately capturing the relationships between features.
All of the models exhibit comparable performance,demonstrating that artificial data may be used to solve
ML issues in place of actual data. Both meteorological
and data on wind turbine failure can be generated usingthese data producers. They assist in training the various
decision ‐making models for managing vessels andHADJOUDJ ANDPANDIT |1507

predicting failures, both of which are helpful for
planning maintenance.
5|DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES
FOR OFFSHORE WIND DECISION
MANAGEMENT
The everyday operations of OWTs require an efficient
and dependable maintenance approach. It is hard to
achieve 24 ‐h operations with no onsite maintenance
delays since personnel must go to the wind farm from aport. A maintenance crew ought to go to the wind farm
periodically to prevent failures. Unnecessarily frequent
visits, on the other hand, are ineffective and costly due tothe substantial need for maintenance staff and vessels. A
decreased visit frequency, on the other hand, can lead to
a higher failure rate and, as a result, longer downtime. Asa result, the frequency of maintenance involves a trade ‐
off between hazards, vessel capacity, personnelresources, and other factors.
An effective maintenance strategy strives to maximize
financial gain, increase component lifespans, lessen theneed for emergency repairs, cut down on overtime labor
expenditures, and lessen the stress that unanticipated
equipment breakdowns cause on the job. According tothe timing of maintenance, maintenance strategies areoften divided into corrective (reactive), proactive, and
opportunistic categories.
40In Figure 2, these classes are
displayed. The following are the meanings of the colorshifts between the various lines:
•When the wind turbine changes from green to red, it
stops working.
•When the wind turbine changes from red to green, it

•Tasks are carried out by a maintenance vessel, ranging
in color from blue to orange.
•An upkeep vessel is back at the port and waiting for
new assignments as it changes from orange to blue.
A failure ‐based maintenance technique known as
corrective maintenance, sometimes known as reactive
maintenance, only performs maintenance after a failurehas already happened. High availability can be effectivelyattained with the corrective maintenance technique
while eliminating unnecessary maintenance visits and
inspections. As a result, it is appropriate for a systemwith little downtime loss. However, because of a high
failure rate and comparatively low system reliability, the
corrective maintenance technique proves to beunattractive and unworkable for large OWFs.
42
Unexpected failures could result in higher costs thananticipated downtime. Additionally, the marine environ-ment makes equipment less accessible and less reliable;
for instance, a failure might only be discovered by the
maintenance team after a protracted period of downtime.
Figure 2illustrates the maintenance strategies where
the usually operating OWT, the stopped OWT due to
failures, and the halted wind turbine owing to mainte-
nance are each represented by the colors green, red, andyellow. The waiting maintenance vessel is represented by
the color blue, while the task ‐performing vessel is
represented by the color orange. Proposed in the early1970s, proactive maintenance is a more sophisticated
strategy
41that involves routine examination and replace-
ment before failure to stop minor faults from becomingsignificant failures. Only 25% of failures are major, whilemajor failures account for 95% of downtime.
43A practice
that is still in its infancy, proactive maintenance
primarily consists of preventive and condition ‐based
maintenance strategies.
Typically, a preventive strategy refers to planned
maintenance that happens at (i) a predetermined time or(ii) a specific level of power generation. Optimizing the
production plan and the economical maintenance plan is
the aim of the preventive maintenance strategy. Thebenefits of this strategy over corrective maintenance
include: (1) eliminating unplanned maintenance; (2)
having a good maintenance weather window; (3)minimizing the impact of unpredictable weather; (4)making reasonable use of service vessels; (5) avoiding
having an excessive number of spare parts; (6) combining
maintenance and repairs; (7) optimizing maintenancetasks; and (8) making a contribution to a successful asset
maintenance plan.
Optimized maintenance scheduling has been imple-
mented using data ‐driven methodologies, such as ML,
which has gained popularity in recent years.
44The mostpopular method is supervised learning. The tagged data
is used to train a black ‐box neural network model, which
may then be used for a variety of analysis, monitoring,
and prediction tasks.44This strategy is particularly well
suited for scenarios that are challenging to modelbecause of their great complexity and ambiguity.
However, there are several drawbacks to learning
strategies. The procedure first heavily depends on thecaliber and volume of measured data. The neuralnetwork deteriorates when the required measurements
are missing. It is very challenging to demonstrate
stability. The network architecture affects the robustnessand speed of computation. Failure can rarely be detected
if the failure scenarios are not included in the trained
data. Therefore, the ability to represent the entire datasample and educate our decision tool to consider all
options makes data generation helpful.
5.1 |ML models
This section examines the current applications of ML in
reliability engineering and safety. When doing such an
endeavor, it is impossible to claim to be thorough, but we
have made an effort to sample important articles fromeach of the ML categories and subcategories mentioned
above. A ML algorithm's fundamental components are as
follows: Datasets for testing and training, an objectivefunction or loss function to optimize, such as a sum of
squared errors or a likelihood function, plus an
optimization technique and a model for the data are allrequired (e.g., linear, nonlinear, nonparametric). It issimple to imagine the extremely broad range of ML
applications for reliability and safety applications by
changing any one of these components, such as bylooking at various datasets in various industries, applying
various ML models to various systems or components, or
changing some models and algorithms to better suit thetask at hand. In general, the goal is to bring new, more
precise findings from datasets for improved dependabil-
ity, safety ‐informed decision ‐making, and more success-
ful accident prevention. For the estimation of an asset's
remaining usable life (RUL), anomaly and fault detec-
tion, health monitoring, maintenance planning, anddeterioration evaluation, ML models are utilized.
5.1.1 |Regression models
For estimating RUL and forecasting degradation, super-
vised regression is frequently utilized. Applications ofML to various technical products are discussed in the
literature in this field, including Li ‐ion batteries,

railroad tracks,46turbine ‐cutting tools,47rolling bear-
ings,48and aviation engines.49For a safety ‐critical
system, an accurate prediction of an equipment RUL
and degradation level is crucial, and condition ‐based
maintenance is crucial to reduce system downtime andother negative effects of a run ‐to‐failure strategy. The
desire for better prognostics and health management
(PHM) necessitates, among other things, a more precisecalculation of the RUL. RUL prediction is a keycomponent of PHM. Two major categories can be used
to categorize approaches to RUL and deterioration level
predictions, with a third hybrid category straddling thefirst two: (i) model ‐based techniques, which develop
failure models based on a thorough examination of the
physical characteristics of the failure mechanism inquestion.
50These models need in ‐depth prior knowledge
and subject ‐matter experience; (ii) data ‐driven techniques,which construct degradation models from old sensor data
and hence do not need system ‐specific prior knowledge
see Table 1, for example. Given the quality and quantity
of the available data, these models can be created using
a variety of ML techniques, and their accuracy andcomputing requirements can vary. The identification
and diagnosis of faults frequently utilize supervised
categorization.
5.1.2 |Classification models
This entails both online monitoring of equipment
deterioration stages and diagnosing various failure
kinds (binary and multiclass). In this context, classifi-cation sits at the crossroads of two more general issues,
predictive maintenance, and PHM, and it offers vital

6|CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED
WITH OFFSHORE DECISIONMANAGEMENT
The difficulties involved with maintenance jobs, which
are among the most important responsibilities for OWTs,
stem from a variety of factors. In the first place, the
separation between an OWF and a port or beach restrictsaccessibility and lengthens downtime. The ownership oremployment of a maintenance fleet and an increased
number of technicians is costly. The incorporation of
bottom ‐fixed and floating foundations has also increased
the complexity of OWTs. Additionally, the accessibility of
OWTs for service vessels and personnel transfers from
the vessel to the OWT is constrained by weatherconditions, particularly substantial wave heights and
wind speeds. Although such equipment is still bulky and
expensive, motion ‐compensated gangways for offshore
access systems have been regularly used in conjunction
with service operation vessels during the past 10 years.
58
There will likely be a lengthier wait time and a bigger
loss of power generation during downtime if mainte-nance work needs to be delayed because of weather
conditions. Due to the specialized equipment needed,
even without taking the effects of weather into account,OWT maintenance costs are higher than those of
identical jobs performed on land. Furthermore, OWT
component failure rates are increased by a harsh offshoreworking environment, increased wind speed, wave ‐
induced motions, and structural vibrations. Additionally,
larger and more specialized devices are needed foroffshore maintenance and repairs because of the recentgrowth in OWT size, which aims to increase power ‐
generating efficiency.
Given that it is anticipated that wind energy will
supply 50% of the world's electricity consumption by
2050, extensive maintenance and repair work will be
necessary for the coming decades.
59,60Therefore, it is
equally crucial to investigate how OWT maintenance
affects the ecosystem. Hence, the overall purpose of a
proper repair and maintenance strategy must balancemaximizing profitability and minimizing environmental
consequences, so contributing to the sustainable devel-
opment of offshore wind energy over the long run.According to the discussion above, it is evident that OWTmaintenance is difficult, and good maintenance will
guarantee a decrease in downtime while minimizing
energy production losses. The broad subject of OWTO&M can be split into a number of unconnected research
problems, including overall cost management and
logistical planning, on ‐site operations and mechanical
designs for particular operations, and forward ‐looking
evaluation of prospective consequences. Even thoughresearchers and engineers from related fields have
researched each subproblem, an amalgamation of thesetechnologies is still in its early stages. To make
computations and analyses more closely approximate
reality, research in OWT maintenance entails a higherlevel of complexity and ambiguity. Every area of OWT
maintenance has recently improved due to significant
theoretical and technological improvements. A correctivemaintenance method is no longer appropriate as OWFsgrow in size quickly, and proactive maintenance strate-
gies are gradually taking their place.
Maintenance jobs must be scheduled based on
straightforward route planning and more complex
scenarios to be carried out efficiently. By taking into
account the capacity of the mode of transportation, aswell as the availability of workers and parts, route
planning for OWT maintenance, has been accomplished
using one or more O&M bases. The goal of choosing thebest route is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while
maintaining the highest level of efficiency. Additional
factors that should be taken into account by idealscheduling include reducing downtime, increasing reve-nue, enhancing system reliability, and fostering coopera-
tion amongst maintenance teams.
After scheduling, the next phase is on ‐site mainte-
nance, which is very different from on ‐shore turbine
maintenance. First, erratic weather restricts the move-
ment of employees and equipment and places stricterdemands on the modes of transportation. Additionally, a
second docking action is necessary. In this study, docking
devices including active motion ‐compensated access
devices and basic fenders have been studied. Whileweighing the significance of many crucial collision ‐
related elements, the possibility of collision between
service vessels and the turbine should be considered. Dueto the unpredictable wave heights, the criteria for lifting
operations are stiffer for OWTs. Specialized and expen-
sive lifting equipment are often required, whose dailyrates are higher than for onshore equivalent. To decrease
the height that external cranes must lift heavy compo-
nents from, it has been suggested that built ‐in lifting
equipment be installed on OWT towers. Rombouts

proposed a decision ‐support tool to optimize the second
half of the “Saint ‐Brieuc project ”during the operational
phase of the OWF located near the French coast. Theirproposed tool is able to incorporate the actual status of
the project and the most recent weather forecast,
including its uncertainty and results suggesting thattools achieve high accuracy. In recent years, a variety of
O&M simulation tools has been developed, including

are commercial products that require annual license fees,technical support, and user inputs.
7|CONCLUSION
An offshore wind project's maintenance covers a lot of
ground. Compared to onshore wind power, the cost ofmaintenance represents a greater portion of the overall
cost of energy production. Long distances from the coast,
the unpredictability of the weather (including wind andwave conditions), a lack of information from remote
monitoring, unexpected malfunctions, aging, and subjec-
tive considerations are the main obstacles to OWTmaintenance. Every area of OWT maintenance has
recently been improved by a significant quantity of
theoretical and technological breakthroughs.
It is possible to optimize OWT maintenance in two
ways. Increased weather forecasting skills, which are
essential for scheduling onsite maintenance, are one wayto improve onsite maintenance. The alternative strategyis to use robots deployed inside the tower to do simple
maintenance chores remotely or to take use of system
redundancies to keep the wind turbine operating, even ata reduced capacity, and so decrease maintenance
frequency. The ability to acquire data must be improved
for both perspectives.
Recent advancements in computational power have
created prospects for integrated and in ‐depth CM analy-
tics, where many data types can be leveraged to supportrobust decision ‐making that is based on actionable
knowledge of emerging dangers. Utilizing ML approaches
to improve monitoring procedures can help plan ahead
and reduce the need for maintenance visits to OWFs.
