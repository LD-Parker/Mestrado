Abstract 
A Bayesian approach is often applied when updating a deterioration model using observations from 
inspections, structural health monitoring, or condition monitoring. The observations  are stochastic variables 
with probability distributions that depend on the damage  size. Consecutive observations are usually 
assumed to be independent of each other, but this assu mption does not always hold, especially when using 
online monitoring systems. Frequent updating using depe ndent measurements can lead to an over-optimistic 
assessment of the value of information when t he measurements are incorrectly modeled as being 
independent. This paper presents a Bayesian network modeling approach for the inclusion of temporal 
dependency between measurements through a dependen cy parameter and presents a generic monitoring 
model based on the exceedance of thresholds for a da mage index. Additionally, the model is implemented in 
a computational framework for risk-based maintenanc e planning, developed for maintenance planning for 
wind turbines. The framework is applied for a numeric al experiment, where the expected lifetime costs are 
found for strategies with monitoring with and with out dependency between observations, and also for the 
case where dependency is present but is neglected when making decisions. The numerical experiment and 
associated parameter study show that neglecting depend ency in the decision model when the observations 
are in fact dependent, can lead to much higher costs than expected and to the selection of non-optimal 
strategies. Much lower costs (down to one quarter ) can be obtained when the dependency is properly 
modeled. In the case of temporally dependent obser vations, an advanced decision model using a Bayesian 
network as a simple digital twin is needed to make moni toring feasible compared to only using inspections.

Introduction 
Condition monitoring or structural health monitoring is  increasingly being applied in many industries such as 
the offshore wind industry1 and for bridges2,3. A shift from a simple time-based inspection and maintenance 
regime to predictive maintenance based on an updated be lief of the component health can lower the expected 
maintenance costs, especially if a risk-based approach is used to balance the ex pected costs of failures, 
preventive repairs, inspections, and monitoring.4 The theoretical background fo r this was established in the 
Bayesian pre-posterior decision theory5 and was adapted to civil engineering by Benjamin and Cornell6. For 
risk-based inspection planning (RBI) for offshore st ructures, efficient generic methods have been 
developed.7,8 Here, the outcomes of inspections are stochastic  variables with probability distributions that 
depend on the crack size. The outcomes of consecu tive inspections are assumed independent, and for 
inspections, this assumption seems fair as the time between inspections is typically several years.9 However, 
when frequent inspections or online monitoring ar e applied, the assumption of independence should be 
challenged, as joint uncertainties could cause depende ncy between inspection or monitoring outcomes.  
Monitoring is defined as follows in COST 345: “Monit oring can be defined as any periodic or continuous 
operation where the behavior of a structure, or of its components – such as foundations, is quantified in some 
way so that its serviceability and stability can be evaluated.”10 The term condition monitoring (CM) is often 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
used for mechanical components and structural hea lth monitoring (SHM) is often used for structural 
components. Rytter11 defined four levels for vibration-based in spection, which are widely used for CM and 
SHM: Detection, localization, assessment (quantifica tion of size), and consequence (for safety). The second 
and third levels are related to diagnosis, and the l ast level is considered to also include the future 
performance of the structure and is therefore often calle d prognosis and is related to remaining useful life 
(RUL) estimation.12 To include monitoring in a framework for predictive maintenance decisions, one must 
have information about the diagnosis and prognosis.  
There are many published studies on the use of mon itoring for detection, localization, diagnosis, and 
prognosis. Monitoring can also be applied to assess th e consequence of extreme events such as earthquake13 
or vehicle impact on a bridge14, or it can be used to decrease uncertainties on loading15 or to estimate the 
health of the structure or component. For modern  wind turbines, CM systems based on vibration 
measurements are widely used for mechanical compone nts in the drivetrain such as bearings and gears. 
Commonly used methods for diagnosis are developed based on envelope analysis utilizing the high-
frequency resonance technique16. Methods for prognosis are being developed, for example, a data-driven 
failure prognostics mixture of Gaussian hidden Markov models for bearings17, a mixture of Gaussian 
Bayesian belief networks18, and neural network approaches19. Even for wind turbines without dedicated CM 
systems, supervisory control and data  acquisition (SCADA) systems are always installed, and the data can be 
used for CM, although large uncertain ties and false alarms are present20. For wind turbine main bearings, a 
non-linear model based on temperature measuremen ts was developed by Bach-Andersen et al.21, and Mazidi 
et al.22 developed an approach for stress monitoring us ing neural networks and the proportional hazard 
model. For wind turbine blades, th ere is a large potential for SHM.23 Methods based on actuated vibrations24, 
frequency response transmissibility analysis25,26, and acoustic emission27 have been proposed. Also for the 
wind turbine structure, vibration-based methods have been proposed.28  
Monitoring can only affect the reliability and mainte nance costs when observations are used to support 
decisions on actions. ISO239429 states that when results from inspecti ons, monitoring, etc. are available, 
Bayesian statistical methods should be applied to upda te the reliability, and the updated reliability should be 
the basis for decision making with respect to maintena nce and repair. Some studies apply Bayesian methods 
for prognosis based on vibration measurements30–32, but make the prognosis for the vibration measurements 
instead of for the underlying deterioration process. To  account for the uncertainty related to the monitoring 
signal, the damage size and the outcome of the monitoring system can be considered as two separate 
variables, where a probabilistic model relates the variab les. Then, it is possible to evaluate the reliability 
based on the probabilistic models, and decisions can be made on this basis. The link between monitoring and 
costs has been the focus of the COST Action TU14 02. In this relation, the importance of unbiased 
measurements was emphasized in Faber et al.33, where the principles for a theoretical framework for 
estimation of the value of information (VoI) from SH M was presented following the principles set by the 
Joint Committee on Structural Safety (JCSS)34 and in ISO 239429. In order for the measurements to be 
unbiased, the model needs to account properly for any dependency between measurements. This is in line 
with the ISO2394 that states that any temporal or spatial correlation should be accounted for.  
Many published papers can be found on the assessment of the value of monitoring. However, the focus is 
often either load monitoring or inspections. If onlin e monitoring is considered, the outcomes are often 
modeled as independent, and the tempor al dependencies are neglected. Thöns35 and Thöns et al.15 used load 
monitoring of hot spots for a jacket structure and updated the inspection plan according to the loading 
information obtained. The optimal inspection plans without and with monitoring are obtained using the 
generic approach for RBI presented by Straub7 and Straub and Faber36. Qin et al.37 assumed that it was 
possible to monitor the annual dama ge increment, and the independent monitoring outcomes were used to 
update the mean value of the distribution for the annual damage increment. Straub38 described how to 
estimate VoI of fatigue monitoring based on structural reliability methods and did al so consider monitoring 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
outcomes to be independent. In many studies, onl ine monitoring observations were assumed to be 
independent given the damage size4,39–44. Pozzi and Der Kiureghian45 considered the assessment of VoI from 
monitoring and propose modeling the additive error term s as jointly normally distributed random variables, 
possibly correlated with a given covariance matrix. Howe ver, the estimation of the covariance matrix or the 
implications for the results are not considered, and th e example in the paper does not include the correlation. 
Straub and Faber46 considered the correlation between inspection outcomes of different but similar hot spots 
and studied how this correlation influenced the update d failure probability of the system. They concluded 
that normally the influence of inspection dependency would be limited compared to other contributors of 
uncertainty.  They identified the following contribut ions to the uncertainty of inspection outcomes: 
 Random noise (aleatoric) 
 Statistical uncertainty due to limited data availabl e for estimation of the probability of detection 
(PoD) model 
 Model uncertainty due to the use of a parametric model 
 Model uncertainty due to factors not included in the inspection model, e.g. human factors, 
environment, defect orienta tion, geometry, and location. 
The statistical uncertainties and some model uncertainties will be time-invariant, i.e. the stochastic variables 
modeling the uncertainties will have fixed (but unknown ) values for a given defect. This would be the case 
for model uncertainties that depend on the inspector or the location/orientation of the defect. However, not 
all model uncertainties are time-invariant; they could also change with time if the influencing factor changes, 
e.g. if the inspector is different for each inspection or the environmental conditions change over the year. 
Time-invariant uncertainties introduce a dependency betw een consecutive observations of the same defect; 
for example, if a defect is in a location that mak es it harder than usual to detect, it will decrease the 
probability of detection for all inspec tions of that defect. Most studies assume that these dependencies can be 
neglected, or even if they state that modeling of  the dependency is important, they still model the 
observations as independent and give no guidance on how to model the te mporal dependency. The temporal 
dependency can become important when frequent inspec tions or online monitoring is applied for sequential 
Bayesian updating of a deterioration model. For exampl e, if a PoD curve was used to model the monitoring 
reliability, dependency could be introduced through ti me-invariant uncertainty on a parameter in the PoD 
model, e.g. the expected size of detectable defect s. When the observations are assumed independent, the 
probability of detection stays the same for each c onsecutive observation (with fixed damage size), and 
repeated observations with no indicati on of damage lead to higher confidence in the structure being healthy. 
If instead the observations were fully correlated, a dditional observations after the initial observation would 
not give new information and would not influence the d ecision makers’ belief of the health of the structure. 
The reality would most likely be something in betwee n these two boundaries. The aim of this paper is to 
investigate the importance of acknowledging the depende ncy between temporally distributed monitoring 
observations of the same defect when the Bayesian decision theory is applied. First, section “Modeling 
temporally dependent monitoring observations” presents a generic monitoring model that includes temporal 
dependency, and in the section “Methodology for VoI asse ssment”, the monitoring model is implemented in 
a Bayesian risk-based decision framework using Baye sian networks. Section “Numerical experiment” 
investigates the potential importance of acknowledgi ng the temporal dependency between monitoring 
observations through an example and parameter study, and the conclusions are drawn in section 
“Conclusions”. 
Modeling temporally depende nt monitoring observations 
This section considers monitoring methods for which the ob servation is continuous and is an indicator of the 
damage size or health state. For most monitoring sy stems, e.g. vibration-based CM or SHM, the direct 
measurements will be high-fre quency signals. To detect damage, various  methods can be applied to derive a 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
single variable, which is related to the component hea lth, often referred to as the damage index. For CM of 
the drivetrain of a wind turbine, a short time series is  usually recorded e.g. once a day when the turbine is 
operating within specified conditions. Methods such as enve lope analysis are used to derive a single variable, 
which is related to the component health, e.g. the crest factor or a root mean square (RMS) value. The alarm 
threshold is set as the mean plus a factor times the st andard deviation of the signal. For vibration-based 
SHM, several acceleration signals from spatially di stributed sensors are often used. Tcherniak and 
Mølgaard47 used the elements of the covariance matrix between  the signals to form a statistical model of the 
healthy state, and the Mahalanobis distance from the health y state to the current stat e was used as the damage 
index. Thresholds for the damage index are of ten set based on the allowed false alarm rate.  
Generally, the damage index will have  a lower frequency than the signal, for example, a measurement per 
day. If a probabilistic relationship be tween the damage state and damage index is known, the deterioration 
model can be updated using Bayesian methods each time an observation is received. However, for a 
Bayesian decision model, the computation time will be la rge if decisions are included for time steps with a 
duration of one day. A more appropriate time step for d ecisions is weeks or months, and therefore all damage 
indices received in each time step can be summarized into  one variable, e.g. a mean or maximum value, as 
illustrated in Figure 1.  
 
Figure 1: Principle for obtaining the monitori ng observation used for updating the model. 
The aim of this section is to establish a probabilistic monitoring model allowing for Bayesian updating of a 
deterioration model using outcomes of the damage inde x, where the temporal dependencies in the model are 
included. Thus, a monitoring model is here understood  as a probabilistic model relating the outcome of the 
monitoring system to the health of the considered component.  
It is assumed that the uncertainty on the mapping from damage index X to damage size D can be divided into 
two contributions: random noise and model uncertainty . The random noise is assumed normally distributed 
with mean zero and standard deviation 𝜎, and realizations are independe nt. The model uncertainty is 
modeled using the time-in variant model parameter 𝐿. In the case of independent observations, the expected 
value of the damage index X will only be conditioned on damage size D, and 𝑋ሺ𝐷ሻ  will follow a normal 
distribution around this value. 
𝑓௑|஽ሺ𝑥|𝐷ሻൌ𝑁ሺ𝐸ሾ𝑋 |𝐷ሿ,𝜎ሻ ሺ1ሻ 
When outcomes are dependent, the expected value of the damage index X will depend on both damage size 
D and model parameter L: 
𝑓௑|஽,௅ሺ𝑥|𝐷,𝐿ሻൌ𝑁ሺ𝐸ሾ𝑋 |𝐷,𝐿ሿ,𝜎ሻ ሺ2ሻ 
The distribution function of 𝑋 given 𝐷 and 𝐿 is then:  
𝐹௑|஽,௅ሺ𝑥|𝐷,𝐿ሻൌΦ൬𝑥െ𝐸ሾ𝑋 |𝐷,𝐿ሿሿ
𝜎൰ ሺ3ሻ 
This distribution can in principle be used for Ba yesian updating each time a monitoring observation is 
received. However, as the time scale for decision ma king is longer than the time scale for receiving 
monitoring outcomes, it is more convenient to update based on a statistical quantity (typically the sample Monitoring signals

where 𝑛 is the number of measurements used to compute the mean 𝑋ത. This is valid if 𝐷 and 𝐿 do not change 
significantly during the averaging period, as the outcom es of the random error are assumed independent and 
normally distributed with a known standard deviation 𝜎. The averaging period shou ld therefore be chosen 
based on the deterioration model. 
If the distribution for the monitoring observation 𝐼ெ is discretized into 𝑘 intervals with upper bounds 𝑥̅௞, the 
conditional probability of obtaining an outcome in interval 𝑘 is found by: 
𝑃൫𝐼ெ,௞ห𝐷,𝐿൯ ൌ  𝐹ሺ𝑥̅௞|𝐷,𝐿ሻെ𝐹ሺ𝑥̅௞ିଵ|𝐷,𝐿ሻ ሺ5ሻ 
The expected value of the monitoring outcome depends on damage size 𝐷 and parameter 𝐿. For example, a 
linear dependency between the expected valu e of the monitoring outcome and the product 𝐷𝐿 can be written 
as: 
𝐸ሾ𝑋 |𝐷,𝐿ሿ ൌ 𝜇 ଴൅𝑘𝐷𝐿  ሺ6ሻ 
where 𝜇଴ and 𝑘 are constants. The constant 𝜇଴ is the mean value of the damage index for a healthy 
component, and the constant 𝑘 is the increase of the damage index per unit increase in damage size for a 
defect where the parameter L is equal to one. The type of func tional relationship would depend on the 
specific problem. 
Estimation of model base d on knowledge and data 
To use the monitoring model describ ed above, knowledge  of the function 𝐸ሾ𝑋 |𝐷,𝐿ሿ, the standard deviation 𝜎 
of the damage index, and the prior distribution of L are needed. The model assumes that the standard 
deviation of the damage index is i ndependent of the damage size and depe ndency parameter. If this is the 
case, the standard deviation can be estimated from data  after a run-in period with a healthy component. If 
this is not the case, this dependence should be in cluded in the model and should be found based on 
experience. The functional relation between the expected value of the monitoring outcome and 𝐷 and 𝐿 
could be estimated based on experi ence, experiments, or models.  
Methodology for VoI assessment 
To investigate the importance of including temporal  dependencies on the value of SHM, the monitoring 
model presented in the previous section was implem ented in a framework for risk-based operation and 
maintenance planning that was origina lly published by Nielsen and Sørensen4. The framework uses a 
discrete Bayesian network formulation for the probabilistic  modeling, and in the original version, monitoring 
observations were assumed temporally  independent. In this section, the main features of the computational 
framework are summarized, and the implementation of th e monitoring model with temporal dependencies is 
presented. 
Bayesian network model 
Bayesian networks provide an efficient way to mode l deterioration and to perform Bayesian updating using 
measurements48. In the general case, where various types of distributions are applied, inference can be 
performed using sampling-based methods49 or efficient exact inference met hods can be used if all variables 
are discrete50. The latter approach can also be used for models with continuous variables if they are 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
discretized, and thus an approximation is made. Bayesi an networks consist of no des representing stochastic 
variables and links representing causal relationshi ps. The dependencies are quantified through the 
conditional probability distributions specified for each node, conditioned on the parent nodes. An elaborate 
introduction can be found in Jensen and Nielsen51. 
Generally, deterioration can be mode led using dynamic Bayesian networks , which consist of identical time 
slices, each only connected to the following and previ ous time slice. Thereby a Markov chain is made, and if 
all variables in a present slice are observed, knowledge of previous time slices does not change the belief of 
the future. However, the deterioration process does not n eed to be Markovian to be modeled in this way; 
time-invariant model parameters can be included in each  time step, causing the future damage size to be 
dependent on the past given the present. Figure 2 show s a Bayesian network for a deterioration model with 
damage size D and time-invariant model parameter M. Additionally, a node for the monitoring outcome 𝐼ெ is 
shown for the case where observations are independent, as in Nielsen and Sørensen4. This is modeled by a 
link pointing from the damage size to the monitoring observation, indicating that the monitoring outcome 
only depends on the damage size, and the monitoring models are specified as the conditional probability 
distribution  𝑃ሺ𝐼ெ,௜|𝐷௜ሻ, where index i denotes the time step.  
 
Figure 2: Bayesian network for damage size D, model parameter M, and monitoring outcome IM, when monitoring 
outcomes are not temporally dependent. 
To include temporal dependency between observatio ns as described in the section “Modeling temporally 
dependent monitoring observations”,  the monitoring model parameter 𝐿, is added, as shown in Figure 3, 
Here, the conditional probability distribution for the monitoring observation is specified by 𝑃ሺ𝐼ெ,௜|𝐷௜,𝐿௜ሻ, as 
in Eq. (5). This means that the monitoring observation is a stochastic variable that follows a distribution that 
depends on both D and L. In this model, there is no depe ndency between the model parameter M for the 
deterioration and the model parameter L for the monitoring observation. If both are affected by a common 
parameter, e.g. the location, it could be relevant to in troduce an additional node that is a parent of both, but 
this is not included in the present study.

For the Bayesian network shown in Figure 3, exact infe rence can be performed efficiently if all variables are 
discretized. The algorithms presented below are inspired by Straub48 and Murphy50 and make use of 
conditional independenci es between variables. 
The network is defined in terms of the prior distributions 𝑃ሺ𝑀଴ሻ, 𝑃ሺ𝐷଴ሻ and 𝑃ሺ𝐿଴ሻ for the deterioration 
model parameter, initial damage size, and monitori ng model parameter, and the conditional probability 
distributions 𝑃ሺ𝑀௜|𝑀௜ିଵሻ, 𝑃ሺ𝐿௜|𝐿௜ିଵሻ, 𝑃ሺ𝐷௜|𝐷௜ିଵ,𝑀௜ሻ, and 𝑃ሺ𝐼ெ,௜|𝐷௜,𝐿௜ሻ.  
Prediction of future deterioration is performed  sequentially using the following expression, where 
elementwise multiplication is performed  for multidimensional distributions: 
𝑃ሺ𝐷௜,𝑀௜,𝐿௜ሻൌ෍𝑃ሺ𝐿௜|𝐿௜ିଵሻ෍𝑃ሺ𝐷௜|𝐷௜ିଵ,𝑀௜ሻ෍𝑃ሺ𝑀௜|𝑀௜ିଵሻ𝑃ሺ𝐷௜ିଵ,𝑀௜ିଵ,𝐿௜ିଵሻ

Bayesian updating using monitoring observations is performed using Bayes rule, which is expressed as: 
𝑃൫𝐷௜,𝑀௜,𝐿௜|𝐼ெ೔ൌ𝑖ெ,௜൯∝𝑃൫ 𝐷 ௜,𝑀௜,𝐿௜,𝐼ெ,௜ൌ𝑖ெ,௜൯ൌ𝑃ሺ𝐷௜,𝑀௜,𝐿௜ሻ𝑃൫𝐼ெ,௜ൌ𝑖ெ,௜ห𝐷௜,𝐿௜൯ ሺ8ሻ 
When monitoring observations are received in all time st eps, Eqs. (7) and (8) are used alternating with 
increasing 𝑖, and the joint distributions 𝑃ሺ𝐷௜,𝑀௜,𝐿௜ሻ are conditioned on all observations from all past time 
steps, although for simplicity this is not indicated in the notation applied. 
Strategies and decision rules 
The computational framework can be applied to find the optimal heuristic decision rules for timing of 
inspections and repairs, when monitoring is used, an d when it is not used, and thereby it allows for 
computation of the VoI of SHM. For inspections, the implemented decision rules include equidistant 
inspections, inspection when a threshold for the monito ring observation is exceeded, and inspection when the 
probability of failure is exceeded. Re pairs can also be equidistant, based on inspection outcome, or based on 
an estimate of the probability of failure. A strategy cons ists of a decision rule for when to inspect and one for 
when to repair. In this paper three types of strategi es are used, where the decisi on rules for inspections are 
given by: 
1) Inspection interval for equidistant inspections 
2) Threshold for monitoring observation to initialize inspections 
3) Threshold for the probability of failure to initialize inspections 
For all three strategies, preventive repairs are made when  a threshold for the inspection outcome is exceeded.  
To estimate the expected lifetime costs for a given stra tegy and selected decision rules, the probability of 
inspection, repair, and failure for each time step duri ng the planned lifetime is found using decision models 1 
and 2 as described below. 
Decision model 1: Bayesian network 
For the simple strategies (1 and 2), the decisions are ma de based on a directly observable value, e.g. the latest 
monitoring or inspection outcome. These decision ru les are formulated as discrete conditional probability 
distributions, where all probabilities are either zero or one. In this way, the decisions on inspections and 
repairs are included directly in the Bayesian networ k model in the nodes for the decisions. In Figure 4, a 
Bayesian network is shown for strategy 2: ‘inspect when the monitoring outcome exceeds the threshold’ and 
‘repair when the inspection outcome exceeds the threshold’. Forward com putations as in Eq. (7) are used, 
and the probability distribution is estimated for each node . The probability of inspection, repair, and failure 
in each time step is found from the nodes 𝐼஽,௜. 𝑅௜ and 𝐷௜. For strategy 1, the nodes 𝐼ெ,௜ and L are omitted, and 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
the distributions for the nodes 𝐼஽,௜ are directly set to a probability of in spection equal to one when inspections 
are to be made according to the inspection interval, and zero when they should not be made. 
 
Figure 4: Bayesian network for decision model 1 with damage size D, damage size after potential repair DR, model 
parameter M, monitoring outcome IM, monitoring model parameter L, inspection outcome I, inspection decision ID, and 
repair decision R. 
Decision model 2: Monte Carlo simulations and Bayesian network 
For advanced strategies, where a threshold for the proba bility of failure is used, the decision rule cannot be 
included directly in the Bayesian networks model. In stead, Monte Carlo simulations are used to estimate the 
probability of inspection, repair, and failure in each timestep. Lifetimes of outcomes of the stochastic 
variables are simulated from the discrete conditional pr obability distributions also used in the Bayesian 
network formulation. Within the simulations, the Bayesian  network shown in Figure 5 is used to update the 
distributions using the same principles as in Eqs. (7) a nd (8) each time a monitoring or inspection outcome is 
simulated. Whenever a decision is to be made, the pr obability of failure within a reference period (e.g. one 
time step) is estimated based on the updated deterioration and monitoring model, and the decision is made 
based on this estimate. To use this st rategy in practice, the decision-maker  will need to have a system where 
the probabilistic Bayesian network model is regularly  updated using observations so that it can recommend 
decisions based on decided strategies. This syst em can be seen as a simple digital twin.

parameter M, monitoring outcome IM, monitoring model parameter L, inspection outcome I, inspection decision ID, and

Estimation of total expected costs and VoI 
The outcomes of the decision models described in the pr evious subsections are the probability of inspection, 
repair, and failure, for each time step 𝑡, dependent on decision rules 𝒅. In the following, these are denoted by 
𝑃ூሺ𝑡,𝒅ሻ, 𝑃ோሺ𝑡,𝒅ሻ, and 𝑃ிሺ𝑡,𝒅ሻ respectively. For the strategy with equidistant inspections, the probability of 
inspection will be either zero or one for all time steps,  as the decision parameters fully define the inspection

times. For the other strategies, the inspection times wi ll depend on the monitoring outcomes and the times of 
future inspections will therefore be uncertain.  
The expected lifetime costs to in spections, repairs, and failures, 𝐸ሾ𝐶ሺ𝒅ሻሿ , can be estimated by the following 
summation over the number of time steps 𝑇: 
𝐸ሾ𝐶ሺ𝒅ሻሿൌ෍ ൫ 𝑐 ூሺ𝑡ሻ𝑃ூሺ𝑡,𝒅ሻ൅𝑐ோሺ𝑡ሻ𝑃ோሺ𝑡,𝒅ሻ൅𝑐ிሺ𝑡ሻ𝑃ிሺ𝑡,𝒅ሻ൯்
௧ୀଵ ሺ9ሻ 
where 𝑐ூሺ𝑡ሻ, 𝑐ோሺ𝑡ሻ, and 𝑐ிሺ𝑡ሻ are the specific cost of an inspection, a repair, and a failure at time 𝑡. 
Normally, a discount factor is included in these terms, which makes them dependent on the time 𝑡. However, 
with time, stationarity will set in for structures that are regularly maintained according to a fixed strategy. 
When all costs are distributed approximately uniformly in  time, the discount factor will not affect the optimal 
strategy, as all cost contributions are affected equally.  
For each strategy, ranges of possible values for each decision rule parameter (intervals and thresholds) are 
defined. The expected lifetime costs are estimated fo r each combination using the decision models and Eq. 
(9). For each strategy, the optimal combination of deci sion rules is where the lowest expected lifetime costs 
are obtained. The VoI of monitoring is estimated as th e difference in expected lifetime costs for strategy 1 
and strategy 2 or 3 when the optimal combinations of decision rules are used for each strategy. If the use of 
monitoring leads to lower costs, the VoI will be positi ve. The costs of a monitoring system are not included 
in the estimated costs, and the Vo I is therefore a measure of the maximum price that is economically 
justifiable to spend on purchasing, installing, ope rating, and maintaining a monitoring system.  
Numerical experiment 
The aim of this numerical experime nt is to investigate the effect of dependency/correlation between 
monitoring outcomes on the VoI. Obviously, the best r esults will always be obtained by the model that 
represents the reality most accurately. However, th e decision-maker generally does not have perfect 
knowledge of reality, and models will always be simplifications of the reality. Often dependency is omitted 
due to the difficulties in including it, and the presu mption that it is a fair assumption to neglect it.  
In this numerical experiment, it is assumed that m onitoring outcomes are temporally dependent due to a 
time-invariant model parameter in the monitoring model. Th e monitoring system is able to detect defects that 
are similar, but in slightly different locations, and th e specific location of an initiated defect affects the 
monitoring model parameter. The ove rall variation of the model parame ter is known from test campaigns. 
The decision-maker wrongly assumes that all the detected variation is random, and he makes decisions and 
estimates VoI with support from a model built on these assu mptions. The aim is to estimate: i) the VoI he 
expects to get, ii) the VoI he could obtain if he had included dependency correctly, and iii) the VoI he would 
actually get when using the wrong model.  
First, the models and methodology are presented. Then the results for the base case are presented, which is 
followed by a parameter study in order to derive mo re general conclusions on when the dependency will 
have the most influence on the VoI.  
Probabilistic models 
The intention of this example is to construct a flexible  model, where parameters can be adjusted to reflect 
various deteriorations models, degree of dependencies, etc. The example is inspired by the case of SHM of 
wind turbine blades, where defects are often categoriz ed in discrete states depending on their severity 42,52,53. 
The example follows the assumptions on deterioration a nd inspection model used in the example in Nielsen 
and Sørensen4, except for the monitoring model, and th e main assumptions are repeated here. 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
The time step used in the model is one month, and th e planned lifetime is 20 years. The deterioration model 
is defined by the distributions 𝑃ሺ𝐷଴ሻ, 𝑃ሺ𝑀଴ሻ, 𝑃൫𝐷௜|𝐷ோ,௜ିଵ,𝑀௜൯, and 𝑃ሺ𝑀௜|𝑀௜ିଵሻ. The variable for the 
damage size, 𝐷, has seven states, where the last state is ‘fault’, and initially , it is in the first state. For the 
base case, the transition probability is the same for each state of D, and the expected value of the transition 
probability is found such that the mean time to failure  is 20 years. Uncertainty on the transition probability 
(and thereby defect growth rate) is modeled by multip lying the expected value of the transition probability 
by the time-invariant parameter, M. The parameter M can take values 0.7, 1.0, 1.3, and the prior distribution 
is uniform. The inspection model is described by the distribution 𝑃ሺ𝐼௜|𝐷௜,𝐼஽,௜ሻ. For inspections, the 
probability of detection for the damage states are respectiv ely 0, 0.4, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95, 0.98, and 1, and if a 
defect is detected, it is quantified correctly in stat e 1 to 7. No dependency is assumed between inspections. 
For further explanation of the models, see Nielsen and Sørensen4.  
Monitoring model 
The monitoring model used in the example is based on the model presented in section “Modeling temporally 
dependent monitoring observations”. The expected valu e of the damage index is assumed to be proportional 
to the damage size D, and to the time-invariant monitoring model parameter L: 𝐸ሾ𝑋 |𝐷,𝐿ሿ. The time-invariant 
monitoring parameter L can take values from zero to one. It is zero if the defect does not influence the expected 
value of the monitoring outcome, and it is one if it h as the maximum possible influence. Numerical values are 
assigned to the discrete damage states by assuming that the l ast state ‘fault’ is entered at a damage size of one, 
the lower bound for the first state is zero, and the six non -faulty states are of equal size. The random noise part 
of the uncertainty of has a standard deviation of 0.2, and the number of samples in each month is assumed to 
30. 
The monitoring model is defined by the probability distributions:  
 𝑃ሺ𝐿଴ሻ: prior probability distribution of time-invariant monitoring model parameter 𝐿଴ 
 𝑃ሺ𝐿௜|𝐿௜ିଵ,𝑅௜ିଵሻ: conditional probability distribution for parameter L in time step 𝑖 given the value 
of parameter L and the repair decision R in the previous time step 
 𝑃ሺ𝐼ெ,௜|𝐷௜,𝐿௜ሻ: conditional probability distribution for monitoring outcome 𝐼ெ given damage size D 
and parameter L 
In the base case,  L is assumed to follow a uniform distribution over th e values 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0. As 
the parameter is assumed time-invariant between repair s, the conditional probability distribution for the 
decision ‘no repair’, 𝑃ሺ𝐿௜|𝐿௜ିଵ,𝑅௜ିଵൌ0ሻ, is equal to the identity matrix. In case of repair, the distribution 
for Li is equal to the prior distribution, 𝑃ሺ𝐿଴ሻ, regardless of Li-1, because the parameter is assumed to depend 
on the specifics of the initiated defect.  
The updating is based on the mean of the outcomes receiv ed in a time step (a month), and the distribution 
𝑃ሺ𝐼ெ,௜|𝐷௜,𝐿௜ሻ is evaluated using Eqs. (4) and (5). With  these assumptions and the interval boundaries in 
Table 1, the monitoring model for dependent observations  is found. The model is given by the conditional 
probability distribution 𝑃ሺ𝐼ெ,௜|𝐷௜,𝐿௜ሻ, which is illustrated in Figure 6(a). The colors indicate the probability 
of each monitoring observation, given damage size and parameter L. They are influenced by the distance 
from the product DL to each of the monitoring thresholds (given in Table 1), the standard deviation of the 
sample, and the number of samples. The dependency introduces correlation between consecutive monitoring 
outcomes, but not full correlation, as there is also a variation due to the random noise. For the case where all 
variation is random, the observations  are uncorrelated. Here, the same  overall variation of monitoring 
outcomes is assumed as for the model with temporal dependency, and the distribution 𝑃ሺ𝐼ெ,௜|𝐷௜ሻ is obtained

Cost model 
The specific costs are normalized with respect to the inspection costs, such  that the inspection costs are equal 
to 1. For the base case, the costs of a preventive repair are set to 37.5, a nd the costs of a corrective repair are 
500. These relative specific costs correspond to the costs used in Nielsen and Sørensen4. All costs shown in 
the following are therefore relative co sts. The costs of purchasing, operating, and maintaining the monitoring 
system are not included but should be added to the costs obtained for strategies that use monitoring.  
Methodology  
The influence of dependency between monitoring obser vations on the VoI will depend on how they are used 
for decision making. Three strategies for inspection planning are considered: 
1) Equidistant inspections 
2) Inspection upon exceedance of thres hold for the monitoring outcome 
3) Inspection upon exceedance of threshol d for the probability of failure 
Strategy 1 is included to estimate the expected lifetim e costs without monitoring, as this is needed for the 
assessment of the VoI of monitoring. Strategy 2 a nd 3 represent the use of a simple and an advanced 
monitoring-based inspection strategy respectively. For all strategies, preventive repairs are made when a 
threshold for the inspection outcome is exceeded. As th e damage size is quantified correctly in the case of 
detection, this is also a threshold for the state for th e damage size. Therefore, for each strategy, there are two 
decision parameters: one for decisions on inspections  (inspection interval, monitoring threshold, or 
probability of failure threshold), and one for repairs (damage state threshold).  
The VoI will be estimated both when measurements are independent/uncorrelated ( un), and when they are 
dependent/correlated (co). A dditionally, the VoI will be estimated wh en measurements are in fact dependent 
but are wrongly assumed to be independent (co*). The e xpected lifetime costs are est imated for the following 
seven combinations of strategy and assumptions on the correlation between monitoring observations: 
 1: no monitoring 
 2-un: uncorrelated/inde pendent observations 
 2-co: correlated/dependent observations 
 2-co*: correlated observations, assumed uncorrelated when making decisions 
 3-un: uncorrelated/inde pendent observations 
 3-co: correlated/dependent observations 
 3-co*: correlated observations, assumed uncorrelated when making decisions 
For the case of independent observations (un), the orig inal framework without the time-invariant monitoring 
model parameter L is used for identifying the optimal decision rules and associated expected costs. For the 
case with dependent/correlated ob servations (co), the extended framework with the parameter L included is 
used for identifying the optimal deci sion rules and associated expected costs. For the third case (co*), where 
monitoring observations are in fact dependent, but deci sions are made assuming that they are independent, 
the optimal decision rules identified in the independe nt case are used. For decision model 1, the expected 
costs are simply found by using the Bayesian networ k model (Figure 4) from the extended framework with 
the decision rules found using the original model. For decision model 2, Monte Carlo simulations are made 
by drawing samples from the extende d model with dependency parameter L. But the Bayesian network used 
as a simple digital twin for decision making within simu lations is the one from the original model, and the 
decision rules used are the optimal ones identified using the original framework. 
Results of the base case 
First, the expected lifetime costs are estimated for st rategy 1, where equidistant inspections are made. The 
expected lifetime costs are estimated for 45 combinations  of inspection interval and threshold for repairs as 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
shown in Figure 7. The costs are found directly usin g Bayesian networks using exact inference algorithms, 
and the computed expected values are therefore exact given the input. The lowest costs are obtained when 
inspections are performed every 12 months, and repairs are made when a defect in state 5 or above is 
detected. The costs are 64.39 times the cost of an inspection. 
 
Figure 7. Expected lifetime costs for strate gy 1 for inspection intervals from 3 to 60 months. For each inspection interval, 
five bars are shown for damage state thresh olds for repairs 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. 
For strategy 2, decisions on inspections are made based on the state of the monitoring outcome. As for 
strategy 1, the exact expected costs are found using Bayesian networks. Figure 8 shows the relative expected 
lifetime costs for 30 combinations of thresholds for inspections and repairs for the cases when monitoring 
outcomes are uncorrelated and correlated.  
For uncorrelated observations, the lowest costs (46.66) ar e obtained at the monitoring threshold 4, and damage 
state threshold 5. Here, there are almost no failures. Ho wever, if the monitoring observations are correlated, 
much more failures are generally seen, as low values of the parameter L will lead to defects not being detected. 
The lowest costs (154.12) are obtained when the monitori ng threshold is 2 and the damage state threshold is 
3. If the optimal strategy for uncorrelated observations is used, the costs are 181.73.

states of monitoring observations 1 to 6, and for each thre shold, five bars are shown for damage state thresholds for

For strategy 3, decisions on inspections are made base d on the probability of failure within a time step (one 
month). Using 10 000 simulations, the relative expected lifetime costs shown in Figure 9 were obtained. The 
costs are shown for 40 combinations of the threshold fo r the probability of failure and threshold for repairs 
for the cases, when monitoring observations are uncorrelate d, correlated, and when they are correlated, but 
decisions are made assuming that they are uncorrelated. 
For uncorrelated observations, the lowest costs are 46 and for correlated they ar e 47. For both observations, 
the optimal threshold for the probability of failure is 3⋅10ିସ, and the optimal threshold for the damage state 
for repairs is 5. If the monitoring observations are correlated but are assumed uncorrelated when decisions 
are made, the expected costs are 184. Although much  higher than the costs obtained in the optimal 
preventive strategy, it is still less than the costs obtai ned when using only correctiv e maintenance, which is 
285.

the difference between the costs for strategy 1, and the co sts for each of the other strategies. As the costs of 
the monitoring system are not included, these are also  the maximum total lifetime costs of a monitoring 
system that would be feasible to install. Negative VoI im plies that it is better not to use monitoring at all than 
to use that strategy.

Figure 10. Expected costs (a) and VoI (b) for strategy 1 and for strategies 2 and 3 for monitoring observations that are 
uncorrelated (un), correlated (co), and correlated but assumed uncorrelated (co*). 
For uncorrelated observations, both st rategies 2 and 3 give a decrease in costs and VoI around 18. For 
correlated observations, strategy 3 still performs very well, and a VoI of around 17 is obtained. However, 
using strategy 2 with correlated observations causes a s ubstantial increase in the costs, and thereby a negative 
VoI of around -90. The reason that strategy 3 perform s so well is that the probability distribution for the 
parameter L is also updated, each time observations are received , thus the distribution is learned. As such the 
decision model acknowledges the probability of defects, even if the monitoring system shows no increase in 
measurements. When the observations are assumed uncorrela ted but are in fact correlated, the VoI is around 
-120 for both strategies 2 and 3. This clearly indicates that it can be very important to include the 
dependency in the model; neglecting it can cause monitori ng to increase costs instead of decreasing costs, 
and the estimated VoI will be incorrect.  
Parameter study 
To investigate the generality of the tendencies obser ved in the base case, a parameter study is performed. 
Variables are changed, one at a time, and the optim al strategies and expected costs are found for each

combination of strategy and assumptions on correlati on, in the same way as for the base case. To reduce 
computation time for strategy 3, only values of the probability of failure 10-8, 10-7, 10-6, 10-5, 10-4, 10-3, 10-2 
and values for the damage state thresholds 4, 5, and 6 are used.    
Changes related to the following seven points are cons idered, where 1 to 4 are related to the monitoring 
model.  
1) Relation between monitoring outcome and damage size 
2) Standard deviation of damage index 
3) Shape of prior distribution of parameter L 
4) Minimum value of parameter L 
5) Deterioration model shape 
6) Mean time to failure 
7) Specific costs  
Relation between monitoring outcome and damage size  
The base case assumed linear dependency between damage size and the expected value of monitoring signal: 
𝐸ሾ𝑋 |𝐷,𝐿ሿ ൌ 𝐷𝐿 . Instead, a non-linear relation could exist, wher e smaller defects are harder to detect. The 
following exponential model reflects this behavior: 
𝐸ሾ𝑋 |𝐷,𝐿ሿ ൌexp൫𝑐௘௫௣𝐷൯െ 1 
exp൫𝑐௘௫௣൯െ1 𝐿 ሺ11ሻ 
Where cexp is a constant, determining the shape. Figure 11 s hows how the constant affects the shape of the 
function 𝐸ሾ𝑋 |𝐷,𝐿ሿ. Is can be seen that the relationship is closer to linear for small values cexp, and for cexp 
=0.1 the relationship is practically linear. 
Figure 12 shows the costs obtained for each strategy and assumption on the correlation for five values of cexp. 
It is seen that an exponential relationship between  damage size and monitoring observation increases the 
feasibility of the three infeasible strategy-correlation combinations, although the VoI is still negative (the 
costs are higher than for strategy 1 without monitori ng). For the uncorrelated cases, the costs would also 
decrease slightly. Exponential behavior  is beneficial because inspections ar e only carried out when there is a 
defect that should be repaired and still only a few fa ilures occur. If preventive re pair costs were assumed to 
increase with damage size, instead of being constant, it  could be feasible to repair earlier, and exponential 
behavior could be less beneficial. In contrast to the other strategies, for correlated observations in strategy 3, 
the costs were found to increase slightly with behavior that is more exponential. This could be because the 
late increase (in terms of damage size) of monitoring observations makes it harder to update the dependency 
parameter, because an increase is not e xpected until quite late, leading to both slightly more inspections and 
slightly more failures.

Figure 12. Expected lifetime costs as a function of cexp for exponential dependency between expected monitoring 
outcome and damage size (b ase case value: ~0.1). 
Standard deviation of damage index 
The base case assumed a standard deviation of the damage index 𝜎 equal of 0.2, and the number n of 
samples per time step was 30. Multiplying the standard deviation by a factor x gives the same effect as 
reducing the number of samples by a factor of 𝑥ଶ, as the sample distribution for the mean of normally 
distributed signals has the standard deviation ఙ
√௡. Figure 13 shows the influence of increasing or decreasing 
the standard deviation.  
For the three feasible strategies, the co sts are increased when the standard deviation is of the damage index is 
increased as expected. Surprisingly, for the infeasible strategy 2, for correlated measurements, increasing the 
standard deviation leads to a decrea se in costs. Increasing the standard deviation leads to more inspections 
and preventive repairs, and fewer failures, and an optimal  strategy with lower costs is obtained. This suggests 
that combining this strategy with inspections occurring  almost randomly actually makes it better. In the case 
of correlated observations, an alternative to the advanced  strategy using the probability of failure could be a 
strategy combining equidistant inspections with monitori ng, such that some inspections are still made after a 
given period, even if the monitoring system does not indicate the presence of defects. This would reduce the 
number of defects with low values of the parameter L developing to failure.

Shape of prior distribution of parameter L 
For the base case, the dependency parameter L was assumed to have a uniform prior. If instead a triangular 
distribution is assumed, this would reduce or increase th e probability of low or high values. Three cases, with 
an increasing expected value of L, are considered here: 
 Linearly decreasing triangular distribution (zero probability of L=1) 
 Uniform distribution (base case) 
 Linearly increasing triangular distribution (zero probability of L=0) 
Figure 14 shows the costs obtained in the three cases.  The uncorrelated cases are also affected, as the 
monitoring model for uncorrelated observa tions is computed using Eq. (10). 
For most strategies, the costs decr ease when the expected value of L increase, and vice versa if it decreases. 
However, for strategy 3, when correlated observatio ns are assumed to be uncorrelated, both triangular 
distributions give smaller costs than the uniform. This could be because the variance of the dependency 
parameter is smaller when a triangular distribution is used.  
 
Figure 14. Expected lifetime costs as a f unction of the shape of the prior distri bution of L (base case value: uniform). 
Minimum value of parameter L 
In the base case, the minimum value of the parameter L was assumed to be zero. If the minimum value is 
increased, and the prior is still assumed to be uniform, the costs are affected as shown in Figure 15. 
Intuitively, having a low probability of low values of the parameter L should lead to decreased costs, as 
defects will generally be easier to detect. As expect ed, the costs are seen to decrease when the minimum 
value of L is increased; although, there is a local increase at a minimum value of 0.6 for strategy 2 with 
correlated outcomes assumed to be uncorrelated. The r eason for this is that here the optimal decision 
parameters for the uncorrelated case change from 4 to 5, which is unfavorable for the correlated case. When 
the minimum value of the dependency parameter is increas ed to 0.8, all strategies result in positive VoI. 
Strategy 3 with correlated monitoring observations – assu med uncorrelated – gives onl y slightly higher costs 
than the three best strategies and is better than usin g the simple strategy 2, considering the correlation. 
However, if the minimum value of the dependency para meter is 0.6, strategy 2 with correlated monitoring 
observations still gives positive VoI, unlike both of the st rategies in which the corre lation is present, but not 
accounted for.

Deterioration model shape 
For the base case, the transition probability was assume d constant, corresponding to linear damage growth 
and constant mean sojourn time. Fo r deterioration models with increasi ng transition probability, the sojourn 
time is decreasing, and vice versa. For this parameter study, the mean sojourn time is assumed to increase or 
decrease linearly with damage size. Th e mean time to failure is kept constant, and the transition probabilities 
are fully defined when the increase in sojourn time per stat e is defined. For convenience, this will be referred 
to as the deterioration growth para meter. Values above one give a conve x damage model, and values below 
one give a concave model. As seen in Figure 16, th e general tendency is that costs decrease when the 
deterioration growth parameter incr ease; although for some strategies, it begins increasing again. Increasing 
the deterioration growth parameter gi ves a similar effect as when having an exponential relationship between 
damage sizes and monitoring observations; a higher deteri oration growth parameter gives lower costs. The 
reason is that it is then easier to repair defects as late as possible before failure, as thresholds based on 
damage size are used. When increasing the deterioration gr owth parameter, most strategies will generate less 
preventive repairs and inspections (for strategies 2 a nd 3) but more failures for each set of decision 
parameters.

Mean time to failure 
For the base case, the mean time to failure was 20 years.  Figure 17 shows the effect of increased mean time 
to failure. A logarithmic ordinate axis is used, as the costs for all strategies are generally decreased 
significantly, when the mean time to failure is increas ed. This is expected, as the probability of failure and 
consequently, the need for repairs are reduced. For higher mean time to failure, the strategy without 
monitoring performs worse than all strategies with m onitoring, but apart from that, the ratio between the 
costs for the strategies remains approximately constant.    
 
Figure 17. Expected lifetime costs as a function of mean time to failure in years (base case value: 20). 
Specific costs 
In the base case, the specific costs were defined relative to the costs of an inspection, such that the cost of a 
preventive repair was 37.5, and the cost of failure was 500. To assess the influence of changing the specific 
costs, each of the costs is in turn  multiplied by a factor ranging from 0.1 to 5, and the optimal decision 
parameters are identified for each cost. Figure 17 shows the influence on total expected costs and VoI, of 
changing the specific costs. Naturally, increasing any of th e specific costs generally l eads to increased costs. 
However, changing the specific costs shows no differen ce in how the strategies perform in relation to each 
other. Smaller inspection costs make strategy 2 better for correlated observations, but it is still worse than 
equidistant inspections, thus monitoring is not feasible. When reducing the specific failure costs to 50 (0.1 of 
the base case value), only a third higher than the cost of preventive repairs, all strategies converge to the 
same costs. Here, a minimum preventive effort is opt imal, and the costs are close to those obtained using 
corrective maintenance only, which are f ound to 28.5 for failure costs of 50.

Conclusions 
In this paper, the influence of temporal depende ncy between monitoring observations on the expected 
lifetime costs and the VoI is investigated. Dependenc y between measurements is introduced using a time-

Three strategies with heuristic decision rules are app lied for the estimation of expected lifetime costs: 
Strategy 1 without monitoring but with equidistant insp ections, strategy 2 where inspections are made when 
a threshold for the monitoring observation is exceeded, and the advanced strategy 3 where inspections are 
made when a threshold for the probability of failure is  exceeded. For strategies 1 and 2, Bayesian networks 
are used directly to estimate the costs. For strategy 3,  all past monitoring and inspection outcomes are used to 
update the probability of failure in each time step usi ng Bayesian networks, and Monte Carlo simulations are 
used to estimate the costs. 
The advanced strategy 3 generally performs very we ll for both uncorrelated and correlated observations. In 
fact, the presence of correlation generally only gives a minor increase in the expect ed lifetime costs, because 
the advanced model is able to learn the distribution of the time-invariant monitoring model parameter. The 
simpler strategy 2 performs similarly to strategy 3 for uncorrelated observations. However, in the case of 
highly correlated observations, it leads to much higher costs than when no monitoring was used at all, 
because many defects are not detected prior to failure, ev en if a small threshold is used. If decisions are made 
assuming uncorrelated measurements when they are in fact  correlated, it can lead to much higher costs than 
when no monitoring is used at all for both strategi es 2 and 3, as many failures will happen. The parameter 
study shows that if the uncertainty on the model parame ter is small, strategy 2 can be used for correlated 
measurements with good results, and assuming unc orrelated measurements in case of correlated 
measurements will be less critical; it will still give positive VoI.  
The main conclusion of this paper is that the presen ce of high dependency between monitoring observations 
due to high uncertainty on a time-invariant model para meter should not be neglected in a VoI analysis. 
Doing so can even lead to the realization of negativ e VoI. However, it is not straightforward to model 
accurately the dependency. If a sufficient amount of data is  available, learning algorithms can be applied, and 
here it is important to consider the possibility of time-invariant model parameters. The Bayesian network 
model presented in this paper provides an effici ent method for decision support which can include 
dependencies. As simulations are required for VoI assess ment and for finding the optimal strategy, this is 
quite time-demanding. But the updating required for deci sion support throughout the lifetime is based on 
exact inference algorithms and can be made fast and efficiently.
