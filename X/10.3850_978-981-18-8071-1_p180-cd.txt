The role of renewable energy has grown considerably in various regions of the world, particularly solar and wind energy sources. Both energy sources are capable to meet  energy requirements in an efficient and environmentally 
sustainable manner in solar and wind rich regions of the wo rld. South and north Asian regions are one of them, 
where solar and wind energy resources are utilized with the help of available energy conversion machines. The wind 
turbine is one of them and its various types have played a vital role in the utilization of wind energy in the industrial 
sector for power generation. Horizontal wind axis turbine is one such type and it is capable to achieve better power 
output plus energy efficiency. It is used therefore in large-scale wind electric power generation. Although, there are 
certain technical problems related to the performance of wind turbines, for instance bearing failure rate. Due to the failure of bearings and other parts of wind turbines, considerable costs of specialized maintenance have incurred on 
the purchase of parts, installation, and trained workmanshi p which contribute towards an increase in downtime of 
power generation.  Bearing faults are extremely complex and sometimes cannot be resolved using reconfigurable 
control. Therefore, early detection of bearing faults is critical to its performance and lower downtime. This paper 
investigates the requirements of bearing health and safety assessment. The assessment is based on the principles of 
estimation of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of bearing.  A proposed prognosis model of Reliability Health and 
Safety Analysis (RHSA) is used for the evaluation of the pe rformance of the bearing. The reliability model is used 
for the assessment of the useful life of the bearing su bsystem of the Horizontal axis wind turbine and early detection 
of RUL leads to improve the performance and to avoid its failures.   
Keywords:  Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT), Reliabilit y Health and Safety Analysis (RHSA), Remaining

1. Introduction 
Wind turbines are frequen tly positioned in severe 
environmental conditions, making their parts’ operation and maintenance difficult. The most 
vulnerable mechanical components in rotating 
machines are rolling elements like bearings[1]. A 
bearing failure can resu lt in a complete machine 
breakdown, causing unintended interruptions in production and financial losses. The Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of wi nd turbine bearings and 
gearbox are the major components in their 
maintenance and operation. It is critical to install 
an effective bearing Co ndition Monitoring (CM) 
and fault diagnosis system. So that incipient 
bearing faults can be d etected and diagnosed for preventing machine damage[2]. Such as early 
detection of a rolling element bearing defect in a high-speed wind turbine can lead to timely maintenance to avoid potentially disastrous 
consequences such as fire  and human loss caused 
by unexpected failure. Wind turbine bearing 
reliability and performance are critical for the long-term smooth operation of wind turbines under hazardous conditions. RUL prediction is one of the most important tool in decision-
making, for the prediction of time to failure of 
machine parts in advance. This makes it convenient for maintenance engineers to carry out qualitative risk analysis an d formulate successful 
maintenance strategies[3].

In the Wind Turbine Generation Systems (WTGs) 
inspections and maintenan ce are very important 
for the improvement of th e life span of a gearbox, 
bearings, blades, and other components of the wind turbine [4,5]. Parts such as the gearbox, generator, main bearing, blades, and tower cause 
sometimes unexpected downtimes and thus 
require the most attention of users. The wind turbine main bearing failure  may result in the rise 
in the cost of repair and maintenance [6]. The bearing failure can damage the drive train in the 
wind turbine generation. As a result, there is an 
increase in the cost of specialized maintenance, 
such as the cost incu rred on the installation of 
equipment, rigging plans, and trained workmanship. The bearing failure rate in wind turbines remains very high, up to 76% [7]. Wind 
farm operation and maintenance practices 
typically involve a combination of corrective (breakdown or reactive response) and preventive (periodic) maintenance  strategies. Preventive 
maintenance requires regu lar inspection and small 
maintenance actio ns in comparison to breakdown 
maintenance, which requires huge effort and time. 
It also facilitates to reduce repair, and other costs 
incurred on purchase of damaged components. 
Gear box and bearings are deteriorated with respect to time as per L
10 criteria due to wear and 
tear and such problem is serious in the offshore 
turbines due to decrease in lifespan from 20 years 
to 10 years[8]. The wind turbine main bearings are subject to a variety of  failure modes, such as 
wear rate of inner and outer  race faults, pitting, 
cracks, brinelling, and damage to the cage. The 
bearing health is the ratio of current time to failure 
time which illustrate the state of degradation. The failure modes are dependent on certain factors such as wind air density, ambient temperature, 
humidity, dust, risky climate conditions, and 
variation in the wind load due to rain, storm, and poor maintenance.  
Typically, the prediction of Remaining Useful 
Life (RUL) has been accomplished using various models such as Support Vector Regression (SVR) 
based on the well-known support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, Long Short-Term Memory 
(LSTM) models based on the architecture of 
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), as well as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) models. These models 
have been widely employed in RUL prediction 
tasks. While considering th e various models used for predicting Remaining Usef ul Life (RUL), it is 
important to note that each model has its 
limitations. For instance, the SVR model may encounter difficulties in  handling large datasets 
and capturing non-linear relationships, as it lacks the ability to automatically learn features[9]. On 
the other hand, LSTM m odels, which are based on 
the architecture of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), excel in hand ling sequential data. 
However, they may not be as flexible when it comes to non-sequential data [10].  It captures 
sequential dependencies by maintaining an 
internal memory state, so the training process is 
slower and takes more time than the other models. 
CNN model learns hier archically from image 
patches and abstract features in addition to that its architecture consists of multi hidden layers which 
makes the network complex and more 
challenging for features analysis[11]. DNN model is computationally ex pensive and complex 
because it requires a large amount of labeled training data to achieve good performance[12]. DNN is the best combination of hyperparameters, 
model hyperparameters mu st be tuned based on 
learning rate, batch size, number of layers, and 
activation function. If the d ata is small, there is a 
risk of overfitting during training, and the iterative process is time-consuming. Many authors are working on DNN to improve network 
performance. However, ANN is interchangeable 
with DNN, which has dem onstrated great success 
in a variety of applications by overcoming all limitations. ANN model is the reliable solution 
for the health monitoring of WTGs to enhance the 
life span of wind turbines  up to its estimated life. 
The reliability and health of bearing as a sub-component be ensured through time management of lubrication which avoids catastrophic bearing 
failures to avoid fire, premature gear box failure 
and other components.
       
2. Condition Monitoring System (CMS) 
Condition Monitoring (C M) and RUL showed a 
significant role to decrease downtime, leading to 
creating cost-saving opportunities. The condition monitoring of Wind Turbines (WT) based on 
vibration, noise, and temperature signals has been 
gaining significant attentio n in the past few years. 
The vibration monitoring of wind turbines is on 
the rise. Vibration monitori ng is used to detect 
bearing and gear faults based on AI and deep 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
430 Proceedings of the 33rd European Safety and Reliability Conference (ESREL 2023)
learning methodologies are gaining popularity in 
the age of automation and complex machines.  
 The RUL of a Wind Turbine component can be estimated by using ANNs. The CM as shown in Fig. 1., is based on mu ltivariate data si gnals such 
as vibration and temperature. Data acquisition is 
the primary part, and data is processed to the ANN 
model to identify the degradation and finally, RUL is calculated. The process as shown in Fig. 1. is handled in the Co ndition monitoring server. 
 
 
Fig.1. Condition Monitoring Flow Diagram 
The data is first extracted  as raw signals, and then 
features are identified and then classification is 
carried out to obtain the desired outcomes using a 
deep learning model. All th e data is then fed into 
the ANN model for the prediction of residual 
useful life.  
3. Methodology of Proposed ANN Model  
3.1. Remaining useful life prediction methods 
Remaining useful Life focuses on condition-based 
maintenance on time and ensures the safety of the equipment. Physics-based method, data-driven method, and hybrid method are used to calculate 
the RUL of equipment according to the nature of 
the complex machine system and the availability of 
data and expertise within the organizations. Bayesian networks (BN) structure and probabilities for each node are used for fault diagnosis of bearing. Other tools which are also used to generate 
are the tree structure fishbone diagrams[13], and 
similar variation sensitivity matrix[14]. The structure of the tree based on data is utilized to optimize the problems [15]. Equipment 
maintenance databases ar e used to produce the 
provisional likelihoods of the network. Data 
sources for BN include QMS, MES, RMS, CMMS, and CMM which are based on the algorithms, and determine the tree structure. The tree topology 
initializes and is completed.  
The original contribution of this method lies in its 
amalgamation of machine learning algorithms to develop a prediction procedure for RUL. Comparing the proposed method to existing 
approaches reveals several differentiating factors. 
Traditional methods for RUL estimation often rely on simplified models or else on rule-based approaches, which may have limitations in capturing complex degradation patterns and 
variations. In this identified gap, the proposed 
ANN model leverages the power of machine 
learning algorithms to overcome these limitations and provides a more data -driven and accurate RUL 
prediction framework. The integration of artificial neural networks enables the method to handle non-
linear relationships and capture subtle degradation 
patterns that may not be captured by conventional approaches.  3.2. Artificial neural network models  
The ANN articulate a relatio nship between the 
inputs, outputs, and their structure constituent is 
known as a neuron. The fundamental element of 
ANN is the artificial neuron, and such a relationship is expressed in Eq. (1) works by 
taking the

and it symbolizes the actual relationship between inputs and outputs. This relationship corresponds 
to a linear input dataset and a non-linear input 
dataset as in Eq. (2). A non-linear activation function is also added to this relationship.

forecast the RUL of bearings. The minimum error value is fed to the netwo rk before new vibrational

RUL. It is considered a benchmark parameter. It 
specifies that once the bearing reaches its 
specified life. it will be fully destroyed. The 
FEMTO dataset has been ex tensively utilized to 
illustrate various methods for condition monitoring and prognostics. 
 
Fig.3. Proposed Reliability ANN Model 
Some research is carried out on rolling element-bearing health condition monitoring, signal processing techniques, and high-frequency resolution of the vibration signals [16]. This 
dataset was also used in some publications to 
study the method of construction of HI from vibration signals[17]. This dataset is used to develop the RUL model[18]. Data analysis is used to train neural networks.  Once an overfit is 
detected, it is discontinued training. The model 
performs well during the training process but 
performs poorly when tested with unknown data. The cross-validation method is used for 
overcoming this issue. F or training and validating 
the network, two distinct sets of data are used. 
During an overfit situation, the validation set's 
mean square error (MSE ) first decreases, till it 
reaches a minimum and then increases. 
Training is discontinued as the validation set 
escalates. The mean square er ror starts increasing 
as a result of the regression algorithm which is 
based on overfitting of data.  There is no specific 
method for the selection of an ANN topology. The evaluation of network topology test and error 
quest scheme occurs in two stages such as, 
divided data is first train ing and it is followed in 
the second stage by validation for instance training holds the actual data set beginning of input, and validatio n within +5% feed of data. 
ANN model is normalized at the output to obtain 
a similar order of magnitude between zero and one (0-1) to avoid the is sues of instability with the 
modeled result. It is necessary to choose the minimum validation error for the prediction of 
RUL. The hidden layers are configured with a 
log-sigmoid transfer function and transfer 
function (linear) at the layer of output. By 
applying this combination network, it is possible 
to easily approximate any of the assigned function, Levenberg Marquardt (trainlm) 
algorithm provide satisfa ctory results in the 
training algorithm. The training algorithm is proposed for curtailing functions which is the square of the sum of the nonlinear function. The second-order convergence approach is performed by not considering the ca lculation of the Hessian 
matrix. The performance function is equal to the 
sum of squares followed by Hessian matrix

ANN model with time an d RMS and kurtosis 
hazard rates as inputs and normalized life percentage of their output. The proposed ANN model is a suitable tool for the prediction of the 
RUL of Bearing.   
3.3. Significance and validation of ANN 
In this paper, the proposed ANN model is 
validated by using the actual and predicted test 
data of bearing to forecast the RUL. The 
prognosis of model RHSA assesses the useful life 
of a bearing, which can enable one to choose an option related to the reduction of downtime 
through early detection. In wind turbines and 
complex machine components, the ANN model 
can minimize downtime and maintenance costs 
due to early accurate prediction of RUL. it is effective for improving RUL prediction accuracy, particularly in noisy en vironments, hence it has 
significant practical application. In the decision making it saves the time, cost of scheduled 
maintenance and minimizes associated risks, and 
leads to ensuring the operation of power generation confidently. 
4. Results  
4.1. Proposed A NN model results  
The Proposed model of ANN has generated 
desired results and it works efficiently under linear and non-linear machine problem situations. In bearing1_1 health vibrational signals are plotted in Fig. 4. The initial signals of the bearing 
are up to 2000 secs, which  predict the health of 
the bearing, and signals above that level it shows 
the failure of the bearing . These signals are useful 
and change the signal intensity up to the peak value. Such sensed sign als reflect the impact force 
or a fault point of the bearing due to wear and tear, which helps to obtain info rmation for the RUL of 
the bearing. 
 
Fig.4. Bearing1_1 vibrational Health signal 
The Temperature signals are assigned as input 
parameters to the ANN model with the vibrational signals for training. The temperature signals are shown in Fig.5. where signals are increasing with respect to time which indicates a direct relationship between vibration and temperature parameters and 
inverse proportionality be tween vibration and 
viscosity. It also reveals that rising temperature may lead to high friction, and consequently, it 
deteriorates the life of the bearing.  Such 
information is supplied to  the Neural Network to 
calculate the degradation process and prediction of the RUL of bearing. 
Fig.5. Temperature Signals for Proposed ANN Model  
The RMS of the bearing  shown in Fig. 6. 
describes the changing s tate of vibrational signals. 
It serves as a significant in dicator regarding health 
conditions and degradation of bearing. The results 
represent the RMS behavior changes with 
subsequent changes in weights and bias with respect to time. Hence, the findings suggest that 
when the time surpasses 2500  seconds, there is a 
noticeable shift in the p attern and intensity of

vibration signals, indicating the onset of bearing 
degradation and imminent risk of failure. 
Fig. 6. RMS of Bearing1_1  
ANN model can learn to  associate certain 
vibration patterns with different stages of bearing health, enabling it to make predictions about the 
remaining useful life of the bearing. Therefore, 
this feature works like an actual scenario to 
forecast the bearing life and fault identification.  
In Fig. 7. Kurtosis values are used to scale the 
data, based on the previous and present state of condition of the bearing. Since Kurtosis is sensitive to impact si gnals, it diagnoses the 
surface damage faults. Howev er, it is fourth-order 
static, so it is very difficu lt to distinguish the fault 
signal from the noise.

Pulse reflecting surface fault characteristic 
extracted from pulse modulation signals mixed 
with noise. kurtosis help s to assess the presence 
of abnormal or extreme values in the vibration signals alongside other relevant features, and 
behavior of vibration signals. 
ANN can learn the relationship between the statistical properties of the vibration signals and 
the health state of the bearing leading to improved prognostic capabilities. 
 
Fig. 8. Result of ANN Model 
Fig. 8. shows a linear relationship that exists 
between predicted RUL and the behavior of 
vibrational signal, which shows the capability, 
efficiency, and effectiv eness of the proposed 
ANN model under the specified condition in the prediction of the remaining useful life of the bearing, as indicated with a blue line across the 
black line. However, it is  important to note that a 
here ANN model is showing the linear 
relationship between the actual and predicted RUL because of lower RSME and MSE error which reflect the better performance of ANN model results near to actu al RUL but this may not 
always be expected or fe asible in all cases. The 
suitability of a linear trend depends on the specific 
degradation pattern. Different degradation 
mechanisms may exhibit different patterns and 
the proposed model can capture non-linear relationships between predicted and actual RUL.  
In brief, the presence of a linear relationship 
between the actual and predicted RUL in Fig. 8.

indicates that the proposed ANN model is 
performing accurately in estimating the remaining 
useful life of the bearing, providing valuable insights for maintenance planning and decision-making. The trained (RUL) refers to the predicted 
remaining lifespan of the bearing based on the 
training data in the developed model. It represents 
the estimated time to reflect the operation of the bearing before reaching failure. The Validation RUL of bearing involves assessing the accuracy and reliability of predictions by comparing the 
predicted RUL values with the actual RUL values 
as acquired from real-time monitoring. The 
estimated life indicates th e predicted residual life 
of the bearing at different time points. It is plotted against the correspondi ng time on the X-axis 
where estimation is based on the trained model's 
analysis of the bearing's health condition, 
depicted through various sensor signals or input features. As a result, th e estimated life of the 
bearing provides insights into the expected longevity that allows one to make decisions regarding proactive maintenance. The ANN 
Model is further applied  to additional training 
datasets, including bearings 1_2, bearing2_1, 
bearing2_2, bearing3_1, and bearing 3_2, along 
with testing bearings, to  evaluate their reliability 
and predict the remaining useful life of bearings. The model demonstrates ro bust performance in 
predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of 
bearings. 
 
Fig. 9. Trained Predicted and Actual Tested Result 
The results obtained from the conducted 
experimental test data were completely analyzed. 
These results were compar ed with the predicted 
values of the remaining useful life (RUL), as 
illustrated in Fig. 9. The X-axis represents the 
samples from the validatio n dataset of the test bearings, while the Y-axis represents the 
corresponding predicted and actual RUL values 
of each tested bearing. Fig. 9. shows the accurate and precise determination of the actual and predicted RUL of the bearings by the ANN model. The validation set of testing data for the 
test bearings illustrated as shown in Table 4.1., 
was utilized to derive and predicted RUL values over time. The comparison in Fig. 9. predicted and actual values further confirm the superior performance of the ANN model in accurately predicting the RUL of the bearings. 
4.2. Result in Compar ison with Other Models  
The proposed model was ev aluated and compared 
with some other machin e learning models (SVR, 
LSTM, DNN model) based on key features such 
as RMSE see Table. 4.1., Score, and RUL. These variables were used to evaluate each model's predictive accuracy, perfor mance, and robustness. 
Similarly, the estimated scor e of models such as 
SVR, LSTM, DNN, and proposed ANN model is 
0.306, 0.429, 0.482, and 0.812, respectively.  The 
comparison provides scientific evidence to support the advantages of the proposed ANN 
model over other machine learning models. The 
lower the RMSE, the lo wer the overall prediction 
error, and high score values represent model 
accuracy.

data, showcasing its resilience and predictive 
capabilities, thereby affirm ing its aptness for the 
given task more than the other models. 
5. Conclusion  
The outcomes of the proposed ANN model 
showcase its better perf ormance in precisely 
predicting the remaining useful life of the bearing. 
The proposed model outperforms better than other machine learning m ethods due to its ability 
to effectively handle large datasets and complex calculations associated with bearings, considering 
both linear and non-linear factors. This capability 
enables the model to provide accurate RUL predictions. The implementation of the proposed model significantly contributes to improving overall bearing efficiency and preventing failures by enabling proactive maintenance in critical 
areas at offshore horizon tal axis wind turbines 
such as other assembly parts and components. Future research endeavor s will focus on further 
advancing RUL prediction methods by incorporating the real-time provision of maintenance strategies, specifically targeting 
high-speed rotating bearing failures across 
diverse operating conditions.
