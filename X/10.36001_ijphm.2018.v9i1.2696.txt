ABSTRACT  
The operation and maintenance costs of offshore wind farms 
can be significantly reduced if existing corrective actions 
are performed as efficient as possible and if future 
corrective actions are avoided by performing sufficient 
preventive actions. In this paper a prognostic model for 
degradation monitoring,  fault prediction  and predictive 
maintenance of offshore wind components is defined.  
The diagnostic model defined in this paper is based on 
degradation, remaining useful lifetime and hybrid inspection 
threshold models. The defined degradation model is based 
on an exponential distribution with stochastic scale factor 
modelled by  a normal distribution. Once based on  failures,  
inspection or condition monitoring data  sufficient 
observations  on the degradation level of a component are  
available, using Bayes’ rule and Normal -Normal model 
prior exponential parameters of the degradation model can 
be updated. The components of the diagnostic model 
defined in this paper are further explained within several 
illustrative examples. At the end, conclusions are given  and 
recommendations for future studies on this topic  are 
discussed . 
1. INTRODUCTION  
The offshore wind energy is the fastest growing power 
sector in Europe , set to have a fivefold increase in installed 
capacity by 2030  (Tardieu et al. 2017) . The offshore wind 
growth can be sustained only if offshore wind  operation and 
maintenance (O&M)  costs are reduced to their minimum , 
allowing utilities to operate profitable  offshore wind farms 
in absence  of government  subsidies  (Asgarpour 2018) . The majority of O&M  costs  of offshore wind farms is  caused by 
unplanned failure of wind farm components  (Asgarpour & 
Sørensen 2015) . The costs of unplanned failures can  be 
reduced significantly if faults of wind fa rm components can 
be predicted, before they occur, or be detected, as soon as 
they occur an d before they lead to a failure . In (Asgarpour 
& Sørensen 2018) , a Bayesian diagnostic model for fault 
detection and condition based maintenance of offshore wind 
farm components is introduced. This paper focuses only on 
fault prediction or prognostic s of offshore wind 
components.  
In (Sikorska & Ma 2011) , a thorough overview on  
knowledge -based, stochastic, Artificial Neural Network 
(ANN) and physical  prognostic models applicable for 
Remaining Useful Lifetime (RUL) prediction of engineering 
assets is given.  The aut hors in (Sikorska & Ma 2011)  have 
concluded that mathematically or computing complexity 
limits current use of many prognostic approaches to industry 
practitioners. In (Novaes et al. 2018)  and (Kandukuri et al. 
2016) , available prognostic models for gearbox, main 
bearing and b lades of wind turbines are reviewed. Authors 
in (Novaes et al. 2018)  have concluded that in contrary to 
diagnostics, very little attention has been given to the 
application of prognostic techniques in wind turbines. In 
(Lau et al. 2012) , Hidden Markov Model (HMM), ANN and 
Particle Filter (PF) techniques for prognostic of offsh ore 
wind turbines are reviewed. Furthermore, in (Nielsen & 
Sørensen 2017) , (Rasekhi Nejad et al. 2014)  and (Griffith et 
al. 2014)  case studies for prognostic of wind turbine blades, 
gears and bearings are given.  
This paper demonstrates a n applied  and computationally 
inexpensive  solution for prognostic and predictive 
maintenance of offshore wind components. In the 
following s, first degradation and remaining useful lifetime 
models are briefly discussed and then, within several 
illustrative examples a prognostic model for predictive 
maintenance of offshore wind components is outlined.  _____________________

2 2. DEGRADATION MODELLING  
Instead of probability  of a failure, reliability of a component 
can be expressed by its degradation. According to EN 
13306:2010 (Technical Committee CEN 319 2010) , 
degradation is “ detrimental change in physical  condition, 
with time, use or external cause ”. Reliability of a 
component can be degradation based if the degradation of 
the component is gradual, observable and measurable.  
In (Welte & Wang 2014) , an overview of applicable models 
for degradation modeling of wind turbine components is 
given. The degradation level of a component can be 
estimated  based on a physical  or data-driven  degradation 
model. Relevant physical models for degradation modeling 
of wind farm components are Paris’ law for crack growth 
development (applied typically for degradation modelling of 
welded details in steel towers and monopiles, and in wind 
turbine blades) and S -N curves and the Palmgren -Miner’s 
rule for fatigue assessment (applied typically for 
degradation modelling of foundations or dri vetrain 
mechanical components).  
Data -driven models for degradation modeling are statistical 
or Artificial Intelligence (AI) models based on continuous 
condition monitoring  or inspection  data. In (Schwabacher & 
Goebel 2007) , a survey on AI models for prognostics is 
given. In contrary to AI models, statistical models are 
computationally inexpensive and are applicable to a w ider 
range of component types and failure modes. In (Si et al. 
2011) , a comprehensive overview on statistical data -driven 
techniques for lifetime  estimation of engineering assets is 
given.   
Among statistical prognostic methods, exponential model is 
one of the most popular methods  used (Li et al. 2015) . In 
this paper,  degradation of a component is assumed to be 
modelled using an exponential model:  
𝐷(𝑡)=𝛽(𝜇,𝜎)×𝑒𝛼𝑡 (1) 
The initial deterministic shape  factor  and normal distributed 
scale factor  of an exponential degradation model should be 
first estimated. Once enough observations from degradation 
level  or failures  of a component are available, the initial 
shape and scale parameters can be updated.  
2.1. Initial degradation model  
In absence of suffici ent operational data at the beginning of 
a wind farm lifetime, the initial values of shape and scale 
factors of an exponential degradation model  of a repairable 
component  can be estimated bas ed on its average failure 
rate, which can be translated back into  its mean time 
between failures  (1𝜆⁄=𝑀𝑇𝐵𝐹). Then, a  component failure 
can be expressed  by its maximum degradation  𝐷(𝑡)=1 
once its lifetime reaches  𝑡≈1𝜆⁄=𝑀𝑇𝐵𝐹 : 𝐷(𝑡≈1𝜆⁄=𝑀𝑇𝐵𝐹)=1   𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛   →     
𝐷(1𝜆⁄)=𝛽(𝜇,𝜎)𝑒𝛼
𝜆=1   𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛   →     
𝛽(𝜇,𝜎)≈𝜇𝛽=1
𝑒𝛼
𝜆⁄ (2) 
Now that relation between shape and mean of the scale 
factor is known, it is sufficient to assume one of them. 
Based on the previous experience or experts’ judgment, the 
shape factor of a component can be chosen. For instance, in 
Figure 1 , the init ial exponential degradation model for a 
component with an average failure rate per year equal to 
0.05 based on three different shape factor assumptions is 
shown.  
 
Figure 1. Initial degradation model of a component based on 
differe nt shape factors assuming 0.05 as its failure rate  per 
year 
In Figure 1 it can be seen that a smaller shape factor (e.g. 
0.3) results into more gradual degradation curve . On the 
contrary, a higher shape factor (e.g. 0.9) results into a less 
gradual degradation curve with sudden failure.  
For instance, if based on the previous experience or experts’ 
judgment , the shape factor of 0.7 be assumed for 
degradation model of the component  shown in Figure 1 , 
then according to Equation (2) the mean initial scale factor 
of this  component can be calculated as 8.315𝐸−07. 
The initial scale factor of an exponential degradation model 
can be assumed deterministic or if possible, based on the 
previous experience  or expert’s judgement , its standard 
deviation  can be assumed. For instance, if t he standard 
deviation of the scale factor be assumed as  5% of its mean , 
then the  normal distributed  scale factor can be defined as 
𝛽(8.315𝐸−07,4.157𝐸−08). Now that both initial shape 
and scale factors are known, the initial or prior degrada tion 
model  based on Equation (1)  can be formulated as  
𝐷(𝑡)=𝛽(8.315𝐸−07,4.157𝐸−08) ×𝑒0.7𝑡. 
In Figure 2 the degradation model of the aforementioned 
component b ased on 1%, 50% and 99% quantiles of its 
stochastic normal distributed scale factor is visualized.

Figure 2. Initial degradation model of a component based on 
different scale factor quantiles assuming 0.7 as its shape 
factor  
As s hown in Figure 2, for a fixed assumed shape factor, 
smaller scale factors lead to slightly longer lifetime and 
higher scale factors lead to slightly shorter lifetime.  
The uncertainty introduced by assuming the  shape factor 
and standard deviation of the sc ale factor can be 
significantly reduced one sufficient  observations for 
updating the initial model are available. The updating of 
initial shape and scale factors are discussed in the following 
section.  
2.2. Updating the degradation model  
The initial or prior degradation model of a component can 
be updated once observations on the degradation level of the 
component are available or once the component 
unexpectedly fails.  The observations on the degradation 
level of a component can be based o n inspection or 
condition monitoring data.  Estimation of the degradation 
level of a component based on real -time condition 
monitoring data (such as vibration, temperature and oil 
particle data) is not further discussed here.  In (Gebraeel et 
al. 2005) , Bayesian updating of stochastic parameters of 
exponential degradation models  based on real -time 
condition monitoring data  is discussed  in deta il.  
The de gradation level of a component based on  inspection s 
can be determined using a Degradation Matrix. A 
degradation matrix is a catalogue for technicians to translate 
their observations during inspection of a component into 
discrete degradation leve ls of that component. If observed 
degradation of a component is known, then the mean 
observed scale factor of its exponential degradation model 
can be formulated as:  
𝛽(𝜇,𝜎)≈𝜇𝛽=𝐷𝑒𝛼⁄  𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛  →     
𝜇𝛽,𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑=𝐷𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑𝑒𝛼⁄ (3) 
 In Table 1 an example of such a degradation matrix for wind 
turbine main bearing s and monopile s is given.  
Component  Observed Damage  Estimated 
Degradation  
Bearing    
 No damage  0 - 0.2 
 Micro pitting  0.2 - 0.4 
 Debris damage  0.4 - 0.6 
 Edge loading  0.6 - 0.8 
 Cage damage  0.8 - 1.0 
Monopile    
 No damage  0 - 0.2 
 Coating damage  0.2 - 0.4 
 Scour protection damage  0.4 - 0.6 
 Substantial corrosion  0.6 - 0.8 
 Substantial cracks  0.8 - 1.0 
Table 1. Example of degradation matrix for inspection wind 
turbine of bearings  and monopiles  
For instance, if a technician observes minor coating damage 
on an offshore wind monopile,  using the degradation matrix 
given in Table 1 she can translate it into degradation level of 
0.25. Then, based on Equation (3)  and assuming 0.7 as the 
shape factor, the associated mean scale fact or to this 
degradation level is 0.124.  
In order to take into account the  uncertainty of  inspection or 
condition monitoring based observations , a hybrid of  
observations from different sour ces can be used . Then, the 
scale factors estimated based on these inspections can be 
fitted to a normal distribution and consequently, observed 
mean and standard deviation of the  observed  scale factor 
can be determined. For instance, besides the inspection  
results , the degradation level of the same monopile  based on 
the accumulated fatigue calculated from structural health 
monitoring data can be  estimated . Then, the observed scale 
factor can be used to updated the prior one estimated in 
section 2.1. 
2.2.1.  Updating of scale factor  
As discussed above, once by inspections  and/or condition 
monitoring data  the degradation level and associated 
observed scale fa ctor of a componen t is known, the 
posterior scale factor of that component’s degradation 
model can be calculated. The posterior distribution of a 
normal distribution is also a normal distribution. According 
to the Bayes’ rule and Normal -Normal model (Jacobs 2008), 
the param eters of the posterior distribution of a prior normal 
distribution given an obs ervation can be calculated using 
Equations (4) and (5 ):

Accordin g to Equation (4 ), the posterior precision of a 
normal distribution is equal to the summation of its prior 
and observed precisions (1
𝜎2⁄). Furthermore , according to 
Equation (5 ), the posterior mean of a normal distribution is 
equal to the summation of its wei ghted prior and observed 
means. For  instance, if based on several observations  the 
degradation scale factor of the component shown in Figure 2 
is observed as a no rmal distribution with 𝜇𝑂𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑=
1.2𝐸−6 and 𝜎𝑂𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑=1.2𝐸−7, then according to 
Equations (4) and (5 ) the posterior degradation scale factor 
of this component can be formulated as 𝛽(8.71𝐸−
7,3.928𝐸−8).  
In Figure 3, the prior, observ ed and posterior normal 
distributed scale factors of the degradation model are 
visualized.  
 
Figure 3. Posterior scale factor of a component plotted 
against prior and observed scale factors  
Similarly in Figure 4, the prior, observed and posterior 
degradation of this component based on its Bayesian 
updated scale factor is visualized.   
Figure 4. Posterior degradation of a component based on its 
updated scale factor  
It should be not ed that in Figure 4, only 50% quantile of the 
degradation graphs is visualized.  
2.2.2.  Updating of shape factor  
The shape factor of an exponential degradation model can 
also be updated once an unexpected failure (not expected by 
its degradation curve) is occurred . If a failure occurs  at time 
t, then the updated shape factor can be calculated as:  
𝐷(𝑡)=𝛽(𝜇,𝜎)𝑒𝛼𝑡=1   𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛   →    𝛼=−ln𝜇𝛽
𝑡 (6) 
For instance, if it is observed that the component shown 
Figure 2 with shape factor of 0.7 has failed unexpectedly at 
year 18, then  according to Equation (6)  the updated 
degradation shape factor of this component is 0.78.  
Similar to updating method of scale f actor, the shape factor 
can also be updated within a Bayesian model. In that case, 
the shape factor should be modelled as a stochastic variable, 
perhaps fitted to a Weibull distribution. Then, the prior 
shape factor can be updated based on observed failure s to 
determine the posterior shape factor. This method is not 
further discussed in this paper. Since both updated shaped 
and scale factors are known, the updated or posterior 
degradation model for this  component can be formulated as  
𝐷(𝑡)=𝛽(8.71𝐸−7,3.928𝐸−8) ×𝑒0.78𝑡.  
In Figure 5, the 50% quantile posterior degradation of this 
component based on its updated shape and scale factors is 
shown.

Figure 5. Posterior degradation of a component based on its 
updated scale and shape factors  
Now that degradation modelling of a wind farm component 
is known, the remaining useful lifetime of a component at 
any given time can be calculated.  
3. RUL  MODELLING  
Once the degradation of a component reaches its maximum, 
that component can be conside red as failed. Based on this 
statement, the Remaining Useful Lifetime (RUL) of such a 
component at a given time t can be calculated as:  
𝑅𝑈𝐿(𝑡)=(−ln𝛽(𝜇,𝜎)𝛼⁄)−𝑡 (7) 
The RUL estimation  of a component is of interest especially 
when the degradation level  of that component is verified by 
observations. As an example , the 50% quantile of the 
remaining useful lifetime of a component with the posterior 
degradation shown in Figure 5 at year 15 using Equation (7) 
can be calculated as 2.94 years.  
According to thi s remaining useful lifetime estimation, this 
component can operate for another 2.94 years before its 
failure. This value calculated for 50% quantile is the mean 
of RUL at year 15. In order to determine the uncertainty 
associated with this RUL  prediction at 15 years of lifetime, 
the RUL(15) for all quantiles should be calculated.  
For instance, in Figure 6 the RUL of this component at year 
15 based on all quantiles is visualized.   
Figure 6. Uncertainty in RUL prediction at year 15 for the 
component shown in Figure 5  
 
In Figure 6, it can be seen that the RUL predication at year 
15 deviates from approximately 2.8 years to 3.1 years. This 
uncertainty can be translated into standard deviation of 
0.056 years. Similarly, in Figure 7 , five quantiles of the 
remaini ng useful lifetime of this component plotted against 
its lifetime and degradation level are shown.  
 
Figure 7. Remaining useful lifetime of a component plotted 
against its lifetime and degradation level  
From Figure 7 the variation between different remaining 
useful lifetime quantiles for a given time is not very visible 
since the standard deviation of the R UL for this example  
(about 0.05 year) is too small for yearly scale of this graph.  
4. PROGNOSTIC MODEL  
Now  that both degradation and RUL models for offshore 
wind components are known, a prognostic model for fault 
prediction, degradation monitoring and predictive 
maintenance of offshore wind componen ts can be 
developed. In Figure 8 , a framework of a prognostic model 
with Bayesian updating for offshore wind farms is outlined.

Figure 8. Framework of a prognostic model with Bayesian 
updating for offshore wind farms  
The degradation and RUL models required for this 
prognostic framework are already discussed in the previous 
sections of this paper.  
As seen in Figure 8 , once degradation and RUL models of 
offshore wind components are established, inspectio n 
thresholds should be defined to initiate inspections for 
validation of the predicted deg radation of components.  If 
based on an inspection it is p roven that the predicted 
degradation level is correct, then a predictive maintenance 
work order should be created to reduce the degradation of 
the component or to avoid its future faults. On the other 
hand, if based on an inspection it is proven that predicted 
degradation level of the component is not correct, then the 
observed degradation level should be used to update the 
initial or prior degradation and RUL models, as discussed in 
section 2.2 of this paper.  
Validation of the predicted degradation level can be done 
based on the degradation matrix shown in Table 1 . For 
instance, the predicted degradation level of a component is 
considered proven only if it is within 10% o f the observed 
degradation, determined  by using the degradation matrix 
within an inspection.  
The inspection thresholds can be defined based on a 
degradation limit, based on a RUL limit, or based on a 
hybrid of these two. The inspection thresholds should be  
defined in a way to minimize the number of false 
predictions and to comply with defined O&M cost s or wind 
farm availability targets.  4.1. Degradation based threshold  
The degradation based inspection thresholds are triggered 
once the predicated degradation leve l of a component goes 
over a limit, such as 0.7 of the 50% quantile degradation 
curve. If a prognostic model opts for  a degradation based 
threshold , then an inspection should be done once a 
component lifetime reaches:  
𝐷(𝑡)=𝛽(𝜇,𝜎)𝑒𝛼𝑡   𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛   →    𝑡=ln(𝐷(𝑡)/𝛽(𝜇,𝜎))
𝛼 (8) 
For instance, if a prognostic model for the component 
shown in Figure 5 opts for 70% of the degradation at 50% 
quantile as the inspection threshold, then according to 
Equation (8) an inspection for this component should be 
created once its lifetime reaches 17.6 years.  
If the inspection outcome proves that the predicted 
degradation is correct, then a predictive work order should 
be created. At this time,  according to Equation (7)  the 
remaining useful lifetime of this component is only 0.29 
year or three and half months . 
As discussed earlier in section 3 of this paper, the 
uncertainty or standar d deviation of these estimations can be 
determined by calculating these values for all quantiles.  
It is possible that three and half months is not enough time 
to execute this predictive work order, while keeping work 
order execution co sts to its minimum, especially if it is in 
winter season  when long waiting times due to harsh 
offshore weather condition is expected . In order to avoid 
this situation, a prognostic model can opt for a RUL based 
inspection threshold.  
4.2. RUL based threshold  
The RUL based inspectio n thresholds are triggered once the 
predicated RUL of a component goes below a limit, such as 
0.5 year of the 50% quantile RUL curve. If a prognostic 
model opts for a RUL based threshold, then an inspection 
should be done once a component RUL reaches:  
𝑡=(−ln𝛽(𝜇,𝜎)𝛼⁄)−𝑅𝑈𝐿(𝑡) (9) 
or once the degradation of the component becomes:  
𝐷(𝑡)= 
(𝛽(𝜇,𝜎)𝑒𝛼𝑡|𝑡=(−ln𝛽(𝜇,𝜎)𝛼⁄)−𝑅𝑈𝐿(𝑡)) (10) 
For instance, if a prognostic model for the component 
shown in Figure 5 opts for half a year or six months RUL 
(at 50% quantile) as the inspection threshold, then  according 
to Equations (9) and (10),  a predictive work order for this 
component should be create d once its lifetime reaches 17.39 
years or on ce its degradation becomes 0.68.  

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT  
7 Similarly, a s discussed earlier in section 3 of this paper, the 
uncertainty or standar d deviation of these estimations can be 
determined by calculating these values for all quantiles.  
If an inspection threshold is RUL based, then it can be 
ensured that sufficient time for preparation and execution of 
follow up predictive work orders is ava ilable. However, 
RUL based thresholds do not directly consider the 
degradation level of a component, which can result into 
non-repairable damage to some components.  
4.3. Hybrid threshold  
The optimal  inspection threshold for wind farm components 
is a hybrid of d egradation and RUL based thresholds to 
ensure that always sufficient time is available for cost -
effective predictive maintenance of components and at the 
same time, the damage of the component is not very sever e 
and still it can be easily repaired without bearing much 
costs.  
For instance, a hybrid inspection threshold for a component 
can be 70% of degradation and 6 months RUL both at 50% 
quantiles, whi chever occurs first. In Figure 9 , this hybrid of 
degradation and RUL based thresholds for prognostic of th e 
component with posterior deg radation curve given in Figure 
5 is visualized in red and green dotted lines.  
 
Figure 9. Hybrid degradation and RUL based inspection 
thresholds for prognost ic of offshore wind components  
The hybrid inspection thresholds can be updated once based 
on the inspection results they proven to be insufficient.  
5. CONCLUSIONS  
The prognostic model defined in this paper is based on 
degradation and remaining useful lifetime of wind farm 
components. The degradation model defined here is based 
on an exponential model, which initial values of its 
deterministic shape factor and normal distributed stochastic 
scale factor can be determined by using the average failure 
rate of a component. Once sufficient inspection or con dition 
monitoring based  observation s on the degradation  level  of a 
component is known or once a component unexpectedly fails, the initial shape and scale factors can be updated to 
determine t he posterior degradation model.  The 
uncertainties associated with  assumed initial exponential 
parameters of the degradation model can be significantly 
reduced once sufficient observations for Bayesian updating 
of the model are available. The more this prognostic model 
is used in practice, the less the associated uncerta inties are.  
In future studies on this subject, the exponential degradation 
model in this diagnostic model can be replaced by a 
physical or AI degradation model to increase the model 
accuracy. Relevant physical models for degradation 
modeling of wind farm c omponents are Paris’ law for crack 
growth development (applied typically for degradation 
modelling of welded details in steel towers and monopiles, 
and in wind turbine blades) and S -N curves and the 
Palmgren -Miner’s rule for fatigue assessment (applied 
typically for degradation modelling of foundations or 
drivetrain mechanical components). Additionally, similar to 
Bayesian updating of the degradations scale factor, the 
degradation shape factor can be modelled as a Weibull 
distribution and be updated once so me component failures 
are observed.  
In the prognostic model defined in this paper a hybrid of 
degradation and remaining useful lifetime inspection 
thresholds can be used to initiate an inspection for validation 
of the model results. Once an inspection is triggered , if 
using a defined degradation matrix,  it is proven that the 
predicted degradation is not correct, based on the observed 
degradation during the inspection the scale parameters of 
the exponential degradation model can be updated. 
However, if by a n inspection it is proven that the predicted 
degradation of a component is indeed correct, then a 
predictive based work order is created to reduce the 
component degradation or to avoid its future faults.  
Instead of using one set of thresholds followed by o ne 
predictive maintenance strategy, the application of multiple 
thresholds followed by several  different  preventive 
maintenance strategies based on different quantiles 
(uncertainty levels) of degradation and/or remaining useful 
lifetime curves can be inves tigated. Furthermore, within a 
Bayesian decision network, all possible  unknown random  
outcomes of all possible future inspections can be modelled 
and then, optimal O&M strategy based on given cost or 
availability targets at any given time stamp can be 
estimated . In (Sørensen 2009)  a framework for such a 
Bayesian decision model is defined and in (Nielsen 2013)  
and (Nielsen & Sørensen 2014)  several case studies for risk 
based Bayesian decision models are presented.
