Abstract: A condition-based maintenance policy for o shore wind turbines is presented in
consideration of the maintenance uncertainty and the weather e ect. In this paper, the o shore
wind turbine is divided into four main assemblies‚Äînamely, the rotor, gearbox, generator, and pitch
system. The support vector machine classiÔ¨Åcation technique is implemented to analyze the failure
information, which was collected from Ô¨Åeld data in China. According to the results of fault diagnosis
and prediction, the assembly that reaches the corresponding maintenance threshold will be repaired.
At the same time, a maintenance opportunity occurs for the rest of the components, and an optimized
plan can be determined by arranging the maintenance combination and time. The calculated results
indicate that the proposed condition-based maintenance policy is beneÔ¨Åcial to reduce the maintenance
expenditure of o shore wind turbines.

1. Introduction
With the characteristics of stable wind energy resources, large power generation, and easy
consumption, o shore wind energy has developed rapidly in recent years and has a broad market
prospect [ 1,2]. Oshore wind energy has signiÔ¨Åcant advantages compared with onshore. (1) Energy
reserves are more than three times those of onshore wind. (2) Average available hours of o shore
wind power are more than 3000 h per year, which is higher than the 2000 h of onshore wind power [ 3].
This happens because the o shore wind is more stable and the average wind speed is higher, which
can meet the minimum wind speed requirements for longer time than onshore wind power. (3) The
oshore wind turbine (OWT) has little impact on human life and is close to the coastal electricity
concentration area, which is convenient for the supply of wind energy.
Despite the great potential of o shore wind power, its high risk of failure and serious consequences
of failure pose challenges to safe and e cient energy development [ 4,5]. As an important wind energy
collection and conversion equipment, OWTs are in a harsh climate, and the waves, tides, and other
factors are complex and variable, resulting in the risk of failure changing with the increase of running
time [ 6,7]. The design life of OWT is 20 years, and its cost of the operation and maintenance (O&M)
occupy approximately 25‚Äì30% of the 75‚Äì90% of the investment costs or whole energy generation

cost [ 8,9]. It can be explained by the following: (1) insu cient accessibility due to the unpredictable
weather and the remote location; (2) compared with onshore ones, more failures owing to the oceanic
environment, for example, storm surge, sea wave, sea ice; (3) extra inventory expense, speciÔ¨Åc vessels,
and technicians are needed.
Risk control measures should analyze the inÔ¨Çuences of various factors such as safety, economy,
and cost [ 10]. Under the traditional periodic maintenance and time-based maintenance methods,
if the system conditions are acceptable when performing preventive maintenance work, it will cause
a waste of the remaining life of the system, and if the system deteriorates faster than expected,
a failure may occur. Recently, researches related to data-based wind turbines condition monitoring are
proposed. Pandit et al. [ 11] presented a reference power curve using Supervisory Control And Data
Acquisition (SCADA) datasets from a healthy turbine, which is developed by using a Gaussian Process
and then was compared with a power curve from an unhealthy turbine. Yang et al. [ 12] studied a
new condition monitoring method with the help of the concept of the transmissibility of Frequency
Response Functions. Experiment of veriÔ¨Åcation showed that the new technique is e ective not only in
damage detection but in damage location in certain conditions. With the continuous maturity of state
monitoring, storage and analysis technologies, condition-based maintenance (CBM) is a solution of
this problem and has become a hot issue in the Ô¨Åeld of risk control [13,14]. The CBM method focuses
on the speciÔ¨Åc operating conditions of the system, evaluates the true state of the monitored equipment,
overcomes the blindness of maintenance, and can e ectively reduce accidental failures caused by
insucient maintenance and waste of resources due to over-maintenance. Simulation methods are
usually used in studying the e ect of CBM in any type of system [ 15]. Scheu et al. [ 16] presented a
transparent risk-based methodology for the prioritization of OWT systems toward the application of
condition monitoring systems. Calculated results contained information related to various kinds of
wind turbines and substructure concepts. This work shows details of paths that leads to critical failure
modes, which is the basis of designing a condition monitoring system. ShaÔ¨Åee et al. [17] proposed a
CBM optimization model for a multi-blade fan system. The calculation results show that the CBM
method can e ectively reduce the maintenance cost. Ghamlouch et al. [ 18] proposed a method of
condition-based maintenance strategy mainly adopting option theory, which solved the maintenance
interval optimization problem of complex systems considering the uncertainty of production and
deterioration. Verbert et al. [ 19] analyzed the multi-component problem of the research object and
proposed a new CBM optimization method. Based on the analysis of economic correlation and
structural correlation between components, the rational planning of maintenance tasks can be made to
achieve system-level maintenance program optimization.
In terms of multi-component systems such as OWTs, whenever a component of the OWT system
needs to be repaired, other components will be given the opportunity to repair in advance and form a
certain number of group maintenance plans [ 20]. Opportunistic maintenance, often abbreviated as OM,
has superiority in the following aspects: (1) it is critical for OWTs that joint maintenance processes only
spend one portion of the Ô¨Åxed cost; (2) vessels, technicians, and tools are all maintenance resources
that can also be in common use. Whereas, the preventative maintenance (usually abbreviated as
PM) should not be conducted when the previous maintenance date results in the loss of assemblies.
Regarding Remaining Useful Life (RUL), by comparing the maintenance costs corresponding to
dierent grouping schemes, the best repair solution could be determined. Song et al. [ 21] introduced a
two-stage framework to optimize the operation of o shore wind farms. Computational models were
developed for opportunistic condition-based maintenance. Minimum maintenance costs are calculated
and used to determine the schedule of periodic inspections. Pandit et al. [ 22] presented a support vector
regression-based pitch curve, which was adopted in anomaly detection exploration. The comparative
results in consideration of a binned pitch curve showed that the blade pitch curve closely follows
the binned pitch curve, but above the rated wind speed. Zhou and Yin [ 23] formulated a dynamic
opportunistic condition-based maintenance strategy. The varying maintenance lead-time e ect on the
maintenance decision was analyzed, which remarkably a ects the maintenance cost. The comparative
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

analysis illustrated the capability of the proposed strategy. Lu et al. [ 24] proposed a CBM optimization
method for OWT systems in consideration of opportunities. An artiÔ¨Åcial neural network (ANN)
was employed to analyze the RUL based on the system monitoring data. A comparative study was
performed, and the feasibility of the presented approach was proved.
The objective of this paper is to achieve an optimized economy and availability by an opportunistic
maintenance policy. First, we calculate the preventive repair threshold and the opportunity maintenance
threshold from the parameters such as the lost shutdown loss, maintenance cost, and failure probability
of the component. By comparing the support vector machine (SVM) fault prediction results with the
maintenance thresholds, the components that need to be repaired at that time are identiÔ¨Åed, and Ô¨Ånally
the maintenance operation optimization scheme in the entire calculation interval is formed. The core
idea of this method is to obtain the optimal repair time and maintenance combination by analyzing the
correlation between components, so as to reduce the number of repairs and reduce the repair cost.
The following sections of the paper are organized as this: Section 2 presents the OWT system
description. The fault diagnosis model based on SVM is introduced in Section 3. A case study is
performed in Section 4, including the discussion of the results. Conclusions are addressed in the
last section.
2. System Description of a Generic O shore Wind T urbine
The basic function of the OWT is to use the rotor blade system to absorb wind energy and convert
it into mechanical energy; then, transfer the mechanical energy to the generator system through the
transmission system; then, convert it into electric energy by the generator; and Ô¨Ånally, output the
electric energy through the grid to complete the whole process. In the entire process of converting to
electricity, OWTs can be divided into a certain amount of assemblies according to various functions.
In this paper, the OWTs system [ 25] is divided into four main assemblies according to the various
functions (Figure 1), which are the more relevant ones from a failure rate point of view [26].
A rotor can be divided into three components, including rotor blades, rotor bearings, and a rotor
hub. A rotor system functions to absorb and transmit the wind energy. A generator is installed inside
the nacelle. This equipment is used to convert mechanical energy to electrical energy and adapt the
output energy from the wind turbine to the grid. The gearbox functions to transform high-torque to
low-torque and transform the low speed of the main shaft to the high speed of the generator. A pitch
system is a mechanism that turns the blade, or part of the blade, in order to adjust the angle of attack of
the wind.

3. Support Vector Machine Classification Algor ithm  
Fault analysis based on big data is the frontier method for  the risk identification of offshore wind 
turbines. Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers is an effective data processing technology , which is 
based on the structural risk minimi zation prin ciple solving a quadratic programming problem [28]. By 
applying the kernel function , the method can map the data into a higher dimensional input space and 
construct an optimal hyperplane. In this study, ‚Äú ŒΩ‚Äù-Soft Margin Support Vector Classifiers (SVC), a c lass 
of ŒΩ-SVM, is applied, which can predetermine the fraction of training sample that are  support vectors [29]. 
Given a training dataset as , the goal is to find a 
function  to construct the classifier, taking the form

which is a hyperparameter that need s to be determined. Data points that are closer to the hyperplane 
and affect the position and orientation of the hyperplane are called support vectors (as shown in 
Figure 2) . In the -SVC algorithm, the hyperparameter  is replaced by the formulation of 
constant  to control the number of margin errors and the support vectors. The optimization

Carroll et al. [ 27] addressed three parameters of o shore wind turbines including maintenance
cost, repair time, and failure rate. The results indicate that the pitch system and generator are the largest
contributors to failure rates, and the gearbox has the highest average cost per failure. The downtime
of the gearbox and rotor are the longest, which can be explained by the high installation position
and weight.
3. Support Vector Machine ClassiÔ¨Åcation Algorithm
Fault analysis based on big data is the frontier method for the risk identiÔ¨Åcation of o shore wind
turbines. Support vector machine (SVM) classiÔ¨Åers is an e ective data processing technology, which is
based on the structural risk minimization principle solving a quadratic programming problem [ 28].
By applying the kernel function, the method can map the data into a higher dimensional input space
and construct an optimal hyperplane. In this study, ‚Äú ‚Äù-Soft Margin Support Vector ClassiÔ¨Åers (SVC),
a class of -SVM, is applied, which can predetermine the fraction of training sample that are support
vectors [29].
Given a training dataset as(x1,y1),:::,(xi,yi),:::,(xN,yN)	,xk2Rn,yk2R, the goal is to Ô¨Ånd a
function f(x)to construct the classiÔ¨Åer, taking the form
f(x) =sign(wT'(x) +b) (1)
where wis the weight vector; ()is the nonlinear function; and bis the bias term. For the original
Support Vector ClassiÔ¨Åer (SVC) algorithm, the optimization process can be described as follows
min

yi((xiw) +b)1 i,i0 (3)
The regularization constant Cdetermines the trade-o of a large margin and noise tolerance,
which is a hyperparameter that needs to be determined. Data points that are closer to the hyperplane
and a ect the position and orientation of the hyperplane are called support vectors (as shown in
Figure 2). In the -SVC algorithm, the hyperparameter Cis replaced by the formulation of constant 
to control the number of margin errors and the support vectors. The optimization problem becomes

Note that Cdoes not appear in the objective function. Instead, a parameter and an additional
variableare added to be optimized. The new hyperparameter is an upper bound on the fraction
of margin errors and a lower bound on the fraction of Support Vectors (SV) [ 29]. To derive the dual,
the Lagrangian can be constructed as
L(w,,b,,,,)

wherei,i,0are Lagrange multipliers. The optimal solution is given by the saddle point of the
Lagrangian. Thereby, the conditions are

In the above equations, the dot product of (x)is substituted by kernel functions. In this study,
the Gaussian kernel is used to map the data into a higher dimensional input space, meanwhile avoiding
the dimensionality curse

Only the training data belonging to the Support Vectors will a ect the classiÔ¨Åer, and the number

hyperparameters andis signiÔ¨Åcant to avoid overÔ¨Åtting. They can be selected by the cross-validation
procedure, Ô¨Ånding the support vector classiÔ¨Åers with a good performance on data not yet observed.

to describe the condition of each unit, which means that the components are either in a functional or
failure state.
4.1. Reliability Threshold Calculation
According to the Opportunistic CBM strategy, the maintenance decision for each component can
be concluded.
The probability density f(t)can be described by
f(t) =d
dtF(t) =d
dt(1 R(t)) = R0(t) (12)
where R(t)is the corresponding survivor function. The failure rate (t)can be derived as
(t) =f(t)
R(t)= R0(t)
R(t)= d
dtlnR(t) (13)
Since R(0)=1, thenZDti,j
0i,j(t)dt= lnRi,j(t) (14)
whereRDti,j
0i,j(t)dtexpresses the cumulative failure risk of component iin maintenance cycle j,
implying that the number of corrective maintenance (CM) for component iin each maintenance cycle
is equal to lnRi,j(t), which is considered as the PM threshold.
Since the number of CM during Dti,jis lnRi,j(t), assuming that the maintenance times for
component iduring the operation period is Mi, the mean maintenance cost per unit time of this
component is deÔ¨Åned as follows
ECi=Mi[C0+ (CCM(i)+CD(i)(Wt+0i,j))( lnRi,j(t)) + C0PM(i)+CD(i)i,j]
NiP
j=1(Dti,j+Wt+i,j)(15)
wherei,jis the PM duration and ‚Äôi,jis the CM duration. i,jconsists of the repair time and travel
time, and‚Äôi,jis usually longer than i,jbecause CM requires extra logistic time, resulting in more
downtime losses. The inÔ¨Çuence of changeable marine environment is considered in the presented
model. In Equation (15), Wtis the waiting time for an appropriate sea condition, which satisÔ¨Åed the
requirement of o shore operation. CCM(i) is the CM cost, including the recovery expense and the
downtime losses. C0PM(i) and CD(i)represent the imperfect PM expense and unit downtime losses,
respectively. C0PM(i) is related to age reduction factor i,jand PM cost CPM(i) , which can be evaluated as
C0
PM(i)=
1 i,j2CPM(i)(16)
The individual optimal Ri,j(t) can be obtained by minimizing ECi. Obtaining threshold Ri,j(t) is
the basis of the presented approach.

4.2. The Calculation of Assemblies‚Äô Remaining Life
In this paper, the SVM method proposed in Section 3 is implemented to address the collected
OWT monitoring information. A dataset with 80% of the historical data is used as incentive data to
complete the training of the model. The remaining 20% of the historical data are used as veriÔ¨Åcation
data to prove the accuracy of the model prediction. In practice, temperature and vibration are closely
related to system failure. Therefore, this research selects these two feature quantities as the regressors.
The trained SVM model is employed to identify the real-time status of the components. If the threshold
Ri,j(t) is reached, a PM activity should be performed.
In the modeling process, ‚Äúkernel trick‚Äù is used to approximate the upper bound of the generalization
error by minimizing the norm of the weights in the feature space. The Gaussian kernel function is used
to determine the nonlinear mapping of regressors. Compared to the polynomial kernels, the Gaussian
kernel has less numerical di culty, and only one hyperparameter needs to be determined, which is
easier to choose. In this way, the model structure is chosen with a trade-o between empirical errors in
training data and model complexity. By using the kernel dot product trick, the curse of dimensionality,
which usually happens in other black-box modeling methods such as ANN, can be avoided, and a
unique global solution can be solved through a convex optimization problem.
4.3. Determination of the Maintenance Group
For an OWT system, when units kandiare jointly repaired, the corresponding cost preservation
can be evaluated as
CS(i,k,j)=C0+CD(i,k,j)+CM(i,k,j) CP(i,k,j) (17)
where CD(i,k,j)is the downtime cost preservation resulting from the joint maintenance, which can be
deÔ¨Åned as
CD(i,k,j)=Cd(i)i,k2min (18)
When the component iis recovered in advance, the unexpected failures would be reduced. The
cost saving for the decline of random malfunctions is CM(i,k,j), which can be expressed as
CM(i,k,j)= [( lnRi,j(t)) ( lnRi,k(t))]CCM(i) (19)
After one PM activity is performed in advance, every planned maintenance time should be
rearranged. Assuming ti,jrepresents the previous maintenance time and t0i,jrepresents the latest one,
the overall time switch should be
ti,k=MX
j=1(Dti,j Dt0i,j),M=minfNi,N0ig (20)
in which Nirepresents the originally planned number of PM, and N0iis the number of PM activities
after the update.
However, the substantial RUL is wasted when the unit is repaired in advance and the penalty
cost is
CP(i,k,j)=ECiti,k (21)
The cost savings can be achieved based on Equations (17)‚Äì(21).
The maintenance activities of components can be regarded as a Ô¨Ånite set Fin terms of a
multi-component system. When a maintenance opportunity appears, each maintenance combination
F1,F2,:::,Flis a subcollection of F, satisfying
Fp\Fq=? p,q
F1[F2[:::[Fl=F(22)
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2020 ,13, 3518 8 of 17
The size of Fexplodes as the amount of element rises, making the solution process extremely
complicated. When a CM or planned PM is performed on component r(r2f1,:::ng), all the
opportunistic maintenance (OM) combination can be identiÔ¨Åed, and the expense preservation should be
C(Fl) =X
i2FlCS(i,r,j)i,r (23)
The OM combination corresponding to the maximum C(Fl)can be identiÔ¨Åed as the
optimized solution.
4.4. Rolling-Horizon Update
Ifti,1is the j-th maintenance execution time of unit i(i=1, 2,:::,N), thus, the following equations
can be established:
ti,1=tbegin+Dti,1 (24)
and
ti,j=ti,j 1+Dti,j 1+Wt(j>1) (25)
where tbegin is the initial time, which is generally set as 0. Dti,1is the interval of the Ô¨Årst PM activity.
Wtis the waiting time for a weather window. After completing a maintenance activity, the failure rate
of the corresponding component is renewed. If one preventative maintenance or failure replacement is
conducted for unit I, a new life period need to be started.
4.5. Maintenance Schedule Determination and Maintenance Cost Calculation
The total maintenance expenditure of OWT can be derived as follows when the last inspection
is accomplished.
CT=PT
k=0Ct
TL(26)
Lrepresents the inspection interval, and Trepresents the inspection time of the OWT operation

listed in [ 10,30]. These studies are the main references of the maintenance cost information for each
piece of component information in Table 1.

Assuming the capacity of the analyzed OWTs is 3 MW and the electricity tari is 0.1¬ø, therefore,
the Ô¨Ånancial loss caused by system unavailability is Cd(i)=3000240.1=7200 (¬ø/d).
The maintenance activities of OWTs are signiÔ¨Åcantly a ected by the marine environment such as
wind speed and e ective wave height [ 31,32]. The maintenance ship needs to wait for the appropriate
time to complete the O&M activities and a round trip. According to Scheu et al. [ 33], wave height is the
key factor to determine the accessibility of an o shore site. Generally, the signiÔ¨Åcant wave heights (Hs)

the winter months (December, January, February) wave height data in the North Atlantic Portuguese
waters. The results are presented in Table 2, demonstrating the waiting time for a weather window

5.2. Maintenance Optimization Based on Condition-Based Maintenance Method
In this paper, the cross-validation method is used to calculate the accuracy of fault evaluation
under a small amount of real data and verify the feasibility of the SVM algorithm. Then, white
noise is added to these real data to generate simulation data for the determination of maintenance
schedule. Due to the insu cient data, this paper veriÔ¨Åes the accuracy of the state assessment using
a cross-validation method (Figure 4). One of the OWTs is regarded as the veriÔ¨Åcation data, and the
remaining four were used as the training group, forming Ô¨Åve di erent grouping schemes, and the SVM
model is constructed and tested Ô¨Åve times. The advantage of this method is that the information of real
data is fully mined and the inÔ¨Çuence of simulation data on calculation results is avoided. The results
are presented in Table 7. Case 2 and Case 3 have the highest and lowest accuracy, which means
that the sample size has a signiÔ¨Åcant impact on the results. With the least amount of training data,
the accuracy of Case 3 is over 85%, indicating that the SVM classiÔ¨Åcation algorithm is able to recognize
the OWT fault.

This paper adds white noise based on existing statistics to generate a set of simulated data. 
According to industry suggestions, Gaussian noise is used to better simulate unknown real no ise. 
The real noise is regarded as the sum of various random variables with different probability 
distributions, and each random variable is independent. Based on the Central Limit Theorem, the 
normalized sum increases with the number of noise sources and is finally close to a Gaussian 
distribution. The Gaussian noise function is determined by four parameters: Œº, œÉ, m,  and n. According 
to industry suggestions, in this paper Œº is set to 3.5 and 55 in vibration and temperature series, 
respectively. œÉ is set t o 0.12 and 1.06 in vibration and temperature series, respectively. m and n

generator are relatively higher with in the entire system. In terms of pitch and gearbox, they have the 
highest repair frequency and expense respectively, explaining t heir large cost proportions. In Figure

The maintenance strategy can be divided into three categories, namely time -based maintenance 
(TBM), reliability -based maintenance (RBM), and the CBM method. The TBM method has been 
widely implemented in practi ce [35]. Under this maintenance strategy, PMs are carried out on device 
and structures at constant intervals , and CMs are con ducted after system malfunctions. In Goldwind 
Sci. and Tech. Co., Ltd., a leading wind energy developer in China, the period of overall inspection 
is six months. In order to improve the maintenance efficiency, researchers established different RBM 
and CBM models considering joint maintenance, attempting to achieve the optimized cost savings. 
This section performs a comparison analysis of five representative studies and the current paper ; the 
results are presented in Figure 8 and Table 10.  
Tuyet and Chou [36 ] used two -parameter Weibull distribution to describe the OWT degradation 
and established a maintenance optimization algorithm considering maintenance duration and power 
loss. The proposed grouping maintenance schedule saved 4.56% of maintenance cost over the 
baseline maintenance schedule. Xie et al. [37] developed the system degradation model based on the 
three -parameter Weibull distribution. The outcomes demonstrated that the failure rate short -term 
prediction of the three -parameter Weibull model was supe rior to the two -parameter Weibull model 
when the fault data were limited, improving the cost savings to 10%. Zhang et al. [38] presented a 
dynamic opportunistic maintenance strategy, considering the spare part arrangement issue the time 
window of waiting f or appropriate weather. In this research, when the wind speed is high, the 
maintenance decision tends to concentrate on restoring the OWT and starting its function as soon as 
possible, in order to generate more power. Conversely, when the wind speed is low , the decision -
making algorithm tends to carry out joint maintenance. The O&M cost for the presented method 
showed a decline of 18.3%.

of total maintenance times, which is caused by its high system complexity and frequent failures.
The generator is the largest contributor to maintenance cost due to its high failure rates and repair
expenditures. The rotor is the top assembly part in terms of cost savings, since it requires more
maintenance opportunities, and the cost of its single maintenance activity is relatively higher. It can be
concluded that the developed model provides an economically e cient method of OWT maintenance
planning. Future research could be conducted by taking into account the failure interactions between
OWT components and the limited maintenance resources, including vessels and technicians.
