Abstract
Fault detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety, availability, and reliability of modern industrial processes. Thisstudy focuses on data-driven fault detection methods, which have gained signiﬁcant attention across various industrial
sectors due to the rapid development of industrial automation technologies and the availability of extensive datasets. The
objectives of this paper are to comprehensively review and present the theoretical foundations of widely used data-drivenfault detection approaches. Speciﬁcally, these approaches are applied to fault detection in wind turbine systems, with
performance evaluation conducted using multiple statistical measures. The data utilized in this study were collected from a
simulated benchmark of a wind turbine system. The data-driven methods are tested under the assumption that the windturbine operates in a steady-state region. Additionally, a comparative study is conducted to identify and discuss the primary
challenges associated with the practical application of these methods in real-world scenarios. Simulation results show the
effectiveness and efﬁcacy of data-driven approaches concerning the sensitivity and robustness of wind turbine sensor faultsas applied in practical industrial environments.

1 Introduction
Fault detection and process monitoring have been active
areas of the research in the control community over the last
several decades [ 1–3]. Due to a large amount of stored data
in industrial databases, the data-driven process monitoringapproaches have attracted more attention because of their
simple design methods and low requirements on the
underlying mechanisms [ 4,5]. To effectively use the data-
driven approaches for process monitoring of large-scale
industrial systems with a huge amount of data, it is nec-
essary to perform pre-processing on the collected data toextract information, followed by dimensionality reduction
and the selection of the variables that explains a signiﬁcant
part of the observed process variation.
The multivariate statistical process monitoring methods
are considered the most popular among data-driven tech-
niques where they directly use the input–output measure-ments for process monitoring purposes. The basic
multivariate statistical process monitoring methods
including principal component analysis (PCA) [ 6,7], par-
tial least squares (PLS) [ 8], total projection to latent
structures (TPLS) [ 9], modiﬁed partial least squares
(MPLS) [ 10], orthogonal projection to latent structures (O-
PLS) [ 11], modiﬁed orthogonal projection to latent struc-
tures (MOPLS) [ 12], expectation-maximization partial
robust M-regression (EMPRM) [ 13], and total principal
component regression (TPCR) [ 14]. All these methods&Ahmed A. Gafar

have been successfully applied to many large industrial
processes, e.g., chemical plants, water treatment processes,
power grids, and cyber-physical systems [ 15–17]. It should
be noted that these monitoring methods are efﬁciently usedwith linear, single-mode, and time-invariant processes [ 18].
Today, wind turbine systems have been widely used to
convert wind energy into electricity as a renewable energysource [ 19–21]. Some wind turbines can produce power up
to 4.8 MW [ 22]. However, wind turbines can be subjected
to several faults whether they are sensor faults, actuator
faults, and system faults. For a wind turbine, the sensor
faults include pitch position sensor faults, rotor speedsensor faults, and generator speed sensor faults. On the
other hand, the actuator faults are due to converter coupling
faults and pitch system faults. Furthermore, system faultscan be found in the wind turbine drive train. It is worth
mentioning that unexpected failures of wind turbine parts
are the major cause of increased repair costs [ 23,24].
Fault detection and diagnosis in different ﬁelds have
attracted more attention in the literature. The research
papers can be classiﬁed according to the used fault detec-tion techniques into statistical techniques [ 25], machine
learning techniques [ 26], deep learning techniques [ 27–29],
vibration analysis techniques [ 30], and Hybrid techniques
[31]. Furthermore, there are two sources of data in these
researches that can be either simulated data [ 32]o r
SCADA data [ 33]. Moreover, deep learning methods have
been applied in many ﬁelds, and among these ﬁelds is the
ﬁeld of fault detection and diagnosis. Therefore, its
advantages are their ability to improve the accuracy ofpredictions and decision-making, the ability to learn from
unstructured data, such as images, text, and audio, and the
ability to automatically learn features from data, elimi-nating the need for manual feature engineering, but their
limitations are their high computational cost and their
dependence on the quality and quantity of data used fortraining.
Recently, data-driven techniques have been applied to a
wide range of applications, e.g fault classiﬁcation [ 34],
signal processing [ 35], image processing and pattern
recognition [ 36], modeling [ 37], real-time fatigue life
prediction of structures [ 38], and fuzzy sewage treatment
processes [ 39].
Although signiﬁcant efforts have been made in the
process monitoring of wind turbine systems, to the bestknowledge of the authors, there is no systematic compar-
ative studies of data-driven fault detection strategies are
available in the literature. Therefore, this is the mainmotivation behind this study. Due to the nature of this
study, the amount of mathematical equations behind the
different methodologies have been minimized, as there is awealth of knowledge in the literature on data-driven
methodologies. In addition to that, a detailed description ofthe benchmark of wind turbines including the models,
variables, and faults is presented to be as a reference to
other research studies.
The remainder of this study is presented in the following
structure. Section 2gives an overview of the basic data-
driven fault detection methods and their variants. Section 3
provides a detailed description of the wind turbine system.The presented fault detection methods are applied to a
simulated benchmark of wind turbines, and the compara-
tive results are presented in Sect. 4. Finally, the conclu-
sions are provided in Sect.
5.
2 Overview of data-driven techniques
In order to make it easier to compare different data-driven
techniques, we categorize them along a standard fault
detection and diagnosis (FDD) work-ﬂow for gathering andanalyzing measurements from manufacturing process.
Additionally, the basic multivariate statistical process
monitoring methods including: The principal componentanalysis (PCA) model is a statistical procedure in which a
set of correlated variables is converted into a set of linearly
independent variables that are called principal components.Moreover, PCA is regarded as one of the dimensional
reduction techniques in which the number of principal
components is always lower than the number of originalvariables. As well known, the fault detection issue in the
scope of the statistics is formulated by two hypotheses, the
null hypothesis, which represents the fault-free case, andthe alternative hypothesis, which represents the faulty-case
[40]. Assume that J
index andJth;index are the fault detection
index and its corresponding threshold, respectively. Then,
the fault detection logic is as follows:
Jindex/C20Jth;index null hypothesis (fault-free case) ;
Jindex[Jth;index alternative hypothesis (fault case) :/C26

Partial least square (PLS) is a popular input–output tech-
nique that is used for modeling, regression, fault detection,
and classiﬁcation purposes. Although the success of the
standard PLS model as a monitoring tool for quality-relatedprocess problems, it suffers from some problems such as it
requires many latent variables that include variations
orthogonal to the output Ybut are not useful for predicting
the output Y[41]. Moreover, residual subspace usually has
quite large variations that are not proper to be monitored.
[9] proposed the TPLS algorithm to treat the standard PLS
model-associated problems. TPLS model works well for
characterizing the observed Xand is appropriate for mon-
itoring various parts of X. In spite of this, TPLS is not able
to totally eliminate impacts. Therefore, as fault amplitude10280 Neural Computing and Applications (2024) 36:10279–10296

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
increases, the amount of undesired variability will rise to a
point where the post-processing techniques are useless.
MPLS is another variant of PLS in which the orthogonal
decomposition on regression variable space is applied to
eliminate the useless variations for output prediction. Therelated computation cost of the modiﬁed strategy elimi-
nates the shortcomings of the traditional PLS algorithm and
is signiﬁcantly simpler than that of the standard technique.Orthogonal projection to latent structures (OPLS) has been
used to reduce the number of latent variables while main-
taining good prediction accuracy. The OPLS approach is a
combination between PLS and a pre-processing technique
that is used for removing components that orthogonal to theoutput Yfrom the input X[42].
MOPLS methodology is a combination of both OPLS
and MPLS algorithms deﬁned in the previous subsections.One of its main advantages is its lower complexity since it
reduces the number of latent variables. The EMPRM
algorithm has a smaller predicted offset and a more accu-rate predicted output than the PLS algorithm. The expec-
tation-maximization (EM) phase consists of two steps: the
expectation step and the maximization one. In the former,the missing elements are ﬁlled with the expected values. In
the latter, the expected values are updated using the data in
which missing elements are included have been ﬁlled in.TPCR model is used to solve the quality-related fault
detection issue for linear systems [ 14]. However, TPCR is
inappropriate for automobile applications but is suitable forstatistical processes. In the following subsections, the
essential mathematical background for the discussed data-
driven techniques is presented.
2.1 Principal component analysis
The ﬁrst step in building a PCA model for the fault
detection process is to collect the normal dataset
X¼x1x2...xN ½/C138T2RN/C2M, with Mis the process variables
andNis the number of measurements. The second step is
to normalize the data matrix Xwith data mean and variance
to ensure that all variables have equal weight and to pre-vent a set of variables from dominating the fault detection
process [ 43]. The third step is to build the PCA model
which can be done by calculating the sample covariance
matrix S¼
1
N/C01XTX, and then applying the singular value
decomposition (SVD) method to calculate the loading
vectors which are considered the new coordinates of the
data. Generally, PCA model decomposes the original data
measurement space into the principal component subspace(PCS), S
p= span ðPÞand the residual subspace (RS), Sr
= span ðePÞ[18,41].X¼bXþeX¼TPTþeTeP ð2Þ
where T2RN/C2landeT2RN/C2M/C0lare the score matrices in
the PCS and RS, respectively, and l/C28Mis the number of
the principal components that can be determined by using
different methods [ 44]. In general, The PCS contains the
data that show the most variation, while the RS typically
includes data with little variation, which is primarily noise.
For an online sample vector, x2RM, the principal and
residual components are obtained by projecting xon both
two subspaces, PCS and RS according to the following:
x¼bxþex¼PPTxþePePTx¼PPTxþI/C0PPT/C0/C1
xð3Þ
where I2RM/C2Mis an identity matrix. Typically, there are
two indices are used to monitor normal the variability in
PCS and RS, i.e., Hotelling’s T2and the squared prediction
error SPE. Hotelling’s T2captures the variations in the
PCS. On the other hand, the SPE index measures the
variations in RS. Therefore, the two monitoring indiceswith their thresholds for a given signiﬁcant level [ 45,46]
can be calculated as Table 1:
2.2 Partial least squares
Generally, the PLS partitions the input space into a prin-
cipal subspace Spand a residual subspace Sr. Given a
measurement data matrix (regression variables) X¼

implemented using the nonlinear iterative partial least
squares algorithm (NIPALS) to calculate P,T,Q, and R
matrices [ 47,48]. Similarly to the PCA model, there are
two indices used for fault detection extracted from PLS
model, i.e., Hotelling’s T2
PLS statistic that is used for
monitoring the variations in the Sprelated to the quality
output data Y. On the other side, the residual subspace Sris
monitored by the SPE PLSstatistic which represents the
variations unrelated to Y. Therefore, the two monitoring
indices with their thresholds can be calculated as Table 2:
2.3 Total projection to latent structures (TPLS)
The main idea of the TPLS model is to decompose the
input data space, X, into four parts instead of two parts as in
the standard PLS:
X¼TyPT
yþToPT
oþTrPT
rþeXr
Y¼bYþeY¼TQTþeYð6Þ
where Tyis a score matrix that is directly correlated with Y
in the original T, and Tois orthogonal to Yin the original T.
Furthermore, Tris the main part in eX, andeXr¼
eXI/C0PrPT
r/C0/C1
is the residual part in eXthat represents the
noise. Py,Po,Prare the loading vectors that span the
corresponding subspaces. It is clear that the TPLS model is
able to monitor different parts of X. Therefore, there are
four monitoring statistics, i.e., T2
y,T2
r,T2
o, and SPE rwith
their thresholds that can be calculated according to the
following [ 49] as Table 3:
More details about the TPLS model are given in the
research work of [ 9]. It should be noted that both T2
yand
SPE rare used to detect the faults related to Y. On the
contrary, ToandTrare used together to detect the faults
that are not related to Y. It should be noted that SPE ris
more sensitive to incipient faults compared with SPE in the
standard PLS [ 9].
2.4 Modified partial least squares (MPLS)
The following desired relation can be calculated:Y¼bYþeY¼XMþeY ð7Þ
where Mis the matrix of the regression coefﬁcient and
contains correlation information between XandY. More-
over,bYandeYare the subspaces that are correlated and
uncorrelated with X, respectively. The coefﬁcient matrix,
Mcan be easily calculated as:
M¼XTX/C0/C1/C01XTY ð8Þ
By applying the SVD technique, the MPLS model
decomposes the original data measurement space into the
principal component subspace (PCS), Sp= span ðPM) and
the residual subspace (RS), Sr= span ðePM)[50].

Accordingly, the fault detection process can be achieved
using two monitoring statistics, T2

mentioning that T2
Mstatistic is used for monitoring bXwhich
enables detecting faults that are related to Y. On the other
hand, the SPE Mstatistic is used for monitoring eX, thus it
can detect faults that are unrelated to Y. Therefore, the
monitoring statistics, i.e., T2
M, SPE Mwith their thresholds
can be calculated as Table 4
More details about the MPLS algorithm are given in the
research work of [ 50].
2.5 Orthogonal projection to latent structures
(OPLS)
The original measurement data matrix Xis converted into a
ﬁltered matrix Xoplswhich in turn is decomposed by the
OPLS algorithm into two subspaces bXoplsandeXopls.
Xopls¼bXoplsþeXopls ð10Þ
wherebXopls is highly correlated with YandeXopls is
uncorrelated with Y. Similarly, the aforementioned sub-
spaces can be monitored by two indices, i.e., T2

SPE opls. Therefore, the two monitoring statistics, i.e., T2
opls,
SPE oplswith their thresholds can be calculated as Table 5:
2.6 Modified orthogonal projection to latent

In this technique, the process data matrix Xis decomposed
into orthogonal data, X?, and ﬁltered data Xopls. First, the
PCA model is used for Monitoring X?that are uncorrelated

is used to monitor Xoplswhich in turn decomposed into
bXoplsandeXopls. The monitoring results of bXoplsandeXopls
reveal quality-related and quality-unrelated faults, respec-
tively. The principal and residual components are obtainedby projecting x

2.7 Expectation–maximization partial least

Algebraically, the ﬁnal regression coefﬁcient vector MEMis
obtained from the last PLS step in the ﬁnal iteration of
EMPRM algorithm that is summarized in [ 52].
Similarly, by applying the singular value decomposition
(SVD) method, the EMPRM model decomposes the orig-
inal data measurement space Xand Yinto the principal

their thresholds can be calculated as Table 7.
More details about the EMPRM model are given in the
research work of [ 52].
2.8 Total principal component regression (TPCR)
The basic idea of this algorithm is that the original process
matrix Xis ﬁrst projected onto the score matrix Tby PCA.
Tcis a score matrix that is extracted from Tby the least
squares regression between Tand Y. After that, Xcis
reconstructed from XbyTcsuch that Xcis highly correlated
with Y, leaving the remaining part Xuis uncorrelated with
Y. To build the TPCR model, the PCA is performed on bYto
get its score matrix Tcand load matrix Qcsuch that:
Tc¼bYQ c¼TQTQc ð14Þ
wherebYis the online prediction of Y,QT¼TTTðÞ/C01TTY,
andTis re-projected to TcbyQTQc. Next, we reconstruct
Xcfrom Tcby the following steps:

Thus:

By performing PCA on Xu, we get its score matrix Tuand

follows:

as Table 8.
To summarize the main components of the fault detec-
tion approaches given in this paper, the ofﬂine and online
phases are described in the following ﬂowchart, see Fig. 1.
The main terminologies and abbreviations of the algo-rithms are summarized in table 15.
3 Wind turbine system
It is well known that wind turbines convert the kinetic
energy of wind into electrical energy. The main compo-
nents are the tower, the rotor and hub (including three
blades), the nacelle, and the generator as shown in Fig. 2.
Wind turbines may generate several GW yearly that are
used around the world. Therefore, they have attracted many
investments in the ﬁeld of renewable energy sources. It isworth mentioning that the parts of wind turbines may have
malfunctions that should be detected using fault detection
schemes. As mentioned in the introduction section, thereare two sources of the wind turbine systems data including
the SCADA and simulated data. In the paper, we collect the
data from a benchmark of a wind turbine system that ispopularly used for evaluating the controller and process
monitoring schemes [ 53–55]. The wind turbine model
consists of a horizontal-axis three-blade turbine with fullconverter coupling and is connected to the generator via a
gearbox, see Fig. 2. The conversion from wind energy to
mechanical energy can be controlled using the aerody-
namics of the wind turbine. Using the generator coupled to
a converter coupling, mechanical energy is converted toelectrical energy. The drive train (Gearbox) between the
rotor and the generator increases the generator’s speed.Table 6 MOPLS monitoring

Table 9summarizes the main signals exchanged among the
subsystems.
The wind turbine model consists of different parts, i.e.,
controller, drive train, generator/converter, wind, blade andpitch subsystems as shown in Fig. 3. The main variables of
the wind turbine system are summarized in table 16.
Moreover, because the wind turbine system is a multi-
mode system, the controller has to work in four operating
zones, which are determined according to the average wind
speed within a certain time window as depicted in Fig. 4
[56]. It is clearly shown from this ﬁgure that the turbine is
at standstill at Region I and Region II represents the power
optimization with partial load. Whenever, Region III andRegion IV describe the constant power generation and high
wind speed, respectively. In this paper, the wind turbine is
assumed to work at Region III which represents the steady-state operation of the wind turbine system. The turbine is
controlled at wind speed between 0 and v
rated m/s in order
to achieve the optimal power generation. The speed ratio isgiven by:

The utilization of wind energy for the wind power
generation system is a subject of research interest and in
the recent years, the focus is on the cost-effective use ofwind energy with the aim of providing electricity of high
quality and reliability. In the past twenty years, wind tur-
bine sizes have evolved from 20-kW to 5-megawatts, whileeven more powerful wind turbines are being developed.
Therefore, in order to prevent major component failures,
fault detection algorithms enable early alarms of mechan-
ical and electrical faults. Side effects on other components
can be signiﬁcantly reduced.
Furthermore, many faults can be detected even when the
faulty component is still working. Thus, necessary repairs
can be planned in time and do not have to be carried outimmediately. Therefore, this is important because wind
power generation system is inaccessible because they are
located on extremely high towers, typically 20 m or higher[57]. This is also particularly important for wind turbine
installations, where adverse weather conditions (storms,
high tides, etc.) can prevent repair action for several weeks.
Therefore, maintenance costs and downtime of wind
power generation system can be signiﬁcantly reduced [ 58].
Therefore, due to the importance of fault detection anddiagnosis in wind power generation system (blades, drive
train, and generator), this paper is presented to be as a
reference to other research studies as shown in Fig. 5
[25,57]. For illustration, this ﬁgure shows the main wind
turbine components that are concerned by the above
benchmark model.
In summary, the sensors are mainly used for the blade
load reduction based on the individual pitch control strat-
egy, especially in offshore wind turbines. The lifetime ofthe sensors in wind turbine systems is usually not very
long. There are several factors that lead to higher failure
rates. The strain in the blades can be very high, whichaffects the gauges themselves and the bonding. Harsh
environmental factors such as lightning, salt spray, mois-
ture, corrosion can directly affect the bonding and wiringof the sensors. Maintenance personnel can easily damage
the sensors [ 25].

3.2 Blade and pitch model
This model combines the aerodynamic and the pitch
models. The aerodynamic subsystem describes the forces
that an air ﬂow develops on a wind turbine and transformsthe three-dimensional wind ﬁeld into concentrated forces.
As can be seen in the block diagram of Fig. 3, the inputs to
this subsystem are the wind speed v
w, the pitch angle b, and
the rotation speed of the rotor xr. The output of this sub-
system is the aerodynamic torque sr. The torque equation
of this subsystem is [ 56]:
srðtÞ¼qpr3CqðcðtÞ;bðtÞÞtwðtÞ2
2ð28Þ
where CqðcðtÞ;bðtÞÞis a map of the torque coefﬁcients that
represent a function of the speed ratio with the lead angle
andqis the air density. A simple representative is used to
model the three blades to obtain their pitch angle value.
This assumption suppose that the torque of each blade isone-third of the torque that is given by the three blades.
Therefore, the torque equation of this subsystem is:
s
rðtÞ¼X3
i¼1qpr3CqðcðtÞ;biðtÞÞtw;iðtÞ2
6ð29Þ
where biis the pitch position.
On the other hand, the pitch subsystem is an actuator
that generally rotates all the blades or a part of them.Therefore, the model of the hydraulic pitch system isconsidered as a closed-loop transfer function between the
measured pitch angle ( b
m) and its reference ( br). In prin-
ciple, this subsystem can be modeled by a second-ordertransfer function [ 60] as:

n

nð30Þ
where bris the input to the closed-loop transfer function;
bmis the output of the transfer function; fis the damping
factor, and xnis the natural frequency.
3.3 Drive train model
A two-mass model of the drive train is used in this
benchmark model. The torque from the rotor is transferred
to the generator through the drive train. From the low-speed rotor side to the high-speed generator side, the
rotational speed is increased using a gearbox. A two-mass
drive train model can be represented by:

than the electrical system in the wind turbine system. A

system level.

It is worth mentioning that many fault types are occur-
ring in wind turbine systems including sensor faults,actuator faults, and process faults. This paper is dedicated
to studying the efﬁciency of the presented process moni-
toring methodologies for sensor faults detection. The sen-sor faults can be in the pitch position measurements, e.g.,
b
1;m1b1;m2b2;m1b2;m2b3;m1;b3;m2; in the rotor speed mea-
surements, xr;m1andxr;m2; in the generator speed mea-
surements xg;m1andxg;m2. The details of these faults are
listed in Table 11.
4 Simulation results and discussion
In this simulation study for a wind turbine system, the
measurement data are collected from 16 variables at nor-
mal operation. The dataset includes 105samples, and the
fault scenarios are presented at a sample time k=5/C2104
to the end of the simulation. Twenty different fault sce-
narios are given in Table 11that occur in the wind turbine
system. The rotational speed of the rotor in the drive train
is chosen as the quality variable to construct Ymatrix
(output variable) and the other 15 process variables arechosen as input variables. Furthermore, the different fault
scenarios are monitored using the presented data-driven
fault detection approaches in this paper and evaluated byusing two indices, i.e., fault detection rate (FDR) and false
alarm rate (FAR) [ 9,43,61].Table 11 Sensor faults in the

The number of principal components (PCs) and the number
of LVs are selected by using the cumulative percent vari-ance method (CPV) and the cross-validation method,
respectively [ 9,44,62]. The design parameters are sum-
marized in Table 12.
Two fault scenarios are given in details, i.e., F14 and
F19. The ﬁrst fault occurs as a gain factor in the pitch
position sensor. Figure 6shows the fault detection charts of
the described monitoring models in this paper. It is clearly
shown that the monitoring models achieved FDR with
average about 80 %. Furthermore, PCA, TPLS recorded the
lowest FAR, but the other methods have the highest degree
of FAR compared with the PCA and TPLS.
Besides, F19 represents a ﬁxed value in the sensor that
measures the generator speed. The fault detection results ofthe presented methods of this fault are shown in Fig. 7.I ti s
clearly shown that all the tested algorithms showed satis-
factory fault detection performance with FDRs of approx-imately 99 :99%except for PCA algorithm that failed to
detect fault successfully as shown in Fig. 7a. As well as, all
monitoring methodologies exhibit acceptable FARs.
To evaluate the fault detection approaches according to
all possible sensor faults, Tables 13and14give the FDRs
and FARS. As shown in Table 13, most fault detection
methods successfully detected all faults with high FDRs.
On the other side, the PCA and TPLS could not detect the
faults (F13, F14, F15, F16, F19) and F9, respectively, inwhich the boldface denotes the lowest FDRs.
It is clearly shown from Table 14that the FARs of both
PCA and TPLS had the lowest FAR rates for all faultscenarios, which means they are the most robust fault
detection methods. As well as other algorithms in some
fault scenarios have high FARs which are denoted by theboldface.123456789 1 0

The detectability of the described fault detection
approaches in this paper is clearly shown in Fig. 8that
represents the average value of FDR’s of all possible
sensor fault cases. The MPLS achieved the highest average
FDR comparable to other methodologies. As well as, Fromthe point of view of robustness, Fig. 9introduces a com-
parison of the fault detection techniques in terms of FARs.
It is well proven that both TPLS and PCA are the mostrobust fault detection techniques.
In summary, the data-driven methods are tested under
the assumption that the wind turbine operates in a steady-state region. Simulation results demonstrate that PLS
(Partial Least Squares) and its variants exhibit the highest
sensitivity to wind turbine sensor faults. Additionally, mostof the fault detection methodologies, including MPLS,
EMPRM, MOPLS, TPCR, OPLS, PLS, and TPLS, suc-
cessfully detected all faults with a high Fault DetectionRate (FDR) with average about 90.57%, 88.55%, 88.52%,
88.12%, 88.09%, 86.55%, and 80.95%, respectively. Onthe other hand, PCA exhibited the lowest FDR compared to
the other methods with average about 68.86%. Addition-ally, this is because PCA cannot establish the correlation
between quality and process variables. However, PCA still
outperformed PLS and its variants in terms of robustness tothese faults, which directly relates to the False Alarm Rate
(FAR), i.e, PCA with average FAR about 1.02% is less
than TPCR, MOPLS, PLS, OPLS, EMPRM, and MPLSwith average FAR about 14.17%, 14.70%, 17.93%,
19.18%, 19.74%, and 22.96%, respectively, except TPLS
has the lowest average FAR of about 0.2%.

Detection Rate (FDR) averaging around 90 %. On the other
hand, PCA exhibited the lowest FDR compared to the other
methods. However, PCA still outperformed PLS and itsvariants in terms of robustness to these faults, which
directly relates to the False Alarm Rate (FAR). It should be
noted that the discussed fault detection methods in thispaper are efﬁcient in dealing with single-mode, time-in-
variant systems. Real wind turbines, however, are multi-
mode systems with high nonlinearity. Therefore, futureresearch efforts should focus on the development of pro-
cess monitoring methods capable of effectively handling
these challenges.
