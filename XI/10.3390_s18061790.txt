Abstract: Regular inspection for the maintenance of the wind turbines is difﬁcult because of their
remote locations. For this reason, condition monitoring systems (CMSs) are typically installed to
monitor their health condition. The purpose of this study is to propose a fault detection algorithm for
the mechanical parts of the wind turbine. To this end, long-term vibration data were collected over
two years by a CMS installed on a 3 MW wind turbine. The vibration distribution at a speciﬁc rotating
speed of main shaft is approximated by the Weibull distribution and its cumulative distribution
function is utilized for determining the threshold levels that indicate impending failure of mechanical
parts. A Hidden Markov model (HMM) is employed to propose the statistical fault detection
algorithm in the time domain and the method whereby the input sequence for HMM is extracted is
also introduced by considering the threshold levels and the correlation between the signals. Finally,
it was demonstrated that the proposed HMM algorithm achieved a greater than 95% detection success
rate by using the long-term signals.

1. Introduction
Wind turbines are one of the most remarkable renewable energy generation systems and many
studies have been being conducted to reduce their operating cost. A survey on the total cost of wind
power generation cost concluded that the operating cost, which includes maintenance (O&M), training
operators and engineers, repair, system upgrades, inventory etc., is larger than capital costs, such as
facility design, development planning, and construction. Concretely, the maintenance cost accounts
for more than 25% of the total cost [1,2].
In practice it is not easy to perform regular inspections for the maintenance of wind turbines that
are located at inaccessible places, such as mountaintops, shorelines, or oceans, and deserts. In addition,
unexpected faults may happen due to an abrupt change in the environmental conditions including
extreme weather events as well as performance degradation. These issues have been addressed by
using condition monitoring systems (CMSs). This are a part of predictive maintenance (PdM) [ 3,4] and
are installed to detect abnormal conditions of the mechanical parts of wind turbines in advance. PdM,
which is also known as condition-based maintenance (CBM), attempts to evaluate the condition of
an asset by performing periodic or continuous monitoring [ 1]. According to a report by the Electrical
Power Research Institute (EPRI) [ 5], when a power plant is managed through PdM, its maintenance
costs have a minimum ﬁve-fold beneﬁt in comparison with the maintenance costs through visual
inspection and ten-fold in comparison with the total cost after problems occur. For this reason, it is

expected that the economics of wind power generation can be improved if a CMS allows early fault
detection of mechanical systems.
A CMS consists of sensors, data acquisition equipment, and signal processing algorithms.
Sensors are typically used for vibration analysis, temperature analysis using thermocouples and/or
thermography, ultrasonic testing, oil analysis, strain measurement, acoustic emission test, electrical
effect measurements, and so on [ 6–10]. Among them, vibration is the most effective quantity measured
in rotary wind turbines [10].
Signal processing algorithms are utilized to examine the health conditions of the mechanical
components of wind turbines by extracting important information from the various types of sensors
which collect information in two representative dimensions: time and frequency. Time-domain signal
processing such as statistical methods, trend analysis, and ﬁltering makes use of overall and/or
average quantities and is applied to monitor the health condition of wind turbines. Plots of data, such
as rotational speed with time, allow for comparison with pre-deﬁned thresholds: warning and alarm
levels. The time-domain signal processing method is very useful for determining whether a wind
turbine has crossed a threshold that indicates a dangerous condition.
Frequency-domain signal processing based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is employed to
diagnose where and how a wind turbine behaves abnormally . Considering frequency-based methods such
as spectrum, envelope, and Cepstrum analyses using vibration signals, requires previous understanding
of how the frequency is affected when a component behaves abnormally . In the case of variable rotational
speed, waterfall analysis using wavelet, short time Fourier transform (STFT) and order analysis [11] can
be applied for detecting abnormal symptoms of wind turbines. These kinds of conventional methods
have two main problems. One deals with each sensor’s physical data individually , but does not consider
interrelationships with other types of sensors data. The other is a difficulty in analyzing non-linear and
non-stationary data, which reflect changes of wind speed and rotation speed. For these reasons, more
advanced signal processing techniques such as angular resampling [ 12] have been being investigated for
monitoring the health condition of wind turbines with greater reliability .
There are numerous expert approaches for the machine diagnosis and prognosis when implementing
CBM and they can also apply to fault monitoring of the wind turbines. The ways can be divided into three
categories: physical models, artificial intelligence (AI) models, and hybrid models. The physical model is
based on mathematical or logical representations of the mechanical system and therefore it is also named
a white-box method. On the contrary, AI models are considered black-box methods because they can
be applied to diagnose or predict without knowing the internal relationship of the mechanical system.
Among the AI models, the artificial neural network (ANN) has been mainly applied to classification and
recognition problems because it has a good theoretical background and can perform non-linear feature
mapping with high accuracy [ 13,14]. The Hidden Markov model (HMM) is widely used for pattern
and/or speech recognition because it has an excellent mathematical basis and is an efficient modeling
tool for sequences with temporal constraints [ 15]. The hybrid model integrates two or more individual
white-box and/or black-box methods for eliminating the limitations inherent in each method. However,
it is still difficult to indicate a specific method which can generally apply to any problem because its
performance depends on database representing the problem [13].
The purpose of this study is to propose a fault detection algorithm for the mechanical system of
wind turbines in order to upgrade the function of CMS. To this end, wind turbines with a capacity
of3 MW are employed and they consist of a rotor blade, main shaft and bearing, gearbox, and
permanent magnetic synchronous generator (PMSG). Long-term data over two years including
vibration, wind speed, rotating speed, etc. were collected by their CMS. First, the structure of a
wind turbine, its operating phases, and installed CMS are brieﬂy explained in Section 2. Subsequently
relationships among the operating conditions of wind turbine, wind speed, shaft rotating speed, and
power are investigated. Trend analysis on vibration signals is conducted as a function of the number
of the revolutions of the main shaft in order to ﬁnd out its distribution and alarm thresholds are
determined which indicate abnormalities of the mechanical system in Section 3. Third, correlation

analysis of the vibration signals is used to ﬁnd coupling of physical components. Then, a HMM is
employed to propose the statistical fault detection algorithm in the time domain and take its input
sequence considering the correlation between vibration signals in Section 4.1. Lastly, the performance
of the proposed HMM is investigated by introducing in Section 4.2 some metrics that can account for
the imbalance of datasets.
2. Wind T urbine and Its Condition Monitoring System
2.1. Operation of Wind Turbine
The mechanical system of a wind turbine capable of generating power consists of a rotor blade,
main shaft, gearbox, and generator. The rotor blade and main shaft rotate at low speed and the gearbox
increases the speed so that generator makes power. The wind turbine is controlled to ensure safe operation
and stable power generation in several phases [ 16,17]. An initialization phase is used to check each part
of the wind turbine before operation and determine the positions of rotor and yaw. A preparation phase
monitors the proper operation condition by checking the wind direction and speed and starts to monitor
the connection between transmission parts. A checking phase judges whether operation is possible
considering the variations and duration of the wind. These three phases occur prior to operation.
Astart-up phase releases the brake system after conﬁrming the wind speed and starts to run
the wind turbine. A generating phase generates power when the operating speed is normal. During
the power generation in these two phases, that is, the wind turbine is connected to the power grid,
the generator is subjected to a certain load. A free-running phase allows free rotation of the rotor when
the wind speed is not enough to generate power and at that time, yaw controls the direction of the
rotor through the wind direction. Finally, a stopping phase stops the rotor by adjusting the aerodynamic
drag device and the pitch of rotor blade. These four steps are for the operation of the wind turbine and
for the power generation.

CMS is utilized for solving the difﬁculties related to the maintenance of wind turbines. Figure 1
shows the mechanical parts of the wind turbine used in this study and the positions of sensors for
its CMS. Accelerometers and temperature sensors are installed to measure the vibration signals and
temperature, respectively, of the following mechanical parts: rotor, main shaft bearing, gearbox, and
generator. Environmental and operation variables such as wind direction, wind speed and generated
power are also measured.

These data are obtained with a sampling frequency of several thousand kHz and more using data
acquisition equipment, but averaged data is used and stored at the interval of 1 s to monitor the status
of the wind turbine. For vibration signals, the acceleration measured in each mechanical part is treated
as two values based on the criteria of IEC 61400-25-6 [ 18,19]. One is the root mean square (RMS) value
of acceleration components below the frequency 1 kHz and the other is a RMS value after applying a
high pass ﬁlter with a cut-off frequency 1 kHz. The latter is also called as high frequency bandpass
components (HFBP). Table 1 summarizes the main vibration signals treated in this study and here, X,
Y, and Z indicate the vibration directions: horizontal, vertical, and axial to the main shaft. Wind speed
and generated power are also averaged at an interval of 1 s. The data used in this study is gathered
during a period greater than two years; the number of data per channel is about 45 million.

3. Vibration Signals and Their Alarm Thresholds
3.1. Relation between Wind Speed, Rotating Speed of Main Shaft, and Generated Power
3.1.1. Distribution of Wind Speed
The most important environmental variable in wind power generation is a wind speed. As stated
in Section 2.1, the wind speed and its duration are key parameters that affect the operation phase of a
wind turbine and the generated power. Therefore, the distribution of wind speed at the site where the
wind turbines will are located should be investigated in advance.
Figure 2a shows the distribution of wind speed measured at wind turbine No.1 and Frequency is
the ratio of the frequency at interval of 1 m/s deﬁned as follows:
Frequency (%)=(No.o f data at each wind speed )/(No.o f all data )100. (1)
During the measurement period, maximum frequency (mode) of wind speeds occurs at 3 m/s
and there are few wind speeds faster than 18 m/s. If one applies the normal distribution function
commonly used for approximating this kind of distribution, the mean value ( m) is 5.0 m/s and standard
deviation ( s) is 3.0 m/s. This difference between mode and the mean values of the wind speed can be
explained due to the discrepancy between the normal distribution’s symmetry and the skewness of
the actual wind distribution; see the comparison of the probability distribution function in Figure 2a.
To solve the problem, the Weibull distribution is introduced that is used for simulating reliability
data. It is usually applied to residual time prediction, weather forecasting, failure analysis, etc. and
deﬁned as follows [20]:

where xis a positive real number, aa scale factor and ba shape factor. Figure 2b shows examples of the
Weibull distribution as a function of the shape factor using scale factor of 5. It shows that the Weibull
distribution is asymmetric at low shape factors and approaches the normal distribution at greater shape
factors. The probability density function of Weibull distribution with a scale factor of 5.7 and a shape
factor of 1.8 is plotted and compared with the distribution of the wind speed in Figure 2a. From the result,
it is found that the Weibull distribution can be utilized as a tool to simulate the distribution of wind speed.

3.1.2. Wind Speed vs. Rota ting Speed of Main Shaft  
As stated at Section  2.1, the probability that the main shaft rotates is increased when the wind 
speed is fast and  its duration is long. Figure 3a  shows the relation between wind speed and rotating 
speed of main shaft. The main sha ft may or may not rotate if the wind speed is 3 m/s, the highest 
frequency  of wind speed. If the rotational speed of the main shaft is zero, the operating phases are 
initialization , preparation , and checking ; in the case of 8 revolution per minute (rpm), t he phases are 
start -up, generation , and free-run. That  is, it means that the operating condition s may differ even at 
identical wind speed s. In the range of wind speeds of 5~ 8 m/s, the number of revolutions increases 
according to the wind speed. However, at  wind speeds of 9 m/s and more, it remained at 16 rpm. 
This is because the control system precludes  excessi ve rotation for safe operation.

3.1.3. Rotating Speed of Main Shaft vs. Generated Power  
Figure 3 b shows the relation between rotating speed of main shaft and generated power. Power 
generat ion is started at start -up and is done mainly during generation . In fact, the amount of generated 
power is very low when the revolution is lower than 8 rpm. However, there is a considerable amount 
of time in which there is no generated power even if the ro tational speed is higher than 8 rpm. This 
is because the generator does not work during start -up and free-running . When  the rotational speed 
increases from 1 0 to 15 rpm, the amount of generated power is more than 0. 5 MW and maximum 
power is generated at a  rotational speed of 16 rpm. This means that all power transmission systems 
of wind turbine combine and operate when the rotational speed is above 10 rpm.  
Compared with Figure 3a , it can be seen that the rotation of the main shaft depends on the wind 
spee d and it influences the generated power. Stable power generation is possible if the wind speed 
remains at 5 m/s or more. From these results, the number of revolutions of the main shaft could be 
utilized as a useful parameter when analyzing vibration signal s obtained from CMS in this study.  
3.2. Trend Analysis of Vibration Signals  
Distribution of Vibration Signals  
The vibration signal is the most important physical quantity that reflects health condition of a 
wind turbine’s power transmission systems such a s main shaft, gearbox, and generator. In this 
section, the variation of vibration is investigated and approximated in the statistical manner as shown 
in Figure 4.  
 
Figure 4.  Procedure of trend analysis on vibration signal ; pdf = probability density functi on. 
First, measured vibration signals in the time domain are transformed as a function of the number 
of revolutions of the main shaft in rpm and then the mean and standard deviation of the data at ea ch 
rpm are calculated. Figure 5a  shows the variation tren ds of mean values of acceleration in the y -
direction measured on the bearing of the main shaft. The acceleration is small until 7 rpm and there 
is almost no change even if rpm increases. However, since the mechanical system including the 
generator starts t o be subjected to a load for generating power at the range over 8 rpm, the 
acceleration gradually increases. At high wind speed, the number of revolution remains constant 
through blade pitch control. For the wind turbine used in this study, the revolution is 18 rpm. In this

generation is started at start-up and is done mainly during generation . In fact, the amount of generated
power is very low when the revolution is lower than 8 rpm. However, there is a considerable amount

because the generator does not work during start-up and free-running . When the rotational speed
increases from 10 to 15 rpm, the amount of generated power is more than 0.5 MW and maximum
power is generated at a rotational speed of 16 rpm. This means that all power transmission systems of
wind turbine combine and operate when the rotational speed is above 10 rpm.
Compared with Figure 3a, it can be seen that the rotation of the main shaft depends on the wind
speed and it inﬂuences the generated power. Stable power generation is possible if the wind speed
remains at 5 m/s or more. From these results, the number of revolutions of the main shaft could be
utilized as a useful parameter when analyzing vibration signals obtained from CMS in this study.

For the wind turbine used in this study, the revolution is 18 rpm. In this process, the amount of load
varies to increase the amount of generating power and that is the reason why the vibration is changed
at 18 rpm.
Figure 5b shows the variation of vibration measured at the high-speed part of gearbox. It has the
same trend as the vibration of the bearing of main shaft. The difference is that HFBP is greater than
RMS in the gearbox but reversed in the bearing. That is because the rotation speed of the gearbox is
accelerated as fast as the gear ratio compared with the main shaft and therefore, the high frequency
vibration components mainly occur.
Figure 5c shows the variation of vibration measured at the generator as a function of the rotational
speed of the main shaft. The generator connected with the high-speed part of gearbox also rotates with
the high speed and so HFBP is as large as 10 times the RMS. In particular, unlike the tendency of main
shaft and gearbox, HFBP increases abruptly at 8 rpm and tends to be similar or decrease at the range
higher 8 rpm. This is because, as mentioned above, generator is subjected to a load to generate power.
Next, the frequency distribution of the vibration signal is investigated as a function of the rotational
speed and acceleration of the main shaft. As an example, Figure 6a shows the vibration in the
y-direction of the bearing of main shaft. At a speciﬁc rpm, the frequency increases up to a maximum
value and then decreases exponentially. This tendency also occurs in the gearbox and generator, which
is similar to the relationship between rpm and wind speed.
Based on this result, the ﬁnal step is to approximate the frequency variation of the vibration signal
at each rpm with the Weibull distribution. Figure 6b is an example simulating the distribution of RMS
value from Figure 6a. This approximation employs a statistical approach to the vibration distribution
at a speciﬁc rpm of the main shaft.

 process, the amount of load varies to increase the amount of generating power and that is the reason 
why the vibration is changed at 18 rpm.  
Figure 5 b shows the variation of vibration measured at the high -speed part of gearbox. It has th e 
same trend as the vibration of the bearing of main shaft. The difference is that HFBP is greater than 
RMS in the gearbox but reversed in the bearing. That is because the rotation speed of the gearbox is 
accelerated as fast as the gear ratio compared with  the main shaft and therefore, the high frequency 
vibration components mainly occur.  
Figure 5 c shows the variation of vibration measured at the generator as a function of the 
rotational speed of the main shaft. The generator connected with the high -speed part of gearbox also 
rotates with the high speed and so HFBP is as large as 10 times the RMS. In particular, unlike the 
tendency of main shaft and gearbox, HFBP increases abruptly at 8 rpm and tends to be similar or 
decrease at the range higher 8 rpm. This  is because, as mentioned above, generator is subjected to a 
load to generate power.  
Next, the frequency  distribution of the vibration signal is investigated as a function of the 
rotational speed and acceleration of the main  shaft. As an example, Figure 6a  shows the vibration in 
the y -direction of the bearing of main shaft. At a specific rpm, the frequency  increases up to a 
maximum value and then decreases exponentially. This tendency also occurs in the gearbox and 
generator, which is similar to the relatio nship between rpm and wind speed.  
Based on this result, the final step is to approximate the frequency  variation of the vibration signal 
at each rpm with the  Weibull distribution. Figure 6 b is an example simulating the distribu tion of RMS 
value from Figur e 6a. This approximation employs a statistical approach to the vibration distribution 
at a specific rpm of the main shaft.

3.3. Threshold Setting based on Alarm Level  
CMS of the wind turbine requires  vibration threshold s at each measuring point to judge the 
abnormality of mechanical systems such as main shaft, gearbox, and generator. In the previous 
studies [17,21]  and in Section  3.1 of this study, it was found that the distribution of vibration can be 
approximated by Weibull distribution although this varies with the mechanical system.  
Because the fault of a me chanical system can occur when the vibration signal is above a certain 
value, it seems to be statistically reasonable to apply the criterion based on a one -sided confidence 
interval of the probability distribution. If the data is normally distributed with mean, m and standard 
deviation, σ, the value of the cumulative distribution function ( cdf) up to m + σ is 84.1%; up to m + 2σ, 
97.7%; up to m + 3σ, 99.8%. This classification is based on the three sigma rule of the normal 
distribution. In this study, the vibration values corresponding to  the three values of the cdf of the 
Weibull distribution are used as thresholds for indicating the alarm level as shown in Table 2. For 
reference, the cdf of the Weibull distribution is defined as follows:  
𝑐𝑑𝑓(𝑥|𝑎,𝑏)=1−𝑒−(𝑥
𝑎)𝑏
, (3) 
wher e a is a scale factor and b a shape factor.  
Table 2.  Thresholds of vibration according to alarm level defined in this study. The cdf is the 
cumulative distribution function of Weibull distribution.

Warning  cdf(Tr)  = 99.8%  99.8% ≤ cdf(x)  
Figure 7 shows the vibration thresholds as a function of rpm obtained from the cdf of the Weibull 
distribution for variou s mechanical parts. In Figure  7b, the thresholds at 11 rpm are lower than those 
at 10 rpm. Due to the nature of mechanical system, if the system is safe from vibration at 10 rpm, 
there is no problem in the safety of the system even if the same vibration occurs at 11 rpm. To reflect 
this phenomenon, the thresholds are modified as applying the following condition:  
𝐼𝑓 𝑇𝑟@ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ−𝑟𝑝𝑚 ≤𝑇𝑟@𝑙𝑜𝑤 −𝑟𝑝𝑚,𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝑇𝑟@ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ−𝑟𝑝𝑚 =𝑇𝑟@𝑙𝑜𝑤 −𝑟𝑝𝑚. (4) 
Here, Tr is the threshold value at a specific rpm. Figure 8 shows the results modified from  
Figure 7 .

3.3. Threshold Setting based on Alarm Level
CMS of the wind turbine requires vibration thresholds at each measuring point to judge the
abnormality of mechanical systems such as main shaft, gearbox, and generator. In the previous
studies [ 17,21] and in Section 3.1 of this study, it was found that the distribution of vibration can be
approximated by Weibull distribution although this varies with the mechanical system.
Because the fault of a mechanical system can occur when the vibration signal is above a certain
value, it seems to be statistically reasonable to apply the criterion based on a one-sided conﬁdence
interval of the probability distribution. If the data is normally distributed with mean, mand standard
deviation, s, the value of the cumulative distribution function ( cdf) up to m +sis 84.1%; up to m + 2s,
97.7%; up to m +3s, 99.8%. This classiﬁcation is based on the three sigma rule of the normal distribution.
In this study, the vibration values corresponding to the three values of the cdfof the Weibull distribution
are used as thresholds for indicating the alarm level as shown in Table 2. For reference , the cdfof the
Weibull distribution is deﬁned as follows:
cd f(xja,b)=1 e (x

where ais a scale factor and ba shape factor.

Figure 7 shows the vibration thresholds as a function of rpm obtained from the cdfof the Weibull
distribution for various mechanical parts. In Figure 7b, the thresholds at 11 rpm are lower than those
at 10 rpm. Due to the nature of mechanical system, if the system is safe from vibration at 10 rpm, there
is no problem in the safety of the system even if the same vibration occurs at 11 rpm. To reﬂect this
phenomenon, the thresholds are modiﬁed as applying the following condition:
I f Tr @high rpmTr@low rpm,then Tr @high rpm=Tr@low rpm. (4)

4. Fault Monitoring Using Hidden Markov Model  
4.1. Fault Detection Algori thm 
CMS of the existing wind turbine produces  an alarm signal when the vibration obtained through 
a specific channel is higher than a predetermined threshold. However, this method has the 
disadvantage that one -off external impact signals and alarm errors m ay occur: (a) when the system 
starts or stops operating or (b) due to unexpected electrical noise. In fact, because abnormal 
symptoms occurring in mechanical system induces continuously increasing vibration, it is desirable 
to generate an alarm signal cons idering the excessive vibration and its duration simultaneously. To 
this end, a fault monitoring algorithm is proposed using HMM, one of the stochastic models.  
4.1.1. Hidden Markov Model (HMM)  
HMM has been widely used for the pattern classification or reco gnition such as speech, motion, 
and genes because of its excellent mathematical basis, high computational efficiency, and efficient 
modeling tool for a sequence with temporal constraints [15,22] . Recently, it has also been applied to 
engineering problems l ike fault recognition of mechanical systems. HMM has the distinct advantage 
of easy extension to the types of events to be classified or the types of recognizable faults. If the target 
signal is a one -dimensional sequence such as vibration and acoustic sig nal, its recognition 
performance is further improved [23].  
HMM is characterized by four model parameters: the number of states, the number of distinct 
observation symbols per state, state transition probability distribution T=[𝑎𝑖𝑗], and observation 
symbol probability distribution E=[𝑏𝑝𝑞] [15], as shown in Figure 9. There are three basic problems 
of interest that should be solved for the model to be useful in real -world applications. One is the 
evaluation problem that is to quantify how well a given model matches a given observation sequence 
representing a specific event. Another is the decoding problem, which is the uncovering of the hidden 
part of the model; in other words, the goal is to find the state sequence relat ed to the series of events.

probability and bpq is the observation symbol probability.  
4.1.2. Design of HMMs for Fault Detection  
Structure and Input data  
The states of HMM can be divided as follows: normal  and fault because the operating conditio ns 
of the wind turbine can be  normal or not. If one assumes that the same result s can be observed even 
if their occurrence probabilities at each state are different from  one another, a HMM having a two -
state fully connected structure shown in Figure 9 can be utilized for this study.  
An observation sequence for the training of HMM is obtained through the process shown in 
Figure 10; this is an example of the bearing of the main shaft. First, vibrations at a specific time are 
compared with the thresholds as a  function of rpm defined in Section  3.2 and then the operation at 
the moment is divided into 4 alarm levels: normal, attention, caution, and warning which are 
assigned the numbers: ‘0’, ‘1’, ‘2’, and ‘3’, respectively. With this method, vibration signals o f 
individual channels are converted to the form of a number sequence indicating alarm level.  
Next, all channels used for measuring the vibrations of the specific mechanical part are 
simultaneously considered to prevent a false alarm that occurs due to une xpected electric noise on a 
particular channel [24]. In fact, the vibrations correlate with each other, even if they are measured in 
different directions. For the bearing of main shaft, the correlation between RMS values of vibration 
in the x -, y-, z-direc tion is high. For the gearbox, the correlation between HFBP values in y - and z -
directions of low and high speed parts is also high. For the generator, the correlation between HFBP 
values in y - and z -direction of input and output parts is high [17].  
To thi s end, the number sequence of individual channel are added according to the time. Because 
three channels are applied in the case of the bearing of the main shaft, the maximum and minimum 
numbers are 9 and 0, respectively. Here, ‘9’ means that at that time,  all vibrations in the x -, y-, z-
directions are on warning level and ‘0’ does that they are normal.  
Finally, the assignments of the symbols indicating the operating state at that time as introducing 
four indicators are as follows: ‘N‘ if the added number is 0, ‘A’ between 1  and 3, ‘C’ between 4  and 6, 
and ‘W’ between 7  and 9. The indicators are used as the observations of HMM.

simultaneously considered to prevent a false alarm that occurs due to unexpected electric noise
on a particular channel [ 24]. In fact, the vibrations correlate with each other, even if they are measured
in different directions. For the bearing of main shaft, the correlation between RMS values of vibration
in the x-, y-, z-direction is high. For the gearbox, the correlation between HFBP values in y- and
z-directions of low and high speed parts is also high. For the generator, the correlation between HFBP
values in y- and z-direction of input and output parts is high [17].

the mechanical part. To know whether a mechanical part is abnormal or not, a test sequence of
the considered time interval obtained by the process of Figure 10 is applied to the HMMs and then
probabilities representing the degree of correspondence with each HMM are calculated. This is the
evaluation problem of the HMM [ 15]. The probabilities are compared with each other and then the
HMM having the high probability is selected as the model expressing the situation of the time interval.
That is, if HMM related to an abnormal state that has a high probability, it means that the mechanical
system is abnormal.

4.2. Performance of the Proposed Algorithm
To evaluate the performance of the fault detection algorithm using HMM, all vibration signals are
transformed into a sequence indicating operating state. A test sequence consists of 100 indicators and
its duration is 100 s. Test sequences for abnormal state includes more than 15 indicators ‘C’ or ‘W’ and
for normal state, lower than 5.
Table 5 shows the number of test sequences used for a performance check on each mechanical
part. Sequences used in HMM training are not included in the test sequence. The number of test
sequences for an abnormal state is less than for the normal state because there are few caution and
warning states during wind turbine operation. For this, some metrics for measuring the performance
used for the binary classiﬁcation problem with imbalanced dataset are introduced as shown in Table 6.
Accuracy is the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of test sequences. TPrate
and recall are the number of correct abnormal predictions divided by the number of test sequences
predicted as ‘abnormal’. FPrate is the number of wrong normal predictions divided by the number of
test sequences predicted as ‘normal’. Precision is the number of correct abnormal predictions divided
by the number of test sequences for ‘abnormal’. F-measure is deﬁned as follows:
F measure =2RecallPrecision
Recall +Precision. (4)
All metrics except FPrate show high performance when they have high values. On the other hand,
small value of FPrate means high performance [26,27].
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Sensors 2018 ,18, 1790 13 of 15
In Table 6, judging from the FPrate and precision , all test sequences for abnormal state are perfectly
indicated as ‘abnormal’. High accuracy (more than 0.96) means that prediction using the suggested
HMMs has very low error. For the generator, however, TPrate is 0.573 because the number of test
sequences of abnormal state of the generator is only 4.4% of the number of test sequences of its normal
state. It is expected to improve as the number of test sequences of abnormal state increases. As a result,
these measures mean that detection performance using the suggested HMMs is good.

 In Table 6, ju dging from the FPrate  and precision , all test sequences for abnormal state are 
perfectly indicated as ‘abnormal’. High accuracy  (more than 0.96 ) means that prediction using the 
suggested HMMs has very low error. For the generator, however, TPrate  is 0.573 because the number 
of test sequences of abnormal state of the generator is only 4.4% of the number of test sequences of 
its normal state. It is expected to improve as the number of test sequences of abnormal state increases.  
As a result, these measures mea n that detection performance using the suggested HMMs is good.

This includes the vibration signals of x-, y-, and z- directions measured at the bearing of the main
shaft and the thresholds related to a caution alarm. The threshold value changes as a function of the
rpm of the main shaft, as mentioned in Section 3.2. Figure 12a shows an example of abnormal data.
Some vibrations over the threshold value of caution appear in the x- and z- directions. That is the
moment that the revolution of main shaft changes from 10 rpm up to 14 rpm and power is generated.
In Figure 12b, which represents a normal condition, all vibrations are below the unchanged threshold
because the rotational speed is constant at 8 rpm. Judging from the results, it can be concluded that
it is possible to detect the time domain in which the abnormality occurs by applying the proposed
algorithm which includes HMM.
5. Conclusions
This study proposed a fault detection algorithm using HMM to recognize whether mechanical
parts of a wind turbine are behaving abnormally or not. A vibration signal was selected to determine
the status of the wind turbine and acceleration signals were measured at the bearing of the main shaft,
gearbox, and generator for more than 2 years. It was found that the distribution of the long-term
vibrations could be approximated with the Weibull probability density function when the vibrations
were classiﬁed by the rotational speed of main shaft. And then, the probability function was used to
determine the threshold values indicating alarm levels.
The input sequence for HMM was obtained by applying the threshold levels and the correlation
between the vibration signals. Because HMM took into account the variation of the status during the
a given time interval, it could overcome the disadvantage that the conventional methods exhibited,
alarm errors due to one-off external impact signals due to either system starts or stops or unexpected
electrical noise at a speciﬁc channel. As a result, it was found that the proposed HMM algorithm
for fault detection achieved 96% accuracy, 0%FPrate , and 100% precision by analyzing the long-term
vibration signals.
In fact, it is not easy to obtain the vibration data that is directly related to the fault since there
are very few actual fault events in the mechanical parts of the wind turbine. To overcome this, it will
be necessary to improve the statistical reliability of the proposed HMM by adjusting the threshold
level during continuous data acquisitions and re-training the transient probability distribution and the
observation symbol probability distribution. In addition, as further works, the number of detectable
states can be subdivided as using the advantage of HMM that can freely expand the number of classes
and the performance needs to be compared with the results obtained from other classiﬁcation methods.
