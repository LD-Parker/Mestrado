Abstract: Operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, and associated uncertainty, for wind turbines
(WTs) is a signiÔ¨Åcant burden for wind farm operators. Many wind turbine failures are unpredictable
while causing loss of energy production, and may also cause loss of asset. This study utilized
753 O&M event data from 21 wind turbines operating in Germany, to improve the prediction of
failure frequency and associated costs. We applied Bayesian updating to predict wind turbine failure
frequency and time-to-repair (TTR), in conjunction to machine learning techniques for assessing
costs associated with failures. We found that time-to-failure (TTF), time-to-repair and the cost of
failures depend on operational and environmental conditions. High elevation ( >100 m) of the wind
turbine installation was found to increase both the probability of failures and probability of delayed
repairs. Furthermore, it was determined that direct-drive turbines are more favorable at locations
with high capacity factor (more than 40%) whereas geared-drive turbines show lower failure costs
than direct-drive ones at temperate-coastal locations with medium capacity factors (between 20% and
40%). Based on these Ô¨Åndings, we developed a decision support tool that can guide a site-speciÔ¨Åc
selection of wind turbine types, while providing a thorough estimation of O&M budgets.

1. Introduction
Operation and maintenance (O&M) of wind turbines (WTs) can be a burden to wind farm operators.
Many failures of wind turbines are unpredictable, and the uncertainty presents risks of loss of energy
production, loss of asset and lacking O&M monetary budget. Mone et al. (2017) [ 1] determined O&M
cost of wind turbines as high as $14.6 /MWh for a 2 MW onshore wind turbine in a 200 MW-project,
and $49.6 /MWh for a 4.14 MW o shore wind turbine in a 600 MW-project. The corresponding total,
during a 20 years-lifetime, O&M costs were around 2$M and 14.8$M for the onshore and the o shore
wind turbine, respectively [ 1]. This was in addition to the cost for lost energy production during the
failure and maintenance periods. Proactive maintenance is expected to decrease downtime and the
cost of failure but the extent and frequency of needed maintenance is debatable [2,3].
There are several studies in the literature on wind turbine reliability prediction and maintenance
optimization. Faultsich et al. (2011) [ 4] studied topographical and environmental factors causing
wind turbine failures and concluded that turbines close to seawater and at high land locations (the
elevation is not speciÔ¨Åed) with high wind speed su er the highest failure rates. Wilson and McMillan
(2014) [ 5] assessed wind farm reliability but they only used weather dependent failure rates. Slimacek
and Lindqvist (2016) [ 6] applied Poisson and survival analyses to analyze wind turbine failure
frequencies accounting for type and size of turbines, harshness of environment, time from installation,
and seasonal e ects. They found that lightning, icing and high wind increased the failure rate by

1.7 times. Consequently, Reder et al. (2018) [ 7] proposed a framework consisting of data mining
and k-means clustering techniques, to determine the e ects of weather conditions on wind turbine
failures by analyzing Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data. Contrary to Slimacek
and Lindqvist, they found that wind speed did not impact failure occurrences; they also reported
that failure frequencies were increased in the winter. Reder and Melero (2018) [ 8] proposed using
Bayes Belief Networks (BBN) to predict wind turbine failures based on weather conditions. They have
utilized failure data from 948 wind turbines operating during 87 wind turbine-years, and concluded
that BBN is capable of reliably predicting wind turbine failures. However, their study was limited to
1.1 month of operation per turbine on average and lacked maintenance cost prediction.
Regarding the cost and beneÔ¨Åt of preventive maintenance, Besnard (2009) [ 2] estimated that
employing a condition monitoring system would result to savings of 190,000 ¬øfor a 3 MW wind turbine.
They also determined the optimal interval for visual inspection to be four months and for blades to be
one year. Ortegon et al. (2014) [ 3] investigated typical failure rates and maintenance cost to evaluate the
cost-beneÔ¨Åt of applying preventive maintenance. They determined that corrective maintenance would
cost $511,596 if there is no preventive maintenance, whereas the total O&M cost would be $77,542
if there are two preventive maintenance events per year per turbine in its entire life using average
failure probability values from various O&M databases. Leigh and Dunnett (2016) [ 9] developed a
mathematical model for the maintenance of wind turbines considering three types of maintenance,
namely periodic, conditional and corrective for an o shore 5 MW turbine. The model evaluated
the number of corrective maintenances required for a lifetime of the turbine for every subsystem [ 9].
Carlos et al. (2013) [ 10] applied Monte Carlo simulations for maintenance optimization purposes
using generic failure database and wind speed data from a Spanish database. They concluded that the
optimum scheduled maintenance interval should be 113 days instead of a typical industry schedule of
180 days, whereas Kerres et al. (2014) [ 11] found that corrective maintenance done upon a failure, is a
better option for a V44-600 kW turbine. Raza and Ulansky (2019) [ 12] applied imperfect continuous
condition monitoring which considers correct and incorrect decisions about preventive maintenance
for wind turbines. They concluded that a preventive maintenance could reduce the average lifetime
maintenance cost 11.8 times comparing the corrective maintenance for wind turbine blades.
Overall, several of the previous studies diverse in their Ô¨Åndings and new approaches to data
analysis and modeling may be needed to provide more cohesive guidance to wind turbine O&M
managers. In an e ort to better elucidate O&M risks and burdens, we recently investigated the impact of
climatic region and turbine gear type by using Failure Modes E ects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA)
and found that colder climates have more e ect on some subsystems and parts (e.g., blade shells)
while turbine gear type mainly impact the frequency and repair time of subsystems and parts [ 13].
Subsequently, we assessed risk factors for wind turbine reliability applying survival analysis [ 14].
Our previous Ô¨Åndings show that scheduled maintenance can increase the survival of a wind turbine
system and electrical subsystems up to 2.8 and 3.8 times, respectively. The current study uses the risk
factors determined in [ 13,14] to improve the prediction of the frequency of wind turbine failures and
associated repair times Bayesian updating. In addition, we employ machine learning techniques on
the risk factors, to assess wind turbine failure costs [13,14].
Bayesian updating has not been used before in probabilistic assessments of time-to-failure (TTF)
and time-to-repair (TTR) and machine learning techniques were not used previously in determining
costs of failures for wind turbines although they were used for component condition monitoring [ 15‚Äì17]
and for other applications [ 18‚Äì21]. The major contributions of this paper are two-fold: (1) Bayesian
updating is used at the Ô¨Årst time in probabilistic assessments of time-to-failure and time-to-repair of
wind turbines. (2) It is a novel use of machine learning applications to estimate cost of wind turbine
failures using operational and environmental conditions.
Predicting time-to-failure, time-to-repair and cost of failures should o er valuable guidance to the
wind turbine industry. Thus, the goal of this study is two-fold. Firstly, to evaluate time-to-failure (TTF)
probabilities for every month of operation and estimating time-to-repair (TTR) probabilities for TTR 

8 h, 8 h <TTR16 h, 16 h <TTR24 h, and more than 1-day time intervals based on operational
and environmental conditions using Bayesian updating. Secondly, to develop a decision support tool
for estimating cost of failures of wind turbines from operational and environmental conditions in a
German database, using machine learning techniques. The decision support tool can be utilized by
wind farm investors for site and turbine type selection and for wind farm operators for allocating
O&M budgets and evaluating the cost and beneÔ¨Åt of O&M services o ered by third parties.
This paper contains six sections covering the following:

prediction and modeling; maintenance optimization and cost and beneÔ¨Åt of preventive
maintenance. The goal of the paper is also stated in the Ô¨Årst section.

machine learning techniques.

2. Data and Selected Variables
2.1. Reliability Data
The Wind Monitor and Evaluation Program (WMEP) database, which is utilized as reliability
data in this study, is a comprehensive maintenance database covering 19 years (1989 to 2008) of wind
turbine operations in Germany [ 4]; unfortunately, this database has not been extended to recent years.
Twenty-one wind turbines with capacities of 500 kW, 600 kW and 1500 kW are selected as representative
of two di erent designs, namely geared and direct-drive turbines. Thirteen turbines have 500 kW,
2 turbines have 600 kW and 6 turbines have 1500 kW capacities. In this study the turbines are surveyed
for all their maintenance activities, and this created 753 O&M data points.
The aim of this study is to identify and evaluate methodologies for predicting wind turbine failure
frequency, time-to-repair and cost of repair. The only detailed data available to us for illustrating the
considered methodologies covered the period 1989‚Äì2008. Considering the evolution of wind turbines
in recent years, the results from these data may not be applicable to current wind turbines. However,
data descriptive of newer types can be used in the methodologies we presented to derive more up to
date results.
2.1.1. Selected Variables
Six independent variables are selected for determining factors a ecting wind turbine reliability.
These variables are in two main categories which consist of operational and environmental conditions.
Operational factors include turbine design type, number of previous failures (NOPF) and capacity
factors (CF), whereas environmental factors include geography, mean annual wind speed (MAWS) and
climatic regions of turbine locations.
2.1.2. Operational Variables
Turbine design type: There are two operational designs represented in the WMEP database; these
are of geared-drive and electrically induced direct-drive turbines.
Number of previous failures (NOPF): Operation cases are distinguished in low (0‚Äì20) and
high-number of previous failures (21‚Äìmore) there is a clear distinction between time-to-failure values
of two cases of turbines with less than or equal to 20 and more than 20 failures.
Capacity factor (CF): Wind turbine operation cases are divided into three categories; low (20% >
CF), medium (20 CF40%) and high (40% CF) capacity factors.

2.1.3. Environmental Variables
Geography: Geographical regions are categorized as coastal, high inland and low inland [ 4].
Coastal turbine operations take place within 20 km of coastal region and less than or equal to 100 m
elevation from sea level, high inland turbine operations take place at locations with elevation of more
than 100 m from sea level, with the rest of turbine operations classiÔ¨Åed as low inland turbine operations.
Mean Annual Wind Speed (MAWS): Turbine operations are classiÔ¨Åed into low level ( <6.25 m /s)
and high level (6.25 m /s) based on the values from global wind atlas [ 22]; these wind speed levels
correspond to the hub height of the wind turbines.
Climatic region: Koppen-Geiger climatic regions are utilized for climate classiÔ¨Åcation [ 13].
Germany includes temperate and cold Koppen-Geiger climatic regions. For the cold climatic region,
average temperature of the coldest month is less than or equal to 0C whereas for the temperate
climatic region, average temperature of the coldest month is between 0C and 18C [23].
In this study we have employed environmental variables with long term e ects aiming to
develop models for predicting monthly or annual wind turbine operation. However, additional
higher-resolution environmental data could be used in the outlined methodology in order to derive
short term failure prediction models.
The number of data and their share in the considered categories of variables are shown in Table 1.

3. Methodology
Two approaches were applied to determine wind turbine frequencies of failure and associated
times to repair; namely Bayesian updating and machine learning. A Bayesian updating is used to
predict discrete time-to-failure and time-to-repair probabilities for wind turbines based on their known
operational and environmental parameters. Cost of failures are predicted from the probabilities of
time-time-to-failure and of time-to-repair which are derived by machine learning methods. These
methods included logistic regression, artiÔ¨Åcial neural network, k-nearest neighbor and support vector
machine learning.
3.1. Turbine-Based Failure Frequency and Time-to-Repair Prediction
3.1.1. Bayes Theorem
The Bayes theorem is Ô¨Årst introduced by Thomas Bayes in 1950s and has been used in various
applications. In statistics, the Bayesian approach is used to utilize prior knowledge and data from
current experiment ( x) to obtain posterior distribution of unknown parameter [18]. An important
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2020 ,13, 1149 5 of 25
advantage of Bayesian inference is that it enables to update the probability of a failure when more
data are available [ 19]. Let P( ) represents the prior distribution of and let L( x,) denote the
likelihood function and P( |x) is posterior distribution then Bayes theorem can be expressed as in the
Equation (1) [18]:
P(jx) =L(x,)P()R1
 1L(x,)P()d(1)
3.1.2. Likelihood Function
For observed data, x, the function L( x,)=f(x|) which is considered as a function of is called as
likelihood function. Given a set of observed data x1,x2,x3,: : :,xnwhich represent a random sample
from a population of Xwith principal density fx(X), the probability of observing this set of variables
assuming that the parameter of the distribution is , is given in Equation (2) [18].
L(x,) =Yn
i=1fx(xij) (2)
3.1.3. Prior Knowledge
In Bayesian approach, prior knowledge comes from historical data, prior beliefs or previous work.
A prior distribution, P( ), which is so-called conjugate prior simpliÔ¨Åes the application of Bayes theorem
for obtaining posterior distribution. For instance, the class of normal densities is a conjugate family for
normal priors which can be used for obtaining posterior density of given xis normal [21].
3.1.4. Posterior Distribution
Posterior distribution, P( |x), is calculated by Equation (1) and represents combination of beliefs
from the prior knowledge about and beliefs which come from observed sample data x[19].
3.1.5. Beta Distribution
In probability theory and statistics beta distribution is used for binomial distributions which
include discrete data. Since we consider discrete number of turbine-failures for time-to-failure and
time-to-repair we use beta distribution for prior and posterior distributions in this study. Beta
distribution has two parameters, namely andwhich control the shape of the distribution [ 24].
A Keisan-Casio online calculator is utilized for posterior beta distribution calculations [25].
3.1.6. Bayesian Updating
Generic scheduled maintenance interval for wind turbines in the industry is every three months
for the Ô¨Årst year of operation and after that every six months or every year depending on the turbine
type [ 3]. To capture these schedules, we examined the failure probabilities on a monthly basis.
Estimated probabilities of failure for the Ô¨Årst seven months of operation at high inland locations of
direct-drive wind turbines, are shown in Table 2. There were 238 wind turbine-failures in total, of which
173 occurred over the course of the Ô¨Årst month of operation. A uniform distribution was assumed for
prior knowledge, since there were not prior monthly-based failure data. Therefore, alpha and beta
values are added to 174 and 66, respectively which gives a 73% probability by using beta distribution
mode value (Beta (174, 66)) [ 15]. This calculation is repeated for the rest of the months in a similar way.
TTR probabilities are estimated by the same approach, considering time-to-repair intervals of TTR 
8 h, 8 h <TTR16 h, 16 h <TTR24 h, and longer than 1-day. The rationale behind these intervals is
that maintenance work shifts are mostly allotted for eight hours in the wind industry.
3.2. Predicting Cost of Failures
To predict the cost of failures, time-to-failure and time-to-repair, probabilities are evaluated for
every combination of operational and environmental conditions by using machine learning methods;
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2020 ,13, 1149 6 of 25
subsequently, the results are multiplied by the cost of failure for each capacity factor. Time-to-failure
probabilities are estimated based on the classes of less than 60-days of operation and more than
60-days of operation since the mean value of time-to-failure of all operations is 60 days. Time-to-repair
probability classes are TTR 8 h, 8 h <TTR16 h, 16 h <TTR24 h, and more than 1-day. Figure 1
shows a schematic illustration of a machine learning method while Figure 2 shows the schematic of
developing the decision support tool.

3.2.1. Machine Learning Methods
Four machine learning methods namely logistic regression (LR), artiÔ¨Åcial neural network (ANN),
k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and support vector machines (SVM) are used in this study. Machine
learning methods are applied to determine the output probabilities based on input variables. The
input parameters are operational and environmental variables which are given in Table 1. Output
values are probability of having a failure within 60 days of operation and time-to-repair probabilities
based on the time intervals which are TTR 8 h, 8 h <TTR16 h, 16 h <TTR24 h.
3.2.2. Logistic Regression (LR)
Logistic regression is a machine learning method which examines relationship between some input
parameters and outcomes [ 26]. In this study, input parameters are operational and environmental
variables while outcomes are failing or non-failing within 60 days of operation and time-to-repair
intervals. The procedure for best fitting is done by applying several iterations until the outcome prediction
ability is maximized. The mathematical expression of logistic regression is give in Equation (3).
Log (p
1 p) = B0+B1X1+ : : :+BnXn (3)
where B0is a constant B1,B2,: : :,Bnare regression coe cients of the variables X1,X2,: : :,Xn.
Therefore, probability of Xcan be calculated as in Equation (4):
P(X) =eB0+B1X1++BnXn
1+eB0+B1X1++BnXn(4)
Logistic regression (LR) uses maximum likelihood method to produce a best-Ô¨Åtting function to
the data [ 18]. The procedure for best Ô¨Åtting is applied by several iterations to maximize the probability
of the observed data to be part of the correct classiÔ¨Åed outcome given the regression coe cients.
3.2.3. ArtiÔ¨Åcial Neural Networks (ANN)
The ArtiÔ¨Åcial Neural Network (ANN) is a machine learning technique to model complex problems
and predict outcomes utilizing collected data and independent variables [ 26]. The method mimics the
learning and recalling behavior of human brain which consists of massive number of neurons [ 24].
Neurons in ANN are fully connected within three di erent layers, namely input layer, hidden layers
and output layer as illustrated in Figure 1 [26].

mimics the learning and recalling behavior of hu man brain which consists of massive number of 
neurons [24]. Neurons in ANN are fully connected within three different layers, namely input layer, 
hidden layers and output layer as illustrated in Figure 1 [26]. 
 
Figure 1. Feed-forward multilayer neural network [26. 
Input layer has all information from the input pa ttern whereas hidden layer connects the input 
layer to the output layer by an activation function  and the outcome layer transforms the hidden layer 
activation into the scale of desired output. The most  widely used neural network which is multi-layer 
feed forward (MLF) with back propagation learning is  used in this study. The activation function is 
selected as hyperbolic tangent because of its differ entiable nature and use of classification purpose. 
The neural networks algorithm repeats feed-forwarding and back propagating until it minimizes the outcome error [26]. 
3.2.4 K-nearest Neighbor (KNN) 
K-nearest neighbor (KNN) is a simple and wi dely used machine learning technique. The 
algorithm classifies an unknown object based on the highest vote of classes from k number of 
neighbors [27]. The training proces s aims to maximize the prediction  accuracy for all data points 
training with different number of k‚Äôs. The st eps in the KNN algorithm are as follows [28]: 
‚Ä¢ 1st step: Calculating the distances from all data point to the data point of interest. 
‚Ä¢ 2nd step: Ranking all the distances.  
‚Ä¢ 3rd step: Determining the optimal k value by training the data set until it reaches the 
maximum prediction accuracy.  
‚Ä¢ 4th step: Classifying the unknown data point by using the optimal k nearest neighbor 
number. 
In a KNN algorithm a data point is classified ba sed on their neighbors where the algorithm finds 
the nearest neighbor which maximizes the ef ficiency while minimizing the error [27]. 
3.2.5 Support Vector Machines (SVM) 
Support vector machine (SVM) is a machine learning method which classifies data points using 
hyperplanes [29]. In support vector machines, every data point is considered as p dimensional vector which consists of a list of p values and SVM finds the linear hyperplane to classify data points based 
on a selected function [29]. The SVM algorithm tries to maximize the distance between the classes by 
drawing hyperplanes. Support vectors are the closest data points from the cla sses to the hyperplanes. 
Kernel functions provide separation boundaries be tween classes. There are different kernel options 
such as linear, radial basis functi on (Gaussian), polynomial and sigm oid [29]. All kernel options must 
be tried to obtain maximum prediction accuracy.

Input layer has all information from the input pattern whereas hidden layer connects the input

selected as hyperbolic tangent because of its di erentiable nature and use of classiÔ¨Åcation purpose.
The neural networks algorithm repeats feed-forwarding and back propagating until it minimizes the
outcome error [26].
3.2.4. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
K-nearest neighbor (KNN) is a simple and widely used machine learning technique. The algorithm
classiÔ¨Åes an unknown object based on the highest vote of classes from k number of neighbors [ 27]. The
training process aims to maximize the prediction accuracy for all data points training with di erent
number of k‚Äôs. The steps in the KNN algorithm are as follows [28]:

 3rd step: Determining the optimal k value by training the data set until it reaches the maximum
prediction accuracy.
 4th step: Classifying the unknown data point by using the optimal k nearest neighbor number.
In a KNN algorithm a data point is classiÔ¨Åed based on their neighbors where the algorithm Ô¨Ånds
the nearest neighbor which maximizes the e ciency while minimizing the error [27].
3.2.5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Support vector machine (SVM) is a machine learning method which classiÔ¨Åes data points using
hyperplanes [ 29]. In support vector machines, every data point is considered as p dimensional vector
which consists of a list of p values and SVM Ô¨Ånds the linear hyperplane to classify data points based

3.2.6. K-Fold Cross Validation
Cross validation is applied on the data to determine performances of machine learning methods.
Generally, cross-validation for machine learning techniques is done by splitting data into ten pieces.
Nine pieces are used for training and one piece is used for test for every fold of cross validation.
10-fold cross validation is applied by repeating the process until every piece of ten becomes a test case.
Cross-validation is done using Orange machine learning software [30].

An example of cost of failure prediction is gi ven for a direct-drive wind turbine operating at 
high capacity factor (50%), present at temperate coastal, high mean annual wind speed location and 
having 10 previous failures as in the following: 
i. Calculating time-to-failure and time-to-repair probabilities for all condition combinations. 
In order to calculate probabilities of time-to-failure (TTF) and time-to-repair (TTR), a machine 
learning method is adopted. Two different machine learning applications are used to obtain time-to-failure and time-to-repair probabilities, and 10-f old cross validation is applied to evaluate the

As an example; probability of failure in less than or equal to 60 days and time-to-repair probability
classes are given for direct drive-high CF-coastal-temperate-high MAWS and low NOPF combination
in Table 3. As shown in Table 3, the probability of failure within 60 days of operation is 82% which is
considerably high for a direct-drive turbine operating at high capacity, located at coastal, temperate
and high MAWS location and having less than 20 failure history. We also see that 84% of the failures
are repaired within 16 h, which is a relatively short downtime.

ii.Assuming cost of failures for time-to-repair classes.
The cost of failures is estimated by considering the cost of repair and the cost of lost energy
production per MW capacity of a wind turbine. The cost of failure values used in this study were
derived from sample break downs of reported annual cost values [ 31]. The end-users can use their
own cost of repair values based on their experience and judgement. The assumed costs of wind turbine
failures are given in Table 4 for three energy production levels.

iii.Multiplying probability of being frequently-failing with the cost for time-to-repair classes.
Cost of failures are calculated for every class of time-to-repair (e.g., 0‚Äì8 h) by multiplying the
probability of being associated with high frequently failing and cost of failures. For example, the failure
frequently of a direct-drive wind turbine operating with a 50% capacity factor (at temperate coastal
and high mean annual wind speed location, and having 10 previous failures, is 82% (Table 3). Cost of
0‚Äì8 h repair for turbine in these conditions is assumed as $2000. The probability of having 0‚Äì8 h repair
for given wind turbine is 71% as shown Table 3. The associated cost is calculated by Equations (5) and
(6). Equation (5) is the base for calculations of proposed decision support tool.
C (T) =Probability of failure Cost of failureProbability of time-to-repair (5)
C (0-8 h) =0.822000 ($)0.71=$1164 (6)
iv.Summing all cost shares for time-to-repair classes for a given condition.
Total probabilistic cost of failures for 60-days of operation for wind turbines are calculated
by summing Ô¨Åve classes of time-to-repair. Costs for 0‚Äì8 h, 8‚Äì16 h, 16‚Äì24 h and more than 1-day
time-to-repair divisions along with total estimated cost for a direct-drive wind turbine operating at
high capacity factor (50%), present at coastal, high mean annual wind speed location and having 10
previous failures is given in Table 5.

Time-to-failure and time-to-repair probabilities are explained in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, respectively.
Cost of failure prediction results are explained in Section 5.3.
5.1. Time-to-Failure Probabilities by Bayesian Updating
Failure probabilities for every month of operation are estimated by using Bayesian updating; results
are shown in Figure 3. Failure probabilities vary depending on the operational and environmental
condition of wind turbines. Figure 3a shows that geared-drive turbines with medium capacity factor
have the lowest probability of failures for most of the time, while direct-drive turbines with high capacity
factor have the highest probabilities of failures. Geared-drive turbines at low inland locations have
the lowest probability of failure while direct-drive high inland turbines have the highest probability
of failures as can be seen in Figure 3b. In the Ô¨Årst three month of operation only 40% of the failures
occurred for low inland geared-drive turbines while 95% of the failures occurred for direct-drive high
inland turbines. Figure 3c shows that geared-drive wind turbines at high MAWS locations have the
lowest probability of failures whereas direct-drive turbines regardless of their mean annual wind speed
they have the highest probability of failures at every month of operation. Geared-drive wind turbines
with low number of previous failures have the lowest probability of failures whereas direct-drive
turbines with high number of failures have the highest probability of failures as seen in Figure 3d.
It is seen on Figure 3e that geared-drive at temperate climates have the lowest probability of failure
comparing to direct-drive turbines in both temperate and cold regions. It is also seen from Figure 3e
that direct-drive turbines in cold climatic regions have higher probability of failures comparing to
the ones in temperate-climates. Overall, direct drive wind turbines with high capacity factor at high
inland, high mean annual wind speed at cold regions with high number of previous failures have a
greater monthly probability of failures.

design type and other environmental and operationa l conditions. Figure 4a shows the results of time-
to-repair probabilities as a function of wind turbine capacity factors of. From these results, it is inferred that direct-drive turbines with high capa city factor have the highest probability of quick 
repairs and the lowest probability of delayed repairs, whereas geared-drive turbines with medium 
capacity factor have the lowest probability of quick repairs and highest probability of delayed repairs. It is also shown in Figure 4a that geared-drive turbines with high capacity factor have the highest probability of quick repairs in geared-drive turbines . Figure 4b shows that direct-drive turbines at 
low inland locations have the lowest probability of delayed repairs such that 96% of the failures are repaired in less than one day. On the other hand, geared-drive turbines at high inland locations have 
the highest probability of delayed repairs such that 42% of the failures is repaired in more than one 
day. Figure 4c shows that there is not a common pattern for TTR probabilities of different design t y p e s  o f  w i n d  t u r b i n e s  b a s e d  o n  m e a n  a n n u a l  w i n d  s p e e d .

It is also shown in Figure 4a that geared-drive turbines with high capacity factor have the highest
probability of quick repairs in geared-drive turbines. Figure 4b shows that direct-drive turbines at

types of wind turbines based on mean annual wind speed. Direct-drive turbines at low MAWS
locations have the highest probability of quick repairs and lowest probability of delayed repairs,
contrarily, geared-drive turbines at low MAWS locations have the highest probability of delayed repairs

change the share of probability of TTR values signiÔ¨Åcantly for direct-drive wind turbines. However,

whereas geared-drive turbines which have more than 20-failures history have 65% of time-to-repair
in more than 8 h. It is observed from Figure 4e that there is a slight impact of temperate climate on
time-to-repair for direct-drive turbines. In temperate climates, direct-drive wind turbines have lower
share of quick repairs and higher share of delayed repairs comparing to cold climates. Since there is
no data from cold climates for geared-drive wind turbines the only comparison can be done against
direct-drive wind turbines at temperate locations. It is seen from Figure 4e that geared-drive turbines in
temperate climate have lower share of quick repairs and higher share of delayed repairs comparing to
the direct-drive turbines at cold climates. Overall, geared-drive wind turbines with low capacity factor

5.3. Predicting Cost of Failures
As discussed in Section 3, we used machine learning methods to predict times-to-failure (TTF)
and times-to-repair (TTR). Table 6 shows the TTF and TTR prediction accuracies obtained via machine
learning from four methods, based on 10-fold cross validation.
Table 6. Comparison of prediction accuracies.
Method Output Prediction Accuracy Overall Prediction Accuracy
LRTTF 0.7440.694TTR 0.643
ANNTTF 0.7420.697TTR 0.652
KNNTTF 0.7330.687TTR 0.641
SVMTTF 0.7410.686TTR 0.631
A 10-fold cross validation showed that ANN has 74.2% prediction accuracy with a single
hidden layer and eight neurons for TTF and 65.2% prediction accuracy for TTR classiÔ¨Åcations with a
single hidden layer and nine neurons; these are deemed to be satisfactorily accurate [ 11]. For KNN
applications, parameters are used as k =100 and weighted distance with Euclidian distances. Since
ANN is determined as giving the greatest overall accuracy, thus 69.7%, among all four techniques, TTF
and TTR prediction results from ANN are integrated to predict wind turbine cost of failures depending
on their operational and environmental conditions of wind turbines. All machine learning applications
are done in an Orange machine learning toolbox [ 30]. The TTF and TTR probability matrices from
the considered ANN models are presented in Appendix A. The following sections explain the results
based on three di erent capacity factors.
5.3.1. Low Capacity Factor
Figure 5 shows that geared-drive wind turbines operating at low capacity, have higher estimated
costs at high inland locations than direct-drive turbines which operate at a low capacity factor. The
highest distinction between the two types of turbines is noted at the high inland locations with low
mean average wind speed (MAWS) regardless of their number of previous failures and climatic regions.
This can be attributed to the increased numbers of start-stop events at low capacity factors as well as the
potential increase of gust and time-to-access to the site for maintenance. In other words, geared-drive
turbines would tend to have failures that result to more costs than direct-drive turbines Although there
is no combination of factors that make geared-drive wind turbines more favorable, it is noted that
temperate locations with coastal and low inland geography are the locations with the least distinction
of cost of failure between direct-drive and geared-drive wind turbines. Overall, cold weather and high
inland locations with higher MAWS direct-drive turbines exhibit lower repair-associated costs, whereas
at temperate and coastal or low inland locations with lower MAWS geared-drive wind turbines are
more favorable considering higher initial cost of direct-drive wind turbines.

5.3.2. Medium Capacity Factor 
Figure 6 shows that at medium capacity factor locations the distinction between direct-drive and 
geared-drive turbines become closer. This can be a ttributed to the lower number of start-stop times 
where geared-drive turbines remain active with a medium energy production level comparing to the low-capacity factor areas. In other words, the wear and tear potential due to start-stop is reduced for 
geared-drive turbines at medium capacity factor in comparison with low-capacity factor locations. The highest distinction between the two types of wind  turbines is noticed at high inland locations

MAWS regardless of number of previous failures with medium capacity factor. Overall, temperate
and low inland or coastal locations are the most favorable locations for a geared-drive wind turbine
considering higher initial cost of direct-drive wind turbines comparing to geared-drive wind turbines.
This can be attributed to the shorter repair time and lower probability of failures of geared-drive wind
turbines at medium capacity factor locations.

estimated costs than direct-drive turbines which op erate at a high capacity factor, regardless of 
geography, mean annual wind speed and previous failure history. The highest distinction between 
the two turbine designs is noted in high inland locations with the factors of higher number of

drive wind turbines which would lead to higher probability of delayed repair-time at high capacity 
factor locations. On the other hand, on a temper ate high inland location with low MAWS and low 
NOPF geared-drive turbines become more favorable in  terms of failure costs. The cost of failure for 
direct drive wind turbines are generally the most  favorable (repair cost wise) at coastal and low 
inland locations and the least favorable on high inland locations regardless of the other risk factors. This can be attributed to more steady wind regi me and lower gust probability at coastal and low 
inland locations. However, for geared-drive wind turbines, low inland locations become unfavorable 
over high inland locations in cases of low NOPF and low MAWS, although high inland locations are 
generally the least favorable. 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000Temperate-High In land-(0-20)-H MAWSTemperate-Low Inland-(0-20)-H MAWSTemperate-Coastal-(0-20)-H MAWSTemperate-High In land-(0-20)-L MAWSTemperate-Low Inland-(0-20)-L MAWSTemperate-Coastal-(0-20)-L MAWSTemperate-High Inland-(21-more)-H MAWSTemperate-Low Inland-(21-more)-H MAWSTemperate-Coastal-(21-more)-H MAWSTemperate-High Inla nd-(21-more)-L MAWSTemperate-Low Inland-(21-more)-L MAWSTemperate-Coastal- (21-more)-L MAWSCold-High Inland-(0-20)-H MAWSCold-Low Inland-(0-20)-H MAWSCold-Coastal-(0-20)-H MAWSCold-High Inland-(0-20)-L MAWSCold-Low Inland-(0-20)-L MAWSCold-Coastal-(0-20)-L MAWSCold-High Inland-(21-more)-H MAWSCold-Low Inland-(21-more)-H MAWSCold-Coastal-(21-more)-H MAWSCold-High Inland-(21-more)-L MAWSCold-Low Inland-(21-more)-L MAWSCold-Coastal-(21-more)-L MAWS

turbines are generally the most favorable (repair cost wise) at coastal and low inland locations and the
least favorable on high inland locations regardless of the other risk factors. This can be attributed to
more steady wind regime and lower gust probability at coastal and low inland locations. However, for
geared-drive wind turbines, low inland locations become unfavorable over high inland locations in
cases of low NOPF and low MAWS, although high inland locations are generally the least favorable.

This study presents applications of two reliability prediction approaches: The first is Bayesian 
updating for wind turbine failure probability and r e p a i r  t i m e  e s t i m a t i o n  b a s e d  o n  w i n d  t u r b i n e  
design type and environmental and operational conditions. The second approach is prediction of cost of failures for wind turbines based on combinatio ns of environmental and op erational factors, using 
machine learning methods. This study culminated to  a decision support tool for wind farm operators 
to predict cost of failures from wind turbines  based on environmental and operation conditions. 
Consequently, the tool can guide in vestment decisions associated with  specific sites and wind turbine 
types. Furthermore, this tool can be utilized for decision-making in accepting or rejecting a third-party service provider‚Äôs O&M contract offers. The following conclusions are drawn from this study: 
‚Ä¢ Time-to-failure and time-to-repair values for wind turbines vary according to operational 
and environmental conditions. 
‚Ä¢ A high probability of failure is noted at the high inland locations for direct-drive turbines; a 
73% probability of failure within the first month of operation is predicted. However, it 
should be noted that 69% of the failures for dire ct-drive turbines at high inland locations are 
fixed in less than 8 hours. 
‚Ä¢ Higher probability of delayed repairs (more than 1 day) is noted at high inland locations for 
geared-drive turbine types with medium capa city factor and high number of previous 
failures. 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000Temperate-High In land-(0-20)-H MAWSTemperate-Low Inland-(0-20)-H MAWSTemperate-Coastal-(0-20)-H MAWSTemperate-High In land-(0-20)-L MAWSTemperate-Low Inland-(0-20)-L MAWSTemperate-Coastal-(0-20)-L MAWSTemperate-High Inland-(21-more)-H MAWSTemperate-Low Inland-(21-more)-H MAWSTemperate-Coastal-(21-more)-H MAWSTemperate-High Inla nd-(21-more)-L MAWSTemperate-Low Inland-(21-more)-L MAWSTemperate-Coastal- (21-more)-L MAWSCold-High Inland-(0-20)-H MAWSCold-Low Inland-(0-20)-H MAWSCold-Coastal-(0-20)-H MAWSCold-High Inland-(0-20)-L MAWSCold-Low Inland-(0-20)-L MAWSCold-Coastal-(0-20)-L MAWSCold-High Inland-(21-more)-H MAWSCold-Low Inland-(21-more)-H MAWSCold-Coastal-(21-more)-H MAWSCold-High Inland-(21-more)-L MAWSCold-Low Inland-(21-more)-L MAWSCold-Coastal-(21-more)-L MAWS

6. Conclusions
This study presents applications of two reliability prediction approaches: The Ô¨Årst is Bayesian
updating for wind turbine failure probability and repair time estimation based on wind turbine design
type and environmental and operational conditions. The second approach is prediction of cost of
failures for wind turbines based on combinations of environmental and operational factors, using
machine learning methods. This study culminated to a decision support tool for wind farm operators
to predict cost of failures from wind turbines based on environmental and operation conditions.
Consequently, the tool can guide investment decisions associated with speciÔ¨Åc sites and wind turbine
types. Furthermore, this tool can be utilized for decision-making in accepting or rejecting a third-party
service provider‚Äôs O&M contract o ers. The following conclusions are drawn from this study:
 Time-to-failure and time-to-repair values for wind turbines vary according to operational and
environmental conditions.
 A high probability of failure is noted at the high inland locations for direct-drive turbines; a 73%
probability of failure within the Ô¨Årst month of operation is predicted. However, it should be noted
that 69% of the failures for direct-drive turbines at high inland locations are Ô¨Åxed in less than 8 h.

 Higher probability of delayed repairs (more than 1 day) is noted at high inland locations for
geared-drive turbine types with medium capacity factor and high number of previous failures.
 Geared drive turbines have greater expected cost of failures at high inland and high capacity factor
locations that increase the cost of failure di erences between geared and direct drive turbines,
except for the temperate climates.
 High inland locations increase both probability of failures and probability of delayed time-to-repair.
 Medium capacity factor (20 CF40%) lowers failure frequency, but increases delayed
time-to-repair probability for geared-drive wind turbines.
 Direct-drive turbines are more favorable (have lower costs associated with repairs and
unavailability) for locations with high capacity factor (more than 40%) and low capacity factor
(less than 20%) whereas geared-drive turbines are shown to have lower repair and failure costs at
temperate-coastal locations with medium capacity factor (between 20% and 40%) and high mean
annual wind speed (MAWS).
To the authors‚Äô knowledge, this is the Ô¨Årst application of Bayesian updating for predicting
wind turbine failures and time-to-repair in conjunction to wind turbine failure cost estimation using
artiÔ¨Åcial neural network. This study collaborated previous studies that show an increase of failure
probability associated high elevation and high capacity factors [ 4,8]. Additional studies can involve the
following: (a) Up-to-date repair costs. The costs of time-to-repair are assumed to be Ô¨Åxed for geared
and direct-drive wind turbines; however, the material costs might di er in di erent wind turbine types,
and if those are known, the associated values should be introduced in the decision tool. (b) Our study
involves wind turbines which have at most 14 years of operation, and it does not speciÔ¨Åcally consider
a potential wear-out phase towards the last years of a wind turbine lifetime. Therefore, more detailed
time-to-failure and cost for time-to-repair estimations are needed. (c) Future studies should also gather
and investigate data from wind turbine reliability in more distinct climatic conditions and additional
wind turbine types, than those included in the WMEP database.
