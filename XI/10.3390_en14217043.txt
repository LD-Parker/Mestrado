Abstract: Due to the complex and variable conditions under which wind turbines operate, existing
working condition classiﬁcation methods are inadequate for condition assessment of the main
transmission system. Because working conditions are too few after classiﬁcation, it cannot effectively
describe the complex and variable working conditions of wind turbine. This can lead to high false-
alarm rates in the condition monitoring, which affect normal operations. This paper proposes a
working condition classiﬁcation method for the main transmission system of wind turbines based
on supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data. Firstly, correlation analysis of SCADA
data acquired by wind farm is used to select the parameters relevant to the main transmission
system. Secondly, according to the wind turbine control principle, the working conditions are initially
divided into four phases: shutdown, start-up, maximum wind energy tracking, and constant speed.
The k-means clustering algorithm is used to subdivide the maximum wind energy-tracking phase
and constant speed phase, which account for a larger proportion of the working conditions, to
achieve better classiﬁcation. Finally, a case study is used to demonstrate the calculation of alarm
thresholds and alarm rates for each working condition. The results are compared with the direct use
ofk-means clustering for working condition classiﬁcation. It is concluded that the proposed method
can signiﬁcantly reduce the false-alarm rate of the vibration detection process.
Keywords: main transmission system; working conditions classiﬁcation; wind turbine working

1. Introduction
Double-fed wind turbine main transmission systems are mainly composed of a hub,
main shaft, bearings, gearbox, and couplings. They not only provide a transmission channel
for energy but also a transmission path for the unit load. Under long-term operation in
harsh working environments, such as extreme climatic conditions, which involve a wide
range of working speeds and a wide excitation band, time-varying wind loads often cause
oscillation in wind turbine towers, which are somewhat ﬂexible. Then, the inertial forces
of the components of the transmission system may combine with the system’s pneumatic
load and increase the degree of force ﬂuctuations in the components, leading to increased
failure rates. Failures of the main transmission system account for 40–60% of wind turbine
downtime [ 1]. One of the causes of abnormal transmission system conditions is that the real-
time dynamic loads and the dynamic behaviour of the transmission system under diverse
working conditions remain unclear. The operating environments of the main transmission
system are usually complex and harsh. Different wind speeds, wind directions, and rotor
speeds have different effects on the energy output of a wind turbine [ 2], which makes it

very difﬁcult to monitor the condition of its main transmission system. Therefore, it is
essential to classify the working conditions reasonably and accurately before conducting a
conditions assessment.
At present, there are few studies on classifying the working conditions of wind turbine
main transmission systems. Most consider the working conditions of the whole wind
turbine and classify the working conditions according to the operating characteristics of the
wind turbine and the use of clustering algorithms. Yan [ 3] and Mei [ 4] divided the wind
turbine speed and torque control process into four phases: start-up, maximum wind energy
tracking, constant speed generation, and constant power generation. Dai et al. [5] classiﬁed
wind turbine operation according to the relationship between rotor speed and power as
start-up, ﬁrst transition, maximum power point tracking, second transition, and full power.
Yang et al. [ 6] classiﬁed wind turbine operation according to power curve parameters into
four phases. Cheng et al. [ 7] classiﬁed wind turbine operating conditions based on wind
speed-power curves, rotational speed-power curves, rotational speed-pitch angle curves,
and power-pitch angle curves into seven states: normal operation, normal shutdown,
power-limited operation, adjustment process, off-grid process, abnormal shutdown, and
on-grid acceleration. Ling [ 8] identiﬁed the working conditions of the main bearing
according to wind speed and classiﬁed the working conditions as low power, rapid power
increase, and stable power. Gu et al. [ 9] used statistical analysis to classify the working
conditions according to ambient temperature ﬁrst and then by wind speed. However, the
number of classes was relatively small and does not effectively describe the complex and
variable working conditions of wind turbines. This causes a high false-alarm rate during
the monitoring of actual conditions.
Alternatively, working conditions have been classiﬁed using clustering algorithms.
Dong et al. [ 10], Xing et al. [ 11], Zhang et al. [ 12], and Wang et al. [ 13] selected the charac-
teristic parameters of working conditions by analysing the correlations in SCADA data and
using the k-means clustering algorithm to classify historical working conditions during nor-
mal wind turbine operation. Liu et al. [ 14] proposed semi-supervised k-means clustering
with stream-wise distance as a similarity measure for analysing massive SCADA datasets
to classify wind turbine working conditions. Jin [ 15] and Liu et al. [ 16] selected working
conditions feature parameters and used the fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering algorithm to
classify the operating conditions. Yin et al. [ 17] and Chen et al. [ 18] used a Gaussian mix-
ture model (GMM)-based clustering method to classify wind turbine operating conditions
based on condition monitoring data. Ma et al. [19] proposed the adaptive classiﬁcation of
conditions using GMM. Wang et al. [ 20] selected three parameters—wind speed, generator
speed, and active power—and applied the GMM clustering algorithm to classify training
data into three sub-conditions. Han. [ 21] divided SCADA data by month and determined
the optimal interval length according to particle swarm optimization (PSO) and then car-
ried out interval clustering. Han et al. [ 22] proposed a clustering method for wind farms
based on correlation analysis and signiﬁcance testing (CA-ST). Zheng et al. [23] proposed
a PSO optimization kernel principal element analysis (KPCA) method for classifying the
working conditions of offshore wind turbines. However, most of these studies are based
on the direct application of a clustering algorithm to data and do not consider the wind
turbines’ operating mechanisms. Hence, the correlations between wind turbine operating
parameters and operating conditions are unclear and lack theoretical support.
In the ﬁeld of machine learning, clustering is a classical unsupervised learning method.
Commonly used clustering algorithms and their advantages and disadvantages are sum-
marised in Table 1.
Based on a comparative analysis of the clustering algorithms in Table 1, the k-means
clustering algorithm was selected to cluster the working conditions of the main transmis-
sion system of a wind turbine due to the large number of dimensions in the large amount of
SCADA data. The Calinski–Harabasz (CH) criterion was used to determine the number of
clusters in the k-means clustering algorithm, while the initial cluster centres were selected
by the k-means++ algorithm. The speciﬁc method is described in Section 3.1.2.

The working conditions of a wind turbine’s main transmission system are relatively
complex. Figure 1 shows the variation in the vibrational acceleration of the main shaft of
a 2.5-MW wind turbine according to wind speed and power. As can be seen, even when
an operating parameter is ﬁxed, the vibration still shows a very high variability [ 24]. In
classifying the main transmission system’s working conditions, there is a small number
of conditions after classiﬁcation, and the vibrational acceleration may change drastically
within each condition. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the vibrational
acceleration changed drastically due to a fault in the main transmission system fault, and it
is difﬁcult to make an accurate judgment of the system’s operating status.

The Pearson correlation coefﬁcient is used to measure the degree of linear correlation
between two random variables. Assuming the existence of variables Xand Y, the Pearson
correlation coefﬁcient between them is:
rX,Y=cov(X,Y)
sXsY=E((X mX)(Y mY))
sXsY(1)
where cov (X,Y)is the covariance of Xand Y, and sX,sYare their standard deviations.

In general, it is considered that jrj0.5is necessary to consider that two variables are
correlated [33].
The SCADA system collects a large amount of data with a large number of dimensions.
This includes some constant parameters, such as power factor, pitch standby supply voltage,
and grid-side voltage, which do not express the operating status of the wind turbine at the
site and therefore need to be eliminated. Based on expert experience [ 33], a total of 18 status
parameters related to the operating state of the main transmission system were selected
from the SCADA system, as shown in Table 2. Here, the average 30-s power is used as the
performance index. Status parameters with a strong relationship to the active power are
selected from the SCADA system and the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient is calculated, as
shown in Table 2.

3. Classiﬁcation of the Working Conditions of the Main Transmission System
3.1. Introduction to the Principles of the k-Means Clustering Algorithm
The k-means clustering algorithm is a clustering method based on the similarity
between samples. The objective is to minimize the sum of squares of the distances between
all samples and their corresponding cluster centres.
Assuming an input sample set X=fx1,x2,,xng, the number of clusters is k.
k-means clustering can be expressed as the sum of squared errors ( SSE) of convergence.
SSE =k
å
j=1å
mi2jjkmi mjk2(3)
where jjis the ﬁrst jcluster; miis the sample point in jj; and mjisjjthe centre of mass.
3.1.1. The k-Means Clustering Algorithm Process
The k-means clustering algorithm process is as follows:
1. Generate kinitial centre-of-mass points using the k-means++ algorithm: fm1,m2,,mkg.
2. Calculate the distance between each sample point and the centre-of-mass points.
3. Assign sample points to the class nearest to them.
4. Calculate the centre of mass of each class using the sample points that have just been
grouped: calculate the mean value of each cluster coordinate as the centre of mass.
5. Repeat steps 3–5 until its centre of mass no longer changes, or the maximum number
of iteration steps is reached.
6. Output the cluster division C=fC1,C2,,Ckg.
3.1.2. The k-Means++ Algorithm Process
The k-means++ algorithm for generating the initial cluster of centre-of-mass points
ﬂows is as follows:
1. Create an empty set Sfor storing the kprime points of the cluster.
2. Select a random instance from the sample set Xcalled m1, and add it to the ﬁrst cluster
Sas the centre of mass.
3. For each instance xiin the dataset X, calculate the square of the distance to the centre
of mass of each cluster within dataset S, the smallest of which is the square of the
distance xitoS:
d(xi,S)2=min
mj2Skxi mjk2(4)
4. The probability of each sample being selected as the next cluster centre is calculated
as follows. The next cluster centre point miis selected by the roulette wheel method
and added to S.
P(xi) =d(xi,S)2
å
jd(xj,S)2(5)
5. Repeat steps 3–4 until kclusters of centre-of-mass points have been selected.
3.1.3. Determination of the Number of Clusters k
In cluster analysis, the number of clusters kneeds to be obtained ﬁrst, which deter-
mines the effectiveness of clustering. If the kvalue is too small, the range of each condition
interval is too large. This can easily lead to the classiﬁcation of the optimal working interval
range being too large or there being no working conditions that satisfy the minimum
support and minimum feasible degree in the classiﬁcation results, resulting in failure
of classiﬁcation. If kis too large, the interval of each parameter is too detailed, which
increases the dimensionality of the parameters and increases the intermediate data of the
mining process, resulting in a reduction in mining speed. Therefore, this paper adopts the
Calinski–Harabasz (CH) criterion to determine a reasonable number of clusters k.
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2021 ,14, 7043 8 of 18
The CH criterion, also known as the variance ratio criterion, assesses the effect of
clustering using the degree of denseness within clusters and the degree of dispersion
between clusters, which is calculated as follows:
S(k) =tr(Bk)
tr(Wk)m k
k 1(6)
where mis the total number of samples in the training set, kis the number of clusters, Bkis
the covariance matrix between categories, Wkis the covariance matrix of the data within
categories, and tris the trace of the matrix.
After the clustering is completed, the smaller the covariance of the data within cat-
egories and the larger the covariance between categories (i.e., the tighter the classes are
themselves and the more dispersed the classes are), the better the clustering effect will
be, and, accordingly, the higher the CH score will be. Therefore, the optimal number of
clusters can be determined by calculating the CH scores at different kvalues.
3.2. Main Transmission System Working Conditions Classiﬁcation Based on the k-Means
Clustering Algorithm
Most traditional working conditions are classiﬁed directly by clustering algorithms
after selecting the working parameters, without taking into account the operating charac-
teristics of the wind turbine. In different wind speed ranges and under different working
conditions, wind turbines are adjusted by different control methods, so it is necessary to
analyse their control strategies and classify the working conditions in different stages.
Current mainstream doubly-fed wind turbines have a variable-speed and constant-
frequency control strategy; i.e., the wind turbine speed varies with the wind speed to
maintain the best blade-tip-speed ratio and maximum wind-energy conversion efﬁciency.
Figure 3 shows the relationships between the power of a variable-speed, constant-frequency
wind turbine, and wind speed and wind turbine speed. According to the wind turbine’s
power characteristics and wind speed variation, the operation can be theoretically divided
into ﬁve phases as follows [34]:
1. Shutdown phase (OA and E+): Wind speeds are less than the cut-in wind speed vcut_in
or greater than the cut-out wind speed vcut_out;
2. Start-up phase (AB): Wind speeds are greater than the cut-in wind speed vcut_inand
less than the wind speed v1. The wind turbine speed is limited to the minimum
speed wmin;
3. Maximum wind-energy tracking phase (BC): Wind speed is between v1and v2, the
wind turbine speed is between the minimum speed wminand the rated speed wrate,
the wind turbine tip speed ratio remains optimal, and the wind energy utilization
coefﬁcient remains at the maximum;
4. Constant speed phase (CD): Wind speeds are between v2and the rated wind speed
vrate, and the wind turbine speed remains at the rated speed wrate;
5. Constant power phase (DE): Wind speeds are between the rated wind speed vrateand
cut-out wind speed vcut_out, the wind turbine speed is at the rated speed wrate, and
the wind power utilization coefﬁcient is adjusted by adjusting the pitch angle bso
that the wind power output is kept at the rated power Prate.
From the main transmission system status parameters selected by correlation analysis,
operating parameters are selected to classify the main transmission system’s operating
conditions. According to Figure 3, it can be seen that the stages of wind turbine operation
are closely related to wind speed, wind turbine speed, and power. The control strategy
for each stage is different. Firstly, according to the relationships between power and wind
speed and wind turbine speed, there are ﬁve categories because the constant speed stage
includes the constant power stage. Then, the two stages are combined into one category and
collectively referred to as the constant speed stage, making a total of four major categories.

tion coefficient remains at the maximum;

From the main transmission system status parameters selected by correlation analy-
sis, operating parameters are selected to classi fy the main transmissi on system’s operating 
conditions. According to Figure 3, it can be seen that the stages of wind turbine operation 
are closely related to wind speed, wind turb ine speed, and power. The control strategy 
for each stage is different. Firstly, accordin g to the relationships between power and wind 
speed and wind turbine speed, there are five categories because the constant speed stage 
includes the constant power stage. Then, th e two stages are combined into one category 
and collectively referred to as the constant sp eed stage, making a total of four major cate-
gories. 
The purpose of the condition classification is to improve the accuracy of later condi-
tion assessment by subdividing the operating conditions of the wind turbine. The maxi-
mum wind-energy tracking stag e and constant speed stage are the normal working stages 
of the wind turbine and produce a large amount  of data, so it is necessary to subdivide 
the working conditions according to their operating characteristics. In the maximum wind 
energy tracking stage, the power varies with wind speed and wind turbine speed, so the k-means clustering algorithm is used to subdivide the working conditions at this stage

wind-energy tracking stage and constant speed stage are the normal working stages of
the wind turbine and produce a large amount of data, so it is necessary to subdivide the
working conditions according to their operating characteristics. In the maximum wind
energy tracking stage, the power varies with wind speed and wind turbine speed, so the
k-means clustering algorithm is used to subdivide the working conditions at this stage
according to wind turbine speed, wind speed, and power. In the constant speed stage, the
wind turbine speed is constant, so the k-means clustering algorithm is used to subdivide
the working conditions according to wind speed and power. Finally, we can obtain the
ﬁnal working condition classiﬁcation results.
4. Determination of Alarm Thresholds
In the process of wind turbine SCADA system detection, the vibrational acceleration
of the main transmission system can be detected by sensors to reﬂect the operating status.
A vibrational acceleration alarm is mostly an over-limit alarm; i.e., as long as the threshold
is exceeded, the alarm will be generated; otherwise, it will not [ 35]. The data used in this
paper refer to normal wind turbine operation without failure. Theoretically, the detection
system should not issue an alarm; however, during actual state monitoring, false alarms
are difﬁcult to avoid, which requires adjustment of the alarm threshold to reduce the
false-alarm rate as much as possible.
Figure 4 shows the frequency distribution of the average spindle vibrational accel-
eration from SCADA data. The frequency distribution of Figure 4a contains all vibration
data of the wind turbine. In addition, when the wind turbine is running, the vibration
acceleration frequency distribution is shown as Figure 4b. Comparing the two graphs, we
can see that the peak on the left side of Figure 4a, which appears in the shutdown phase of
the wind turbine, we do not consider.
We choose its arithmetic mean mand standard deviation sas the basis for the threshold
and set the alarm threshold Caccording to the 3 scriterion.
C=m+3s (7)
If the vibrational acceleration value exceeds the threshold C, an alarm is generated.
To evaluate the reasonableness of this classiﬁcation, a deﬁnition of the false-alarm rate
is introduced.

 according to wind turbine speed, wind speed, an d power. In the constant speed stage, the 
wind turbine speed is constant, so the k-means clustering algorithm is used to subdivide 
the working conditions according to wind speed and power. Finally, we can obtain the final working condition classification results.

A vibrational acceleration alarm is mostly an over-limit alarm; i.e., as long as the threshold is exceeded, the alarm will be generated; otherwis e, it will not [35]. The data used in this

ation from SCADA data. The frequency distribu tion of Figure 4a contains all vibration

We choose its arithmetic mean μ and standard deviation σ as the basis for the

If the vibrational acceleration  value exceeds the threshold C, an alarm is generated. 
To evaluate the reasonableness of this classification, a definition of the false-alarm rate is introduced. 
In the SCADA historical dataset, it is assumed that the main transmission system has 
n different working conditions corresponding to n alarm thresholds relating to the char-
acteristic value of vibrational acceleration. For the i-th normal operating conditions, the 
total number of samples is 
iB, and the number of samples exceeding the alarm threshold 
is iA. Then, the false-alarm rate iR for the i-th working conditions is:

In the SCADA historical dataset, it is assumed that the main transmission system
hasndifferent working conditions corresponding to nalarm thresholds relating to the
characteristic value of vibrational acceleration. For the i-th normal operating conditions, the
total number of samples is Bi, and the number of samples exceeding the alarm threshold is
Ai. Then, the false-alarm rate Rifor the i-th working conditions is:
Ri=Ai/Bi (8)
Therefore, the false-alarm rate is used as an index of the merit of the classiﬁcation
system. The lower the rate, the better the classiﬁcation.

5.2.1. Data Cleaning
The raw data collected by the SCADA system described the status of the equipment
throughout its lifecycle, including normal operations, failures, shutdowns, maintenance,
and other states. Therefore, the SCADA data contains some “dirty data”, which is mean-
ingless to the analysis and could directly or indirectly affect it. Therefore, the SCADA data
requires cleaning, as follows:
1. Removal of records with status variable values that are missing or recorded as “0”.
2. Referral to maintenance records to remove data recorded when the wind turbine was
down for maintenance.
3. Referring to the method described in [ 36]: the DBSCAN-based density clustering
method is used to eliminate outlier anomalies, and the truncation method is used to
eliminate points where the wind speed is greater than the cut-in wind speed, but the
power is still 0.
Figure 6 compares the wind speed vs power scatterplots before and after cleaning.

5.2.2. Data Normalization 
The amount of data recorded by the SCAD A system is huge, and the magnitudes of 
each type of operating data differ. The ma ximum and minimum values  of different oper-
ating parameters also differ, which will affect  the accuracy of the model. Therefore, the 
historical data needs to be normalized and mapped to the range of 0–1 to eliminate the 
influence of scale. 
Maximum-minimum normalization is used according to the formula:

where ijx is the first i data point corresponding to variable j; max( )jx and min( )jx 
are the maximum and minimu m values of variable j, respectively; and ijx′ is the nor-
malized value. 
After normalization, data containing the 10 characteristic parameters of the main 
transmission system (selected according to the correlation analysis in Section 2) were ob-
tained, as shown in Table 4.

selected, and the main transmission system’s working conditions were classiﬁed.

To compare the effects of the working conditions before and after the method im-
provement, the three characteristic parameters of average spindle speed, 30-s average
wind speed, and 30-s average power were selected using the k-means clustering algorithm
to directly cluster the SCADA data of the wind turbine during normal operation, i.e., to
remove data recorded during shutdown phases. The CH values of samples with different
numbers of clusters from 2 to 10 were calculated, as shown in Figure 7, which shows that
the CH value was largest with ﬁve clusters. Together with the shutdown phase operating
conditions, there are six categories in total.

The traditional method in Figure 8 is used to classify the wind turbine operation
phases into ﬁve categories, while the proposed method in Figure 11 is used to classify
into nine categories. Comparing the ﬁgures, it can be seen that the various phases of
the wind turbine operation can be divided based on the analysis of the wind turbine
operation characteristics, and there is a clear distinction between the wind turbine start-
up phase, the maximum wind energy tracking phase, and the constant speed phase. In
addition, comparing the alarm thresholds and false-alarm rates derived from the 2000
test samples in Tables 5 and 6, it can be concluded that the false-alarm rates calculated
directly using the k-means clustering algorithm basically range between 3% and 6% for each

from the proposed method are basically 0–3% for each condition, with a total false-alarm
rate of 1.15%, which is an improvement compared to that of direct clustering. Therefore,
the working condition classiﬁcation method proposed in this paper can reasonably and
effectively classify the operating conditions of a wind turbine’s main transmission system
and reduce the false-alarm rate in its vibration-detection process.
6. Conclusions
This paper addresses the engineering reality of the un-known real-time dynamic
loads and multi-state dynamic behaviour of the main transmission system of a wind
turbine, which can lead to the early onset of abnormal working conditions. A transmission
system historical working condition classiﬁcation method based on wind turbine operating
characteristics analysis and a k-means clustering algorithm was proposed. The proposed
method is based on the data collected using the SCADA acquisition system. This is
oriented toward the division of working conditions for the later main transmission system
condition assessment.
The selection method of state parameters based on correlation analysis is proposed. In
order to avoid the omission of relevant state parameters and the interference of irrelevant
variables to the results, the redundant variables are eliminated by using Pearson correla-
tion coefﬁcient. Finally, 10 state characteristic parameters of main transmission system
are selected.
Most traditional working conditions are classiﬁed without taking into account the
operating characteristics of the wind turbine. An improved method of working conditions
classiﬁcation is proposed. The working conditions are initially divided into four stages.
Then, the k-means clustering algorithm is used to subdivide the maximum wind-energy
tracking stage and constant speed stage, which account for a relatively large number of
operating conditions. This provides more accurate working conditions for the subsequent
condition assessment of the main transmission system.
The method was applied to a real case study of a wind turbine. To test its effective-
ness, the false-alarm rates during vibration detection was calculated. Furthermore, the
false-alarm rates were signiﬁcantly reduced by compared with working conditions classiﬁ-
cation using the direct k-means clustering algorithm. The results show that the proposed
classiﬁcation method can solve the problems of unclear condition classiﬁcation, too-few
condition categories, and high false-alarm rates that could occur with direct clustering
classiﬁcation based on vibration detection.
The working condition classiﬁcation method can be applied to the real-time moni-
toring of the wind turbine main transmission system at a later stage. In the process of its
condition monitoring, it can reduce the false-alarm rates, improve the accuracy of main
transmission system condition assessment, reduce maintenance costs, and ensure the safety
and economy of wind turbines operating.
