Abstract: Wind turbine (WT) foundations with an embedded steel ring (ESR) are widely used in
onshore WTs due to construction convenience. The research group found that WT foundations with
damage were often accompanied by blade issues. To investigate the potential correlation between
aerodynamic imbalance and fatigue damage of the WT foundation with an ESR, this study focuses
on a 2 MW WT with an ESR. It investigates the influence of an error in pitch angle (PAE) on the WT’s
foundation load and stress, utilizing one year of SCADA data to analyze the fatigue damage caused
by PAE. The main conclusions are as follows: Firstly, the effect of PAE on the amplitude value of
load and stress is significantly greater than on the average value of load and stress. Secondly, when
the PAE is within the range of −3◦to 3◦, the foundation fatigue damage incurred over one year
is minimal, but once this limit is exceeded, the foundation fatigue damage increases dramatically.
Thirdly, the peak value of fatigue damage to the foundation caused by PAE does not necessarily occur
in the main wind direction, but in the direction with the highest probability of the occurrence of high
wind speeds, and the larger the PAE, the more significant the trend.

1. Introduction
Due to its advantages of being easy to design, simple to install, and having no en-
vironmental constraints, an ESR is frequently utilized in onshore WT foundations. In
recent years, issues such as the surface cracking of concrete in WT foundation structures
and the development of gaps and loosening between the ESR and concrete have become
increasingly common. Many researchers have studied the damage mechanism of the WT
concrete foundations with an ESR. The ESR, serving as a connecting component between
the WT tower and its foundation, plays a crucial role in transmitting the upper loads to
the foundation. Wang et al. [ 1] used ANSYS software to investigate the non-linear contact
between the ESR and concrete on the basis of concrete elastoplastic constitutive. They also
researched the internal mechanical characteristics and laws of the foundation, which are
under the influence of wind in an unfixed direction. During their operational lifespan,
WT foundations are subjected to 107cycles of fatigue loading, which often leads to the
formation of cracks on their surfaces. McAlorum et al. [ 2] monitored cracks on the surface of
the WT foundation with FBG-based long-gauge strain sensors, and in this paper, the cracks
on the surface of the WT’s foundation are divided into three types: reactive, permanent,
and behavioral, and are described in detail. At the same time, large tensile and compressive
forces are transferred to the foundation by the ESR, and the concrete in the anchorage zone
of the ESR is subjected to high-cycle fatigue loading, causing concrete in foundations to
operate at higher stress [ 3–6]. If things continue this way, the concrete in the compressive

zone of the WT foundation may experience high cycling, resulting in fatigue accumulation.
Long-term cyclic loading causes the crushing of concrete in the anchorage zone of the ESR,
resulting in reduced stiffness and bearing capacity of the WT foundation [ 7]. Furthermore,
during the construction of WT foundations, inadequate compaction results in substandard
concrete quality, and the rapid change in wind speed and direction during the operation
of the WT will also lead to fatigue damage to the foundation [ 8]. He and Bai et al. [ 9,10]
found that the WT foundation concrete began to have local deformation from the bottom
flange of the ESR when monitoring the condition of the WT foundation using strain sensors,
and the change in concrete crack width is related to the change in wind speed and rotor
position during WT operation. To analyze the fatigue reliability of structures [ 11], Zhao
et al. [ 12] studied the fatigue reliability of a WT under wind loads using the probability
density evolution method. Mankar et al. [ 13] presented a probabilistic framework for a
reliability assessment of onshore WT foundations with the aim of optimizing the design.
Zhu et al. [ 14] proposed a method using the Markov model and a subset simulation to
assess the fatigue reliability of WTs for long-term operation.
In the inspection of wind farms, the research group found that the WTs with a loose
ESR were often accompanied by abnormal blades: The 15# WT in a wind farm in Chenzhou,
Hunan Province, once suffered a significant amount of concrete cracking around the ESR,
necessitating reinforcement. However, approximately one year later, the concrete fracture
phenomenon reappeared, as shown in Figure 1a. Upon inspection, it was discovered that
one of the WT’s blades had suffered severe perforation, as depicted in Figure 1b. The
23# WT in a wind farm in Yongzhou, Hunan Province, also suffered extensive concrete
cracking around the ESR, and the horizontal misalignment of the ESR reached 12 mm.
The owner reported that this WT exhibited a persistently drooping blade in the stationary
state, and the blade had undergone multiple repairs, as shown in Figure 1d. In light of
these observations, the research group hypothesized that the aerodynamic imbalance of
the blades could potentially contribute to the failure of the WT foundation with an ESR.
This paper aims to explore the effect of aerodynamic imbalance on the fatigue performance
of WT foundations with an ESR.

problematic WT blade; ( c) 23# problematic WT foundation; ( d) 23# problematic WT blade.
At present, the research on aerodynamic imbalance mainly focuses on three aspects:
(1) the influence of aerodynamic imbalance on the operation performance of a WT; (2) meth-
ods for detecting aerodynamic imbalance; and (3) control of aerodynamic imbalance. But
the effect of an aerodynamic imbalance on the service performance of a WT concrete founda-
tion with an ESR has not been reported. Niebsch and Jiang et al. [ 15,16] introduced in detail
the force and vibration characteristics of the top of the tower under normal conditions,
aerodynamic imbalance, and mass imbalance conditions. Zhao, Wu, and Qin et al. [ 17–19]
simulated the WT using GH Bladed software and introduced the time and frequency do-
main characteristics of tower top load and vibration signals under aerodynamic imbalance
conditions. Malik et al. [20,21] proposed a WT condition monitoring method using proba-
bilistic neural networks (PNNs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and empirical mode
decomposition (EMD). Based on FAST, TurbSim, and Simulink simulations, this method
can identify WT rotor imbalance faults by receiving current signals from the WT. Tarabini

et al. [ 22] proposed a method for the uncertainty-based combination of signal processing
techniques for the identification of rotor imbalances by combining dynamic and static
signals. Xing et al. [ 23] simulated an aerodynamic imbalance by changing the azimuth of
the rotor, proposed a novel framework for detecting aerodynamic imbalance based on the
intrinsic mode functions of nacelle vibration, determined the degree of the aerodynamic
imbalance by using the nacelle acceleration as an input variable through the convolutional
neural network, and finally verified the framework by simulation. Li et al. [ 24] proposed a
method that integrates the order tracking analysis method and the power spectral density
method, which analyzes the aerodynamic torque to detect imbalance faults using GH
Bladed and MATLAB software. In order to mitigate the structural impact of aerodynamic
imbalance, Tang et al. [ 25] analyzed the failure mechanism of the traditional individual
pitch controller based on the frequency-domain decomposition method and proposed a
robust individual pitch controller to suppress imbalanced loads.
In this paper, the simulation of aerodynamic imbalance is realized by changing the
pitch angle of one blade. It combines steady-state wind loads with turbulent wind loads
and analyzes the WT’s foundation load and stress response under aerodynamic imbalance.
Furthermore, it calculates the fatigue damage to the wind turbine foundation in 3D tur-
bulent wind conditions by considering the probability of the occurrence of wind speed
and wind direction. The study also examines the impact of blade aerodynamic imbalance
on the operational performance of a pitch-regulated WT. Finally, it analyzes the effect of
aerodynamic imbalance on the service performance of the WT concrete foundation with
an ESR.

3. Effect of Aerodynamic Imbalance on Foundation Loads
3.1. Simulation of Aerodynamic Imbalance
In order to accurately obtain the loads on the WT foundation under the aerodynamic
imbalance, the international authority of WT load analysis software, GH Bladed, was used
to establish the 2 MW WT, and the main parameters are shown in Table 1. The type of
WT foundation was selected as an onshore foundation, and without consideration for
rotational and translational stiffness, Figure 4 shows the model of the 2 MW WT established
by GH Bladed.
Figure 4. 2 MW WT model established by GH Bladed.
The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of aerodynamic imbalance on the
fatigue damage of the WT foundation with an ESR; therefore, only normal wind conditions
are discussed here, not extreme wind conditions. The actual wind load on the WT is 3D
turbulent wind; therefore, it is necessary to simulate the turbulent wind at different average
wind speeds for load simulation. To make the simulation comprehensive, Table 1 shows
that the WT’s normal use is in the wind speed range of 3–25 m/s. GH Bladed calculated
10 turbulent winds for a duration of 600 s, with wind speed values of 4 m/s, 6 m/s, 8 m/s,
10 m/s, 12 m/s, 14 m/s, 16 m/s, 18 m/s, 20 m/s, and 22 m/s (10 min average wind speed).
The parameters of the turbulent wind simulation were calculated according to
IEC61400-1 [ 26]. The Kaimal frequency spectrum was chosen for the type of turbulent
spectral, where the turbulence scale parameters are: the longitudinal turbulence scale is
340.2 m, the lateral turbulence scale is 113.4 m, and the vertical turbulence scale is 27.72 m.
The turbulence standard deviation, σ1, at different average wind speeds is calculated
as follows:
σ1=Ire f(0.75Vhub+5.6) (1)
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Buildings 2024 ,14, 1141 5 of 23
where Irefis the reference value of the turbulence intensity, and 0.14 is used here; Vhubis the
average hub height wind speed.
Consequently, the turbulence intensity for 3D turbulent wind can be determined as
follows: the longitudinal turbulence intensity is σ1/Vhub, the lateral turbulence intensity is
0.8σ1/Vhub, and the vertical turbulence intensity is 0.5 σ1/Vhub. It is evident that the lateral
and vertical turbulence intensities are directly proportional to the longitudinal turbulence
intensity of the turbulent wind. Figure 5 illustrates the variations in the turbulence standard
deviation ( σ1) and the longitudinal turbulence intensity ( σ1/Vhub) with changes in wind
speed for different average wind speeds in this study. It can be observed that the turbulence
standard deviation ( σ1) is proportional to wind speed, while the longitudinal turbulence
intensity ( σ1/Vhub) is inversely proportional to wind speed.
Figure 5. Turbulence standard deviation and longitudinal turbulence intensity for the normal
turbulence model.
The turbulent wind at different average wind speeds can be obtained by employing
the aforementioned settings for turbulent wind parameters. Figure 6 shows the time history
curves of turbulent wind at average wind speeds of 6 m/s, 10 m/s, and 14 m/s for a
duration of 600 s. The other seven wind speed time history curves are not shown here as
space is limited. All subsequent simulations in this paper were conducted under these ten
distinct average wind speeds.
Figure 6. Turbulent wind time history curve with an average wind speed of 6 m/s, 10 m/s, and
14 m/s.
The turbulent winds obtained above at different average wind speeds were applied
to the model built by GH Bladed. The sampling time was 0.05 s, which corresponds to
a sampling rate of 20 Hz. According to IEC61400-1, the influence of an inclination of
the mean flow with respect to a horizontal plane of 8◦shall be considered, and this flow
inclination angle shall be assumed to be invariant with height. There are several causes
of aerodynamic imbalance, but PAE, in which a blade does not pitch in its commanded
position, provides a convenient simulation method. Only a single blade was commanded to
undergo PAE in this paper. In practical WT operation, significant aerodynamic imbalances
are not permissible in the wind field. Smaller aerodynamic imbalances are difficult to

detect, and they can take various forms. In order to make the simulation and analysis more
comprehensive, the PAE was increased from −4◦to 4◦in increments of 1◦on one blade of
the WT in this paper. These values were chosen to represent a relatively realistic and small
aerodynamic imbalance. In the simulation, 0◦is the normal WT operating condition, 1◦
to 4◦is the positive PAE, and −1◦to−4◦is the negative PAE. From this, the loads on the
foundation of the WT can be obtained for different degrees of aerodynamic imbalance.
3.2. Effect of P AE and Wind Velocity on the Foundation Loads
Although the load simulation for 600 s was performed by GH Bladed in Section 3.1,
Figure 7 only shows the time history curves of the WT foundation loads for turbulent wind
conditions with an average wind speed of 10 m/s within the 100 s to 200 s range for clarity
of reading. Additionally, the example box within the figure lists the average value of each
load over 600 s. The loads on the WT foundation under other wind speeds are not shown
here as space is limited.
Figure 7. Time history curves and average value of six foundation loads under turbulent wind with
an average wind speed of 10 m/s: ( a) time history curve of Fx; (b) time history curve of Fy; (c) time
history curve of Fz; (d) time history curve of Mx; (e) time history curve of My; (f) time history curve
ofMz.
As shown in Figure 7, both positive and negative PAE result in an increase in load
fluctuation amplitudes. Specifically, the time histories of Fx,Mx,My, and Mzexhibit
significant variations, whereas those of Fyand Fzare less pronounced. Looking at the
average value of the loads in Figure 7, it can be clearly seen that the average values of Fx,
My, and Mzdecrease with positive PAE and increase with negative PAE. The average value
ofMxdecreases for both positive and negative PAE, and the average values of Fyand Fz
remain largely unaffected by PAE.
To conduct a more in-depth analysis of the impact of aerodynamic imbalance on the
foundation load of a WT, simulations were performed using GH Bladed software under

the influence of steady-state wind conditions (6 m/s, 10 m/s, and 14 m/s) for a duration
of 600 s. Under steady-state wind conditions, the load response of the WT foundation
exhibited a sinusoidal-like time history, as shown in Figure 8. Figure 9 provides definitions
for the average and amplitude of this time history curve. The effect of PAE on amplitude
and an average value of 6 loads of WT foundation under steady-state wind with an average
wind speed of 6 m/s, 10 m/s, and 14 m/s is shown in Figures 10–12, where the black
solid line represents the average value of the loads and the red solid line represents the
amplitude value of the loads.

From the red solid line in Figures 10 –12, it can be seen that the amplitude value of six 
loads under steady-state wind will increase with  the increase in the positive and negative 
PAE. At the same time, the e ﬀect of the PAE on the amplitude value of the load gradually 
increases with an increase in wind velocity. Looking at the black solid line in Figure 11, 
the in ﬂuence of steady-state wind and turbulent wi nd on the average value of load is con-
sistent. However, the in ﬂuence of PAE on load is di ﬀerent under di ﬀerent wind speeds. 
In order to understand the e ﬀect of PAE on the percent change in load, we de ﬁne the 
percent change in load as follows:

From the red solid line in Figures 10–12, it can be seen that the amplitude value of six
loads under steady-state wind will increase with the increase in the positive and negative
PAE. At the same time, the effect of the PAE on the amplitude value of the load gradually
increases with an increase in wind velocity. Looking at the black solid line in Figure 11,
the influence of steady-state wind and turbulent wind on the average value of load is
consistent. However, the influence of PAE on load is different under different wind speeds.
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

In order to understand the effect of PAE on the percent change in load, we define the
percent change in load as follows:
percent change o f load =Load o f P AE-Load without PAE
Load without PAE×100% (2)
Figure 13 shows the effect of PAE on the percent change in the average value of the
load under steady-state wind. It can be seen that the largest effect is the average value of
Mz. Figure 14 shows the effect of PAE on the percent change in the amplitude value of
the load under steady-state wind. It can be seen that with the increase in wind speed, the
influence of PAE on the amplitude value of Mxbecomes more and more significant. At
the same time, combined with Figures 10–12, it can be seen that the impact of PAE on the
amplitude value of Myis also very drastic. It is evident that the effect of PAE on the percent
change in the load amplitude is significantly greater than that on the load average value.
Figure 13. Effect of PAE on the percent change in the average value of the load under steady-state
wind: ( a) 6 m/s; ( b) 10 m/s; ( c) 14 m/s.
Figure 14. Effect of PAE on the percent change in the amplitude value of the load under steady-state
wind: ( a) 6 m/s; ( b) 10 m/s; ( c) 14 m/s.
To summarize, the conclusions are as follows: (1) The influence of PAE under turbulent
wind conditions on WT foundation loads exhibits consistency with the patterns observed
under steady-state wind conditions. (2) The effect of PAE on the amplitude value of the
load is significantly greater than on the average value of the load, and at the same time, the
effect of PAE on the amplitude value of the load gradually increases with the increase in
wind velocity. (3) Among the six foundation loads, the amplitude values of Mxand Myare
the most sensitive to PAE. The combined force of Mxand Myis the overturning load on
the WT foundation and is decisive for the design of the foundation; the drastic change in
amplitude value of the overturning load will obviously have a significant impact on the
fatigue damage of the WT foundation.

4. Effect of Aerodynamic Imbalance on Foundation Stress
4.1. Finite Element Modeling of the WT Foundation
ABAQUS was used for finite element (FE) modeling and stress analysis in this paper.
The load on the foundation of the WT under turbulent wind is obtained from Section 3.1,
and the detailed FE model is developed by ABAQUS (as shown in Figure 2). The contact
constraints are adopted between the ESR and the concrete. The normal direction of the
contact surface is set to be hard contact, and the friction effect of the tangential direction
is simulated through the penalty function method. The friction coefficient is taken as 0.4
in the analysis. The reinforcement cage is embedded in the concrete, assuming a perfect
bond between the steel and the concrete. A load reference point is developed at the center
of the upper flange of the ESR and coupled to the upper flange of the ESR for applying the
loads transferred from the tower. Finally, displacements and rotations in all directions at
the nodes of the foundation surface are prevented.
The concrete foundation and the ESR are all meshed by the 3D hexahedral linear
reduction integral unit C3D8R. The reinforcement cage is modeled with the two-node truss
element T3D2. Multi-mesh densities are adopted for different parts of the model, with
zones near the ESR using fine meshes.
The strength grade of the concrete of the WT foundation is C40, the density is
2500 kg/m3,the elastic modulus is 32.5 GPa, the expansion angle is 30◦, the standard value
of tensile strength is 2.39 MPa, the standard value of compressive strength is 26.8 MPa ,
the biaxial/uniaxial is 1.16, the eccentricity is 0.1, the eccentric distance is 0.6667, and
the Poisson’s ratio is 0.2. The concrete-damaged plasticity (CDP) model is adopted in
ABAQUS. The ideal elastoplastic models are applied for the ESR and the reinforcing cage,
in which their strength grades are HRB400, the density is 7850 kg/m3, the elastic mod-
ulus is 206 GPa, the standard value of tensile strength is 345 MPa, the standard value of
compressive strength is 345 MPa, and the Poisson’s ratio is 0.3.
4.2. Model Validation
The group carried out strain monitoring of the ESR of the WT foundation under study.
The strain monitoring data of nacelle position and hub speed (11 rpm) stability during
the monitoring period were extracted. The strain time history at the same hub speed and
nacelle position as the experiment was extracted from ABAQUS. Figure 15 shows the
frequency domain signal of strain obtained by FFT transformation of the strain time history
obtained by experiment and simulation. Due to the close connection between strain and
load, the foundation load Mxtime history curve was extracted at a hub speed of 11 rpm,
and the FFT transformation was performed to obtain the load frequency-domain signal as
shown in Figure 16. The other load frequency domain signals are not shown here as space
is limited, and their results were similar to Mx.

Figure 16. Frequency domain signals of the foundation load of Mxin GH Bladed.
There are three peaks in both Figures 15 and 16. Where 1P is the 1 time rotation
frequency of the rotor (0.183 Hz), 3P is the 3 time rotation frequency of the rotor (0.549 Hz),
and T is the natural frequency of the structure (0.34 Hz). The frequency domain signals
were found to be in good agreement. The above analysis can prove the reliability of the
finite element model and load simulation model in this paper.
4.3. Effect of P AE and Wind Velocity on Foundation Stress
The foundation loads under different PAEs obtained from GH Bladed in Section 3.1
were applied to the foundation FE model. Subsequently, dynamic response analyses were
conducted under varying wind speeds and PAEs, resulting in the dynamic response of
the WT foundation subjected to 3D turbulent wind for a duration of 600 s. FE results
show that stress concentration occurred in the ESR on the leeward side, as well as in the
concrete below the bottom flange of the ESR, and the reinforcement cage shows a stress
concentration in the area around the upper flange on the windward side, as shown in the
interior of the black area in Figure 17. At the same time, the most dangerous elements were
marked in Figure 17, and subsequent descriptions of stress concentration positions in this
paper refer to the most dangerous elements in the figure.
Figure 17. WT foundation stress concentration position display: ( a) embedded steel ring; ( b) concrete;
(c) reinforcement cage.
Figure 18 shows the equivalent stress cloud of concrete compressive stress for different
PAEs with an average wind speed of 10 m/s. It can be seen that the PAE significantly
increases the range of stress concentration in the foundation concrete, and the degree of
stress concentration decreases along the projection of the ESR to both sides.

As shown in Figure 19, both positive and negative PAE will lead to an increase in
the stress concentration position fluctuation amplitude. Meanwhile, the average values
of compressive stress of concrete and mises stress of the ESR decrease with positive PAE,
while they increase with negative PAE. The average value of tensile stress in concrete
decreases with both positive and negative PAE, and the average value of mises stress in the
reinforcement cage increases with both positive and negative PAE.
The effect of PAE on the above four stresses under steady-state wind with different
wind speeds is shown in Figures 20–22, where the black solid line represents the average
value of the stress and the red solid line represents the amplitude value of the stress, with
the meanings of amplitude and average values consistent with those presented in Figure 9.

From the red solid line in Figures 20–22, it can be clearly seen that an amplitude value
of stress of 4 under steady-state wind will increase with the increase in the positive and
negative PAE. At the same time, the effect of the PAE on the amplitude value of stress
gradually increases with an increase in wind velocity. Looking at the black solid line in
Figure 21, the influence of steady-state wind and turbulent wind on the average value
of stress is consistent. However, the influence of PAE on stress is different at different
wind speeds.
The influence of PAE on the percent change in stress, as calculated by Equation (3), is
presented in Figures 23 and 24. It can be seen that the percent change in the average value
and amplitude value of stress increases with an increase in PAE. The effect of PAE on the
amplitude of stress is significantly greater than its effect on the average value of stress. In
addition, the effect of the PAE on the amplitude value of stress gradually increases with an
increase in wind velocity.

effect on the amplitude value of stress at the stress concentration position in concrete,
the ESR, and the reinforcement cage than on the corresponding average value of stress.
(2) The PAE will significantly increase the amplitude value of stress at a stress concentration
position. (3) The effect of the PAE on the amplitude value of stress gradually increases with
an increase in wind velocity.

5. Analysis of the Fatigue Damage to the WT Foundation Based on Annual
SCADA Data
5.1. One Year of Wind Direction and Speed Analysis
The SCADA data of the 5# WT studied in this paper for the whole year of 2022
were extracted. The 5# WT operated normally for a total of 3000 h during 2022. The
wind direction in the SCADA data is divided into 12 directions with an interval of 30◦,
labeled from N–NNW. In each wind direction area, the average wind speed is divided into
10 intervals: 4 m/s, 6 m/s, 8 m/s, 10 m/s, 12 m/s, 14 m/s, 16 m/s, 18 m/s, 20 m/s, and
22 m/s. Thus, there are 120 wind speed–wind direction combinations. From this, we can
calculate the operating time of the 5# WT in 2022 under different wind directions and wind
speeds and obtain the probability of the occurrence of each wind speed–wind direction
interval in 2022, as shown in Table 2.

The probability of the occurrence of wind direction and wind speed is shown in
Figures 25 and 26, respectively. As can be seen from the figure: (1) In 2022, the wind
direction of the 5# WT is mainly concentrated in four directions, N, NNW, NNE, and ESE,
and the probability of its occurrence is 19.18%, 15.63%, 12.16%, and 11.41%, respectively.
(2) The wind speed is mainly 10 m/s and below, with only a 15% probability of wind speeds
exceeding the rated wind speed in 2022.

5.2. S–N Curve of Concrete Fatigue Damage
Fatigue damage [ 27] refers to the degree of damage to the material under fatigue
loading, and it is generally represented by a dimensionless parameter D. The fatigue
cumulative damage theory [ 28,29] is used to calculate structure fatigue damage under the
fatigue load. At present, the Palmgren–Miner linear cumulative damage criterion [ 30,31] is
used to calculate the fatigue damage of a structural fatigue hot spot. In this study, we also
employ the P–M criterion and utilize S–N curves to assess the effect of PAE on the fatigue
damage of a WT foundation with an ESR.
The WT foundation is required to withstand 107load cycles during its design service
life. Therefore, this paper adopts the FIB Model Code [ 32] issued by the International
Federation for Structure Concrete to calculate the fatigue damage of concrete at the bottom
flange of the WT foundation. The concrete S–N curve used in this paper is:
logN1=8
Y−1·(Scd,max−1) (4)
logN2=8+8·ln(10)
Y−1·(Y−Scd,min)·log(Scd,max−Scd,min
Y−Scd,min) (5)
where Y=0.45+1.8·Scd,min
1+1.8·Scd,min−0.3·S2
cd,min;Scd,minis the minimum compressive stress level, which
can be obtained by Equation (6); Scd,max is the maximum compressive stress level, which
can be obtained by Equation (7); and N1,N2is the number of cycles to failure, where if
logN1≤8, then log N= log N1, and if log N1> 8, then log N= log N2.
Scd,min=γEdσc,minηc/fcd,f at (6)
Scd,max=γEdσc,maxηc/fcd,f at (7)
where σc,minis the minimum compressive stress in MPa; σc,max is the maximum compressive
stress in MPa; γEdis the partial safety factor for fatigue load, and 1.1 is used here; ηcis
the averaging factor for concrete stresses in the compression zone considering the stress
gradient, and 0.8 is used here; and fcd,f atis the fatigue strength of the concrete within the
design life, which can be calculated according to Equations (8) and (9):
fcd,f at=0.85·βcc(t)·fcd·(1−fcd
400)/γc,f at (8)
βcc(t) =expn
s·[1−(28/t)0.5]o
(9)
where βcc(t)is a coefficient that depends on the age of concrete at the beginning of fatigue
loading; fcdis the characteristic value of the compressive strength of concrete; γc,f atis the
partial safety factor for material, and 1.5 is used here; sis a coefficient that depends on the
strength class of cement; and tis the concrete age in days.

Fatigue damage Dof concrete is calculated using the Palmgren–Miner summation:
D=∑

where Dis the fatigue damage, and when D> 1, it indicates that the material has reached
its fatigue life; niis the actual cycles of stress; and Nfiis the failure cycles corresponding to
the stress amplitude, which can be calculated according to Equations (4)–(9).
5.3. Calculation Method for Fatigue Damage to the WT Foundation Concrete
It can be seen from Section 4.3 that stress concentration occurs in the bottom flange of
the ESR on the leeward side of the WT foundation concrete under wind load. The rain flow
counting (RFC) method is used to calculate the stress time history of concrete in this area.
Therefore, we can obtain the fatigue stress amplitude, average, and cycles for the 600 s
dynamic response.
The statistical results of the time history of the tensile stress of concrete at the stress
concentration under turbulent wind (600 s) with an average wind speed of 10 m/s are
shown in Figure 27. The RFC results of other stress time histories are not shown here as
space is limited. The graph reveals that, in comparison to the case where the PAE is 0◦, the
occurrence of PAE leads to a significant increase in the number of high-stress amplitude
cycles. Furthermore, the influence of positive PAE on stress amplitude is more pronounced
than that of negative PAE.
Figure 27. Statistical results of the time history of the tensile stress of concrete at the stress concen-
tration under turbulent wind (600 s) with an average wind speed of 10 m/s: ( a) 0◦PAE; ( b) 4◦PAE;
(c)−4◦PAE.
Since the results obtained from the RFC cannot be directly used to calculate the fatigue
damage, the Goodman curve is used to equivalently convert the stress amplitude and the
average stress in the RFC to obtain the equivalent stress amplitude [ 33]. These equivalent
stress amplitudes are then used in conjunction with material S–N curves to calculate the
fatigue damage at critical locations in the structure. This process can be implemented
through MATLAB programming.
The fatigue damage to the WT foundation concrete under turbulent wind can be
obtained by combining the modified RFC results with the S–N curve of the material.
According to Equations (4)–(10), the fatigue damage of the WT foundation under a
single wind speed and a single wind direction in 2022 can be obtained by combining the
operating time of the 5# WT in 2022 with the probability of occurrence of wind speed–wind
direction. As shown in Table 2, the probability of turbulent wind with a wind speed of
10 m/s in the N direction in 2022 is 4.13%. Given that the WT operates for 3000 h per year,
it can be inferred that the WT operates for 123.9 h under the corresponding wind direction
and wind speed conditions. Similarly, the WT operates for 120.3 h in turbulent wind with
an average wind speed of 6 m/s and 23.1 h in turbulent wind with an average wind speed
of 14 m/s. The fatigue damage of concrete at the bottom flange of the ESR on the leeward
side (direction S) is calculated according to Equations (4)–(10), as shown in Figure 28. It
can be seen that the fatigue damage increases with the increase in PAE. At the same time,
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Buildings 2024 ,14, 1141 18 of 23
although the probability of high wind speed is very small, the influence of high wind speed
on the fatigue damage of the foundation is much greater than that of low wind speed.
Figure 28. Fatigue damage to the concrete at the bottom flange of the ESR on the leeward side under
turbulent wind with wind direction N: ( a) wind speed is 6 m/s; ( b) wind speed is 10 m/s; ( c) wind
speed is 14 m/s.
5.4. Fatigue Damage to the WT Foundation Concrete Caused by P AE
Turbulent wind with different wind speeds and directions will cause different degrees
of damage to concrete at different positions of the foundation. In order to accurately analyze
the effect of PAE on the fatigue damage to the WT foundation concrete, the fatigue damage
to the concrete (12 directions: N–NNW) at the bottom flange of the ESR under different
PAEs was calculated based on the statistical data presented in Table 2.
Figure 29 illustrates the fatigue damage to the bottom concrete of the ESR under
turbulent wind conditions with a wind direction of N and a wind speed of 10 m/s at
various PAEs after 123.9 h. The fatigue damage to the foundation concrete under other
PAEs is not shown here as space is limited. It can be observed that: (1) Fatigue damage
to the concrete is most severe on the leeward side and gradually decreases towards both
sides. (2) Fatigue damage increases with increasing PAE, and the fatigue damage caused
by positive PAE is greater than that caused by negative PAE.
Figure 29. Fatigue damage to the concrete at the bottom flange of the ESR in 12 directions under
turbulent wind with wind direction N and a wind speed of 10 m/s under different PAEs after 123.9 h:
(a)−4◦PAE; ( b) 0◦PAE; ( c) 4◦PAE.
The fatigue damage to the WT foundation is caused by the accumulation of loads
from different wind speeds and directions. Therefore, the obtained fatigue damages are
multiplied by the probability of occurrence of the respective wind direction–wind speed
(as shown in Table 2), and the results are summed to obtain the total fatigue damage after
one year of operation (3000 h), as shown in Figure 30. It can be seen from the figure that the
relative relationship of fatigue damage in 12 directions is convergent under different PAEs.
In other words, the maximum fatigue damage occurs in the S direction or SSE direction,
which is obviously related to the main wind direction shown in Figure 25. Figure 31 shows
the relationship between the fatigue damage and the PAE in 12 directions. It can be seen
that when the PAE is within the range of −3◦to 3◦, the foundation fatigue damage incurred
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Buildings 2024 ,14, 1141 19 of 23
over one year is minimal, but once this limit is exceeded, the foundation fatigue damage
increases dramatically. In particular, for more than 3◦positive PAE, one year is enough to
cause fatigue failure in the foundation concrete.

PAE; ( f)−1◦PAE; ( g)−2◦PAE; ( h)−3◦PAE; ( i)−4◦PAE.

year of operation for the 5# WT with different PAEs.
5.5. Further Analysis
From Figure 25, it can be seen that the 5# WT has the highest probability of occurrence
in the N direction, which reaches 19.14%. Consequently, the direction of the most serious
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Buildings 2024 ,14, 1141 20 of 23
fatigue damage to the foundation concrete should be in the direction of S. However,
Figure 30 shows that when the PAE exceeds ±1◦, the direction with the maximum fatigue
damage is not in the S direction but rather in the SSE direction.
In order to investigate the cause of this phenomenon, the source of fatigue damage
in the SSE direction was statistically analyzed, as shown in Figure 32. In the figure, the
horizontal coordinate axis on the left side of the three-dimensional figure represents the wind
direction, which corresponds to the 12 directions in Table 2, and the horizontal coordinate
axis on the right side represents the wind speed, which corresponds to the 10 wind speeds
in Table 2. The height of each cubic column in the figure represents the proportion of the
fatigue damage occurring in the SSE direction throughout the year under the influence
of the respective wind direction and wind speed (with duration calculated based on the
probabilities from Table 2). As can be seen from the figure: (1) The primary cause of fatigue
damage occurring in the SSE direction is the wind from the NNW direction. (2) When the
PAE is 0◦or±1◦, the wind from the NNW direction with wind speeds ranging from 10 m/s
to 14 m/s results in the highest proportion of fatigue damage in the SSE direction throughout
the year. However, when the PAE exceeds ±2◦, the proportion of fatigue damage caused by
wind speeds of 18 m/s to 22 m/s from the NNW direction dramatically increases. (3) When
the PAE reaches ±4◦, almost all of the SSE direction’s annual fatigue damage is attributed to
winds from the NNW direction with wind speeds of 18 m/s to 22 m/s.

6. Conclusions 
This study focuses on a 2 MW WT with an ESR to investigate the e ﬀect of aerody-
namic imbalance on WT foundation loads an d stresses. The foundation fatigue damage 
caused by aerodynamic imbalance based on the SCADA data for one year was analyzed. 
The conclusions are as follows: 
(1) The in ﬂuence of PAE under turbulent wind conditions on WT foundation loads ex-
hibits consistency with the pa tterns observed under steady-state wind conditions. 
The eﬀect of the PAE on the amplitude value of the load is signi ﬁcantly greater than 
on the average value of the load. The e ﬀect of the PAE on the amplitude value of the 
load gradually increases with an increase in wind velocity. Among the six foundation 
loads, the amplitude values of Mx and My are most sensitive to PAE. 
(2) The PAE has a signi ﬁcantly greater e ﬀect on the amplitude value of stress at stress 
concentration positions in concrete, the ESR, and the reinforcement cage than on the 
corresponding average value of stress. The PAE will signi ﬁcantly increase the ampli-
tude value of stress at the stress concentration position. The e ﬀect of the PAE on the 
amplitude value of stress gradually increases with an increase in wind velocity.

According to Table 2, in the year 2022, the probability of the occurrence of wind
with a wind speed of 18–22 m/s in the NNW direction reaches 1.01%, making it the
highest probability among the twelve directions. But in the N direction, the probability
of the occurrence of wind speeds in the range of 18 m/s to 22 m/s was only 0.39%. It
can be seen that the peak value of fatigue damage to the foundation concrete caused by
PAE does not necessarily occur in the main wind direction, but in the direction with the
highest probability of the occurrence of high wind speeds, and the larger the PAE, the more
significant the trend.
6. Conclusions
This study focuses on a 2 MW WT with an ESR to investigate the effect of aerodynamic
imbalance on WT foundation loads and stresses. The foundation fatigue damage caused
by aerodynamic imbalance based on the SCADA data for one year was analyzed. The
conclusions are as follows:
(1) The influence of PAE under turbulent wind conditions on WT foundation loads
exhibits consistency with the patterns observed under steady-state wind conditions.
The effect of the PAE on the amplitude value of the load is significantly greater than
on the average value of the load. The effect of the PAE on the amplitude value of the
load gradually increases with an increase in wind velocity. Among the six foundation
loads, the amplitude values of Mxand Myare most sensitive to PAE.
(2) The PAE has a significantly greater effect on the amplitude value of stress at stress
concentration positions in concrete, the ESR, and the reinforcement cage than on
the corresponding average value of stress. The PAE will significantly increase the
amplitude value of stress at the stress concentration position. The effect of the PAE on
the amplitude value of stress gradually increases with an increase in wind velocity.
(3) Fatigue damage to the concrete is the most severe on the leeward side and gradually
decreases on both sides. Fatigue damage increases with increasing PAE, and the
fatigue damage caused by positive PAE is greater than that caused by negative PAE.
(4) When the PAE is within the range of −3◦to 3◦, the foundation fatigue damage
incurred over one year is minimal, but once this limit is exceeded, the foundation
fatigue damage increases dramatically. In particular, for more than 3◦positive PAE,
one year is enough to cause fatigue failure in the foundation concrete.
(5) The peak value of fatigue damage to the foundation concrete caused by PAE does not
necessarily occur in the main wind direction, but in the direction with the highest
probability of the occurrence of high wind speeds, and the larger the PAE, the more
significant the trend.
