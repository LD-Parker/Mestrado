Abstract  
This paper investigates from a structural reliability assessment  (SRA)  perspective the fatigue reliability 
using the S- N curve  approach com pared with  the fracture mechanics (FM)  approach for a typical welded 
offshore wind turbine ( OWT ) jacket support structure s. A non- intrusive formulation was developed for 
an OWT jacke t support structure in 50 m deep water , consisting of a sequence of steps. First, stochastic 
parametric 3D (three -dimensional) Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations are performed , taking  
into account stochastic variables such as wind loads, wave load s and soil properties using facilities 
within the software package ANSYS. Secondly, the FEA results are post-processed using an Artificial 
Neural Network (ANN) response surface modelling technique deriving  the performance functions 
expressed in terms of stochastic variables . Finally, the First Order Reliability Method (FORM) is  
applied in calculating the reliability index values  of components. T he developed framework  was applied  
to elucidate the fatigue damage process, including the small  to long crack transition  among other stages , 
for structural steel s used for  OWT jacket applications . The FM formulation investigated include s a 
crack growth formulation based on the bilinear crack growth law, considering both segments of the 
crack growth law as non- correlated and  correlated in calculating  the reliability index (RI).  Sensitivity 
analysis results showed a strong dependence of the structure's reliability levels on the uncertainties of 
the crack gro wth law constants  measured in terms of coefficient of variation (COV) . Also investigated, 
was the reliability of the structure reassessed and updated in the presence of assumed structural health 
monitoring/ condition monitoring ( SHM/CM) data. The results from the case stud y revealed that 
fracture reliability is highly sensitive to the initial crack size. It is recommended to apply the S -N curve 
method at the design stage while the FM approach applied towards the end of the design life  as the 
structure approaches failure.

1 Introduction 
By 2030, it was projected that a large contribution of wind energy capacity could come from offshore 
wind farms in the EU [1]. Offshore wind  farms are favo ured due to higher wind speeds, unrestricted 
space, and lower marine environment al impact  [2]. These co nditions have led to an increase in wind 
farm installations in Europe, particularly in the North Sea, Irish Sea and Baltic Sea. A complete  
offshore wind turbine ( OWT ) consists  of the wind turbine itself, installed on top of a support structure , 
which is  resting on a foundation that  is fixed  in the soil. There are a number of different types of

 support structures ; these are selected depending  on the water depth, the environmental loads, the cost 
of production and installation, complexity of the design, etc. [2 –4].  
A majority of  OWTs  use monopile foundations , especially when installed in water depths of less than 
50 m. But for larger wind turbines, monopiles become very large and impra ctical. Hence, space frame 
structures such as jackets are used instead, since they are more light -weight and stiffer than monopiles. 
Space frames can also be cheaper in deepwater circumstances. However, the design of space frames is  
time-consuming, especially if it is desired  to withstand a wide set of dynamic load s. Thus, more efforts 
are needed  to improve the design and analysis of jacket- type support structures [5,6], considering as 
well the  optimisation needed  to manufacture them in large volumes  [7,8]. 
To design offshore structures effectively, f atigue damage is an important limit state  criterion  to consider  
because materials with higher static strength  must now be introduced. Historically, the aircraft industry 
was the first to introduce fatigue as a cri terion for design, followed by other industries such as  nuclear, 
steel, offshore, and shipping. In the latter , the fatigue limit state (FLS) had to be explicitly defined, 
precisely because higher strength steels  were used in the design . Usually, the S- N data are first obtained 
from laboratory experiments , which serve as basis for the design criteria against fatigue failure . Besides 
good design, in -service inspection , maintenance and repair (IMR), is needed to keep adequate 
structural safety and system integrity during the service life. This has led to the  development of 
fracture mechanics (FM) and reliability -based methods to assess crack growth in any structure.  The 
FM approach is essential for  understanding the relationship between  different parameters and 
uncertainties involved in the fatigue damage process  [9]. 
S-N curve s have been  applied extensively to do fatigue design check s under complex loading conditions . 
Inspection and repair can , in addition to safeguarding against fatigue failure, be used to increase the 
reliability in view of crack growth.  More information about crack growth than obtained from S -N data 
are required in orde r to support inspection planning. Besides describing the gradual development of 
crack , the FM is also a potential tool which could account for the effect of structural health 
monitoring/condition monitoring (SHM/CM) data. As a result of  the inherent uncertainties of the crack 
growth method and data, reliability methods can be used to support subsequent decisions . Extensive 
studies on the effect of inspection and repair on the reliability of structures can be found in [9 –11]. T he 
application of the FM-based bi -linear crack growth law has been introduced for fatigue analysis  [12], 
which reduces the excessive conservatism believed to be implicit in the single slope Paris' law approach.  
Nowadays, s tructural design and analysis are based on  probabilistic - rather than deterministic -based 
methods , since the former  can account for  the uncertainties in the loads  and the models that relate them . 
A key driver of design is  the fact that a structure is expected to perform satisfactorily within its design 
life [21]. For an  OWT , this means that the OWT structure  must fulfil its function  reliably, and hence, 
must  not become unsafe , in general, over 25 years  [13]. Several studies [10,14–20]  have already applied 
the probabilistic -based structural reliability methods for the assessment of  offshore structures . However, 
most  studies assume that the system is time -invariant. In the reality , the system is actually time -variant  
due to the degradation brought by corrosion and fatigue as well as time-varying loads [21]. 
Models used in determining the response of OWT foundations could be classified into either the one-
dimensional (1- D) beam  models or three -dimensional (3- D) finite element analysis (FEA) models.  The 
3-D FEA models are preferable because they are able to simulate detailed stress distributions and 
accurately capture structural responses. Owing to their high fidelity the 3 -D FEA  models have been 
applied extensively to simulate wind turbine structures [16–18,21–27] , and hence, this study, will 
employ the FEA approach to model  the responses of the jacket foundations for OWTs  [21].

 It is important to take into account soil- pile interactio ns so as to adequately capture the structural 
response because OWT jacket support structures  are anchored via piles to the soil system . A simple  
approach  in perform ing soil modelling is to  use the p- y method, which  assume s the stiffness of the soil 
are represented by equivalent springs  [28]. However, a drawback of this method is that it underestimates 
the deflection  and the modal frequency. Defining 3 -D FEA brick elements is a more reliable way to 
perform soil modelling as this gives more accurate results  [29,30]. Due to  its high fidelity , the 3- D finite 
element analysis with brick elements is employed in modelling the soil  system  in this study [21] . 
The problem of optimising the CAPEX (capital expenditure) to OPEX (operating expenditure) ratio is 
an issue of priority for the offshore wind industry, and hence any cost reduction activities need to ensure 
safety and serviceability performance  [17] . By gathering and interpreting information from complex 
structures, it becomes possible to assess safety levels through probabilistic approaches, optimising 
maintenance strategies and facilitating  planning for critical repairs and retrofits. Advanced 
monitoring systems are now available at a lower cost, allowing the collection of loading and loading 
effects as well as structural response data. SHM and CM systems are designed to monitor such 
informa tion over a relatively long service period in order to distinguish anomalies, detect degradation 
and identify damage [17,31] . 
Artificial neural networks (ANNs)  are now  extensively used within the field of Structural Reliability 
Assessment (SRA) , as noted by several studies [32–35] , owing to their  universal function approximato r 
property. In ANNs , the relationship between input and output variables is established during an iterative 
training process  to facilitate the prediction of outputs given any input . According to [32], the most 
widely used ANN architecture is multi -layer feedforward network. ANNs can predict  highly nonlinear 
functions over the entire domain accurately [34]. Previous studies have already used  the response 
surface method based on ANN  [35] since it is more efficient compared with traditional  response surface 
methods for reliability assessment . In [32], it is claimed that this is especially true for complex 
structures, as long as appropriate feature selection techniques are employed [21,35]. 
Ziegler and Muskulus [36] , analysed crack growth on a Y- joint with simulations of structural response 
to aero - and hydrodynamic loading and Paris ' law for crack propagation. Several sources applied fatigue 
reliability assessment  methods for the design of offshore structures (i.e. in environments characterised 
by highly stochastic loads and resistance properties, thus necessitating the need for SRA to account for 
such uncertainties systematically) some of which include [7,8,10,11,16–18,20,21,26–28,37,37–39] . In 
[15], the fatigue reliability of fixed offshore platforms was investigated by analysing different failure 
scenarios. The Palmgren- Miner 's rule and S-N curve  were employed to estimate the accumulated fatigue 
damages in the limit state function (LSF). In [38], the fatigue life of welded tubular joints are estimated 
by using spectral fatigue damage approach. An LSF defined based on the Dirlik probabil ity density 
function, and the S-N curve  approach was developed. In [37] low cycle fatigue and crack growth 
reliability assessment  of an OWT  foundation during its design  life was performed. The analysis 
included different loading scenarios , and uncertain ties such as those related to geometric properties, 
defects,  among others  were taken into account in the study. In [40] , investigations conducted based on 
a reliability -based method to assess the structural integrity of offshore tubul ar joints were performed.  
According to [9] , to accurately evaluate the effect of an inspection and repair strategy of structures 
subjected to degradation resulting from crack growth, application of FM models are required to describe 
crack propagation. The reliability methods applied to account for inherent uncertainties with respect to 
selecting an optimal tool for making a proper decision, which enables a balance between design criteria, 
and inspection and repair plans include S -N and FM formulations. In [41,42] , a metho dology for the 
calculation of fatigue reliability (FR)  of universal join t in an articulated offshore tower was presented. 
It was reported  that the S -N curve approach yields a significantly conservative approximation of POF

 when compared to the FM approach. Dong et al., [10], performed the fatigue reliability of welded multi -
planar tubular joints of the support structure of a fixed jacket offshore wind turbine in a water dep th of 
70m. The S -N and FM approaches were applied  taking account of corrosion -induced crack growth rate  
via a general uniform corrosion model in the study [7,21]. 
A sub -category under this area is the damage tolerance approach for probabilistic pitting corrosion 
fatigue life prediction performed by [21,43] wherein comprehensive mechanistic- based probabilistic 
models for pitting corrosion fatigue life prediction by including all stages were presented, and the 
FORM was implemented with the proposed models. In [21], a generic reliability assessment framework 
that combines parametric FEA modelling, RSM, and reliability assessment specifically for complex 
nonlinear OWT jacket type support structures in the presence of highly stochastic variables, and ta king 
into consideration, specifically, time -dependent phenomena such as fatigue as well as degradation 
mechanisms such as corrosion was developed. Two ANNs were trained to relate various stochastic 
variables for predicting the performance function. The two ANNs were employed in order to have an 
intermediate predictor for a stochastic variable, which is more advantageous because of the added 
interpretability of results. An advantage of the proposed methodology is that the first ANN architecture enabled a sig nificant reduction in the computational cost, which would have been required to simulate 
global behaviour of the support structure thus allowing other global parameters to be incorporated.  
Other advantages of the developed non- intrusive formulation framewo rk include adequately accounting 
for 3D effects  whilst  modelling the fatigue crack growth behaviour as this enables us to further 
investigate properties difficult to study experimentally , among several other  advantages. This has been 
previously developed by the authors and will stand as the basis for the present study. 
This paper aims  to assess for the first time various fatigue reliability formulations using either S -N 
or FM approaches focusing on the  FM bi -linear crack growth law , with a view to compare their degree 
of conservativeness and application range.  Fatigue reliability analysis (FRA) of a typical tubular OWT 
was carried out, whose  jacket support structure is designed for a site with a water depth of 50 m . In the 
bilinear FM method , it is assumed  that both segments of the crack growth law are either correlated or 
uncorrelated in the calculation of the reliability index  (RI). An advanced reliability assessment of 
OWT jacket foundations is proposed through a combination of  reliabilit y analysis methods and assumed 
SHM/CM technology. A 3D stochastic parametric FEA model of OWT jacket foundations is developed, 
incorporating the effect of  soil-structure interactions. A series of stochastic FEA simulations of the 
OWT support structure is carried out , taking account of stochastic variables, such as wind loads, wave 
loads and soil properties. ANN -based response surface methodology (ANN -RSM ) is then used to post -
process the FEA results so that the performance functions are now expressed in te rms of the relevant 
stochastic variables. FORM (first -order reliability method) is then used to compute the reliability 
indices, evaluating the reliability of the OWT support structure  in manageable computation time. Then 
the reliability of the structure i s reassessed and updated,  in the presence of assumed SHM/CM data. 
Apart from enhanced accuracy, the updated reliability index will provide valuable information 
regarding making decisions pertaining to the inspection and maintenance of the structure.  
Part of this work involves  investigat ing the fatigue  reliability of the jacket reference support structure 
due to wind and wave loads as well as soil-structure interaction during the in-service life in the presence 
of assumed  SHM/CM technology data . It presents estimate s of the effects of other important random 
parameters on the reliability index by sensitivity studies . This is necessary in order to aid in the decision -
making  process to achieve  an optimal balance of the different safety measures via performing  design 
and planning for IMR at the design stage. A failure -critical hot -spot location where the most cumulative 
fatigue damage takes place is selected for use in the FRA .

 The remaining parts of this  paper are structured as follows. Section 2 presents a review of related 
literature; Section 3 presents  the basics of fatigue and fracture reliability assessments; Section 4  
presents the application of the methodology in a case study;  Section 5 presents the results and 
discussion, followed by the conclusion in Section 6.  
2 Basics of fatigue and fracture reliability assessment  
The basic failure probability in fatigue and fracture assessment may be defined by 
 𝑃𝑃𝑓𝑓=𝑃𝑃[𝑔𝑔(𝑡𝑡)≤0]=Φ(−𝛽𝛽) (1) 
where 𝑔𝑔(𝑡𝑡) is the limit state  function (LSF)  and 𝛽𝛽  is the safety  index. The case study  investigated  in the 
upcoming sections  is expressed in terms of the reliability index (RI). Φ is the standard normal distribution 
function  [44]. Probabilities  of failure  implied by Eq. ( 1) may be approximated  by means of widely used 
methods such as first -order reliability method (FORM), second- order reliability method (SORM) and 
Monte- Carlo simulation (MCS) techniques  [9,44].  
The FORM method incorporates a number of uncorrelated standard normal random variables. The 
original variables, which may, in general, be correlated and non- normal, are transformed to the u -
space using well -established transformations such as the Rosenblatt 's transformation. The exact 
failure  probability is the integral of the joint probability density function over the failure domain 
𝑔𝑔(𝑢𝑢)< 0. The first -order Taylor series expansion  of the limit state surface 𝑔𝑔(𝑢𝑢)= 0 is applied at the 
point with the shortest  distance from the origin in the u -space. A n RI, 𝛽𝛽 can be referred to  as the 
shortest  distance from the origin to the limit st ate surface in this space. The point of which the distance 
from the origin is minimum to the limit -state surface  denote s the worst combination of random 
variables and is th us called the design point or most probable failure point (MPP). The calculation  of 
the RI then becomes an optimi sation problem in locating  the MPP on the limit -state surface. The 
Rackwitz -Fiessler algorithm can be employed in recursively search ing for the MPP  [44–46]. After  
computing the RI, 𝛽𝛽 , the first -order approximation to the probability of failure can be determined by  
using the RHS Eq.  (1) [43]. This method is very simple to use, and has been  found to converge quickly 
in most cases.   
Fracture and f atigue are failure modes  of note for  welded offshore structures. Fatigue is a very local 
phenomenon, which is influenced by factors such as the  local geometry, and fabrication process-
induced weld defects. Crack propagation normally start s from weld defects and are driven by tensile, 
cyclic stresses. Cracks in jacket s are restricted  to the tubular joints as a result of  the large stress 
concentration in such joints [10]. 
2.1 S-N curve approach 
Herein , FRA was performed  according  to the fatigue analysis procedure described  in the DNV standard 
[47,48]. Consequently , the thickness -corrected D curve given by DNV -OS-J101 [48] is chosen for  S-N 
curve approach to fatigue analysis.  The intercept (A) and slope (m) of the S- N curve  assumed for 
evaluating  the fatigue life of steel structure in seawater is given as 15.606 and 5, respectively.  
2.2 Fracture mechanics approach  
2.2.1 Fracture mechanics analysis of planar flaws  
Fatigue reliability is often based on an FM approach given by the Paris ' crack propagation law [9]. As 
set out in  the BS 7910 [12] , there are two methods  outlined for the assessment of planar flaws both 
based on FM  crack analysis under fatigue loading which consists of  a general procedure and a simplified

 procedure related to  S-N curve s. In these methods, t he fatigue life is calculated by integrati ng the crack 
growth law. T he general procedure enables the cyclic stress intensity  factor expressed accurately to be 
employed as well as specific data for fatigue crack growth. The quality category procedure entails  the 
use of FM  calculation results which have already been carried out and presented  graphically. 
Th
e FM assessment usually employ s conservative estimates of the various parameters required. 
However, it is imperative to use an alternative approach by applying reliability methods to take into 
account  the randomness in the parameter s. It is often assumed that a flaw is a crack with a sharp tip and 
its propagation is governed by the law related to crack growth rate , 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑/𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑, and stress intensity factor 
range, ∆𝐾𝐾, for a material containing  flaws. The crack growth law  is empirical and normally depicted 
that a sigmoid curve cane can be used to represent the overall relationship between 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 /𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 and ∆𝐾𝐾 in 
a 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑔𝑔(𝑑𝑑
𝑑𝑑/𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑) versus 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑔𝑔(∆𝐾𝐾) pl
ot. It is reasonable to assume that the central portion of the plot 
follows a linear relationship (i.e. the Paris ' law), or to represent the data by two or more straight lines 
to achieve greater accuracy. The crack growth rate is insignificant at low values of ∆𝐾𝐾 below the 
threshold stress intensity factor range, ∆𝐾𝐾0. There is a rapid acceleration in the crack growth rate as the 
maximum stress intensity factor 𝐾𝐾 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚, at high values of ∆𝐾𝐾  tends toward the critical stress intensity 
factor for static load failure, 𝐾𝐾 𝑐𝑐. However, the assumption that the central portion is applicable to  all 
∆𝐾𝐾 values (from ∆𝐾𝐾0 up to failure) is valid. The Paris' law equation is expressed as [12,49,50]: 
 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑=𝐶𝐶(∆𝐾𝐾)𝑚𝑚 (2) 
w
here C and m are material coefficients and also depend on environmental effects. For ∆𝐾𝐾<∆𝐾𝐾0, 
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑/𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 is assumed to be zero. The stress intensity factor range, ∆𝐾𝐾 , is a function of geometry, 𝑌𝑌, stress 
range, ∆𝜎𝜎, and instantaneous crack size, 𝑑𝑑, a
nd is calculated from the following equation: 
 ∆𝐾𝐾=𝑌𝑌(∆𝜎𝜎)�(𝜋𝜋 𝑑𝑑) (3) 
The overall life is calculated by substituting Eq. ( 3) into Eq. ( 2) and integrating the following equation 
[21]: 
 �𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
𝑌𝑌𝑚𝑚(𝜋𝜋𝑑𝑑)𝑚𝑚/2𝑚𝑚𝑓𝑓
𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖=𝐶𝐶(∆𝜎𝜎)𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑 (4) 
In BS7910 [12], the application  of the bi- linear crack growth law for the fatigue assessment of welded 
structures is recommended . According to [9] , a comprehensive data collection from several  sources 
was carried out , and a crack growth law  having two segments was recommended for steel  structures . 
Different uncertainties in both segments of the crack growth law were reported with the (lower) near -
threshold segment having the largest variability. Th e larger variability  may be due to the proximity to 
the small -crack regime  and hence the  inher ent uncertainty of the  ∆𝐾𝐾 threshold whereby the material 
experiences no crack growth  below this . In contrast,  the upper segment has lower uncertainty because  
the crack growth rates behavio ur is well inside the stable region with high values of  ∆𝐾𝐾. However, 
there is a lack  of information on the degree of correlation between the two segments. According to [9] , 
some studies assumed that the two crack growth law segments  are uncorrelated. The effect of 
correlation in failure probability is investigated herein . 
2.2.2 SMART© fracture  
Simulation s based on f racture  has relied on two models: conventional cohesive zone modelling (CZM) 
and, of recent , the eXtended Finite Element Metho d (XFEM). The CZM is most appropriate for the 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
[Type here]  
 
7 
 simulation of de -bonding of adhesively attached surfaces. The CZM is commonly applied for simulating 
composites, but it is not ideal for simulating  the crack growth in the bulk of a material [51] . 
The XFEM performs better when simulating internal crack s. As packaged in the ANSYS toolkit, in the 
XFEM , the need for re-meshing regions near the crack tip  is eliminated . Instead, an extended finite 
element enrichment area is defined  near crack tip regions where it is most likely that the crack 
propagates. In the  XFEM , the special volume elements in the enrichment zone are split  from its centre. 
Hence, a finer mesh  is generated  by splitting existing cells rather than  re-meshing. However, a drawback 
of the XFEM is in its inability to limit the enrichment regions  as it increases , ther eby making it  
computationally costly , and as  such, the simulation becomes time -consuming. Therefore , it is difficult 
to scale up the XFEM to large projects , and this  led to the development of the SMART© fracture  tool.  
The Separating Morphing and Adaptive Re-meshing Technology, SMART© relies on the Unstructured 
Mesh Method (UMM) process. In the SMART© as a result of automatic crack propagation at each 
solution step, the mesh is being updated from crack -geometry changes. This function is as packaged in 
the ANSYS R19  facility . Rather than applying  the enrichment technique, it employs a locali sed re-mesh 
function as the crack propagates . Unlike the XFEM, an advantage of the SMART©  is that it enables the 
simulation to be scaled up for larger projects as a result of its property of limit ing the re-mesh to a small 
area near  the crack tip at each iteration. An other  advantage  of this technique is that  the development  of 
new elements is not required and default/ standard elements included already  in mechanical, such as the 
conventional solid 187, 186, etc. can still be applied . Also , the software permits  designers to enter 
alternative crack growth laws as these emerge from new research ab out the particular material being 
modelled. Further information on the characteristics of the SMART© fracture can be found in [21] .  
The SMART fracture © method is applied in calculating the stress intensity factor range and crack 
extension. The accuracy and scientific soundness of the SMART fracture© tool was demonstrated  by 
the same authors in other studies [7,21] using a similar purpose- developed model to that  employed in 
the current study through a validation exercise which involved comparing the fatigue crack growth rate 
(FCGR ) prediction of this tool with experimental data  of the same test set -up, among others . 
2.3 Limit state function based on the S-N curve approach 
Significant cyclic loads induced by the environment are imposed on OWT jackets making their design 
to be driven by FLS . The FLS assessments can be performed by applying two methods, i.e. S- N curve  
method and FM  method. According to the S-N curve method, the number of loading cycles to failure, 
N, can be determined from  [26]: 
 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑔𝑔𝑑𝑑=𝐴𝐴−𝑚𝑚𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑔𝑔∆𝑆𝑆 (5 ) 
where A and m are the intercept, and the slope of the S-N curve  on the log -log plot, respectively, and 
∆S is the  stress range. Design standards, e.g. DNVGL -ST-0126, generally prescribe the intercept A and 
slope m. The limit state  function of FRA  based on the S-N curve  approach can be determined from  
[17,52]: 
 𝑔𝑔𝑓𝑓,𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆=𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑔𝑔𝑑𝑑−𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑔𝑔𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡 (6 ) 
where subscripts f  and SN represents the FLS, and S-N curve  approach , respectively; N is the number 
of loading cycles to failure as obtained from  Eq. ( 5
), Nt is the number of loading cycles expected during 
the given design life. Nt can be calculated  by using rated rotor speed 𝑛𝑛𝑟𝑟𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 𝑟𝑟  and availability 𝜂𝜂 𝑚𝑚 (98.5%) 
on the site selected  [25,53]. Hence, assuming  a design life  of 24 years, the number of cycles is given 
as: 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
[Type here]  
 
8 
  𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡=𝜂𝜂𝑚𝑚.𝑛𝑛𝑟𝑟𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 𝑟𝑟 ×(24[𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑑𝑑 𝑎𝑎]×365 [𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑦𝑦/𝑦𝑦 𝑦𝑦𝑑𝑑 𝑎𝑎]×2 4[ℎ𝑙𝑙𝑢𝑢 𝑎𝑎/𝑑𝑑 𝑑𝑑 𝑦𝑦]
×6
0[𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚
𝑛𝑛/ℎ𝑙𝑙𝑢𝑢
𝑎𝑎]) (7) 
For the calculation of the fatigue RI across the nominal service life of the asset, a quasi -static approach 
is assumed, where the annual reliability index can be calculated and plotted accordingly for the 24 years 
of consideration. 
2.4 Limit state function based on fracture mechanics approach  
Compared to the S-N curve method, the FM method is more detailed and involves evaluating crack 
growth. 
The failure function for fatigue as a function of time can be written as 𝑔𝑔(𝑡𝑡)=𝑑𝑑𝑓𝑓−𝑑𝑑(𝑡𝑡). 
T
he performance function for FRA based on LEFM is given by: 
 
𝑔𝑔𝑓𝑓,𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹=�1
𝑌𝑌(𝑑𝑑)𝑚𝑚�√𝜋𝜋𝑑𝑑�𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑−𝐶𝐶∆𝑆𝑆𝑚𝑚(𝑑𝑑(𝑡𝑡)−𝑑𝑑𝑜𝑜)𝑚𝑚𝑐𝑐
𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑜 (8) 
where subscript f and FM represents  the fatigue limit state and FM  approach, respectively; ao is the 
initial crack depth (or the crack depth at time t 0); ac is the critical crack depth; Y(a)  is the compliance 
function ; m and C are material constants; N(t)  is the total number of stress cycles in the time period 
[t0, t]; and No is the initial number of stress cycles.  
According to [36] , the FM approach is more complex than the S-N curve  design , which increases the 
risk of gross errors.  In this study, it is assumed that t he errors due to the complexity of the FM approach 
may be reduced as a result of using the ANSYS SMART  Fracture©  FEA  facility . Hen ce, in this study, 
owing to the high-fidelity  of the FEA model , it was assumed that this has accounted for  model 
uncertaint ies which may exist due to errors if  analytical calculations  were to be used . The Non- intrusive 
formulation used herein  enables  an enhance d analysis leading to more accurate results as it utilises the 
3D simulation  method as established in [21]. 
3 Application using a case study  
3.1 Design considerations for OWT support structures  
The reference  case adopted  for this analysis includes a baseline 10MW National Renewable Energy 
Laboratory, NREL wind turbine with  wind speed  of the site  as 20 m/s , attached to  an 88.4 m tower, a 
transition piece (TP) and is supported by a jacket foundation. The jacket is a vertical height of 66 m, 
and the  structure is anchored by pile embedded 42  m into the soil  system  and submerged  into 50 m deep 
water . The piles feature a batter angle as they are to be driven through the legs. The TP  is 7 m in length 
and connects together the jacket and the tower [5,6] . The OWT jacket support structure was modelled 
in the  ANSYS  workbench environment , which is well-established  FEA software [26]. The schem atic of 
the jacket wind turbine is , as shown in Figure 1. See also Figure 2 and Ref. [7]  for more details . In the 
present  study, the normal operating condition of the wind turbine  is considered mainly , which is also defined 
as the design load case, DLC 1.2 in IEC 61400- 3. The wind and wave forces  are simulated to always assume 
the same direction, and all sea states considered to be in only one direction, such that  the results of the long -
term fatigue loads should be conserva tive. This is a simplified assumption  of the DLC 1.2 as outlined in IEC 
61400 -3.

 3.1.1 Parametric modelling of OWT jacket support structures:  Geometry, materials,  
structural components and soil profile  
The tower, TP, jacket, and piles  are assumed to be made of S355 steel having  Young's modulus of 210 
GPa,  density of 8500 𝑘𝑘𝑔𝑔/𝑚𝑚3, and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3 [5,6].  Besides  the OWT foundation, another 
design factor of note that could impact  the structural response model  of the pile -jacket -tower assembly  
is the soil -structure interaction. In order to enhance the a ccuracy of results calculated , the soil -structure 
interaction aspects are incorporated in the present study [54]. Hence, the soil profile as simulated  herein 
is based on data which corresponds to a K -13 deepwater site located off the coast of Netherlands. Six 
layers of sand representing the soil profile and their corresponding parameters  based on site 
measurements are entered into the simulation as deri ved from [5,21,26] . The soil system is modelled to 
have a  cylindrical shape (D=140  m, H=50 m) consisting  of six different strata in ANSYS. The Drucker -
Prager Strength Linear model is assumed to describe the behaviour of  the soil material [55]. This model 
is used to cal culate the yield stress of each soil strata. The yield strength  of the soil , 𝜎𝜎𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦, according to  
the Drucker- Prager model, can be calculated from : 
 𝜎𝜎𝑦𝑦,𝑦𝑦=6𝑐𝑐cos𝜙𝜙
√3(3−sin𝜙𝜙) (9) 
where, 𝜙𝜙 represents the angle of internal friction and the cohesion value is represented by 𝑐𝑐. The 
coefficient of friction between the soil and the pile , 𝐶𝐶𝑓𝑓 can be calculated from  [29].  
 𝐶𝐶𝑓𝑓=tan�2

3.1.2 Mesh sensitivity analysis  
A critical  step which affects the performance of an  FEA is the mesh generation. The ANSYS software 
package provides a reliable and powerful structure mesh generator  with the capab ility of generating a 
consistent mesh in the whole  structure with  a minimal computational requirement. A mesh sensitivity 
analysis was conducted for optimising the element size , thereby enhanc ing the precision  of results. The 
results are presented in  Table 1. Based on the mesh sensitivity analysis result s, the Von- Mises 
(equivalent) stress converged at the soil element size of 2m and support structure element size at 0.5m, 
which corresponds to a total number of elements  of 190,222. Similarly, the  mesh convergence test  was 
performed with respect to the RI  for the developed non- intrusive method and sim ilar results were 
obtained with the RI converging at the same element size  as achieved in the foregoing. The display of 
the optimised mesh  for the support structure  as simulated in ANSYS  is depicted in  Figure 3.

3.1.3 Validation  
In order to validate the structural model developed, the results of the deflection in static analysis and 
modal analysis for the support structure against data from the reference OWT [26]. Results of the modal 
analysis and deflection are depicted  in Figure 4, and Figure 5 and their comparison can be seen  in Table 
2 and Table 3, which shows that the  model approximately predicts the  first eigen -frequency to the 3P 
frequency of the rotor. Moreover, the relative difference  between the present study and as  obtained from 
references is 0.12% as the eigen -frequency calculated is 0.21346 [6,56] . Also, the deformation  at the  
elevation of the  rotor-nacelle assembly  (RNA) and the base of the tower is 1.236 m and 1. 6085 ×10−1, 
representing - 0.46% and - 3.44% relative difference  between the present model and as obtained in the 
reference [6]. These differences are considered to be acceptable.

3.1.4 Calculation of loads on OWT support structures   
In th e present  study, the normal operating conditions are assumed to represent the environmental 
conditions for the FLS design approach adopted. The wind, w ave, and current loads are manually 
calculated and then entered  in the parametric FEA model.  
According to the IEC 61400-1 [57] , the normal wind climate conditions assumed  in the present  study 
are consid ered to be cyclic structural loading conditions and are calculated as th us: 
 
𝑉𝑉(ℎ)=𝑉𝑉𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓ln�ℎ
𝑧𝑧0�
ln�ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓
𝑧𝑧0� (11) 
where 𝑧𝑧0 is the roughness coefficient (see [48]). After generating the wind speed profile, the horizontal 
load exerted on the tower, TP and nacelle can be expressed as : 
 𝐹𝐹𝑚𝑚=1
2𝐶𝐶𝐷𝐷𝜌𝜌𝑟𝑟(𝑉𝑉𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚)2𝐴𝐴cos𝛼𝛼 (12) 
where 𝐶𝐶𝐷𝐷 is the cylindrical drag coefficient (for the tower and TP) and plate drag coefficient (for the 
nacelle), A is the area being pushed by the wind, and 𝛼𝛼  is the inclination angle of the wind with the 
horizontal axis. The effects of the b lades are not taken into account in this study.  
M
orrison' s equation  is employed in the calculation  of the wave forces. The equation is constituted of 
the drag and inertia terms, where the drag identified by the drag coefficient 𝐶𝐶𝑟𝑟, and the inertia identified 
by the i nertia coefficient 𝐶𝐶 𝑚𝑚 [58]. Morrison 's equation can be expressed as: 
 𝐹𝐹=𝐹𝐹𝑟𝑟+𝐹𝐹𝑚𝑚=1
2𝜌𝜌𝑤𝑤𝐶𝐶𝑟𝑟𝐷𝐷|𝑢𝑢𝑚𝑚|𝑢𝑢𝑚𝑚+𝜌𝜌𝑤𝑤𝐶𝐶𝑚𝑚𝜋𝜋𝐷𝐷2
4𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡 (13) 
where U is the undisturbed fluid velocity, 𝑟𝑟𝑑𝑑
𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 is the acceleration of the fluid, 𝜌𝜌𝑤𝑤 is the water density, 
and D is the diameter of the cylinder. T he wave profile data such as water levels and wave data of 
interest for the K -13 deepwater site derived from [7] was used in the current study . In terms of the 
structural integrity, e nvironmental loads, such as the tidal currents and wind- driven currents, are not 
significant threats  in shallow -water  circumstances. However, the se can contribute to other significant 
excitations such as those gener ated by the wind and waves. The tidal current profile at distance z from 
still water level can be denoted by t he current speed �𝜐𝜐(𝑧𝑧)�. The current speed variation from the current 
at the still water  level  𝜐𝜐0 through the distance to the topwater column can be described exponentially.  
This is expressed as:  
 
𝜐𝜐(𝑧𝑧)=𝜐𝜐0�ℎ+𝑧𝑧
ℎ�1
7
 𝑓𝑓𝑙𝑙𝑎𝑎 𝑧𝑧 ≥ 0  (14) 
where ℎ is the  water  depth . The extreme tidal current is assumed to occur  at approximately the  mean 
water level, with zero tidal currents a t high and low tide. Having obtained the tidal current profile, the 
assumption of a constant over depth current will be made . Wind- driven currents occur due to the action

 of shear forces on the water surface resulting from  wind and thus, are  likely to act in a similar direction 
with the wind. According to IEC61400-3, t he sea surface wind -driven current can be estimated from :

T
he submerged parts of the jacket are subjected to a water column pressure referred  to as the h ydrostatic 
pressure.  This can be calculated via a control volume analysis of an infinitesimally small cube of fluid , 
assuming a constant gravity and density through depth. Hence,  
 𝑝𝑝(𝑧𝑧)−𝑝𝑝(𝑧𝑧0)=1

w
here 𝑝𝑝 (𝑧𝑧) is the pressure at a given height z, 𝑝𝑝(𝑧𝑧0) is the pressure at 𝑧𝑧0, which is the top of the water 
column, Therefore, 𝑝𝑝 (𝑧𝑧0)=𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚, 𝜌𝜌 is the water density (𝑘𝑘𝑔𝑔/𝑚𝑚3), 𝑔𝑔 is gravity ( 𝑚𝑚/𝑠𝑠2), ℎ=(𝑧𝑧−𝑧𝑧0) is 
the liquid column  height measured from the test volume to the zero reference point of pressure.  
Th
e rotor and nacelle are assumed to be concentrated or distributed masses as modelled in the FEA. 
Hence,  the hub and blades are excluded from the parametric model. According to [54], modelling the 
blades will not be necessary since, besides the added mass acting on the tower top, the parked and 
feathered blades do not have a significant effect on the eigen -frequency of OWTs. The  weight of the  
Rotor Nacelle Assembly (RNA) is assumed to be 10516 kN . A single  horizontal axis  wind turbine 
sustained by  a jacket substructure is assumed  in the present  paper . Hence, this study does not cover  
wake effects associated with  wind farm  sites. Effective turbulence models are crucial  in consider ing 
wake effects on fatigue reliability of OWT  components in wind farms . More details on this  can be found 
in [59]. A well -suited option to capture the most important nonlinear contributions from  the blades , 
generators, etc.  is the use of aero -servo -elastic codes such as GH BLADED, openFAST, FLEX5 and 
HAWC2 . This is expected to produce more accurate fatigue reliability estimation but may be achieved 
at the expense of high computational requirements [60] . 
The widely used standard,  DNV- OS-J101 prescribes guidelines to assess the structural integrity of 
OWT  support structures . As set -out therein, during design, OWT support structures should be checked 
against four limit states FLS, Ultimate Limit States (ULS), Serviceability Limit State (SLS) , and 
Accidental Limit State (ALS) . According to several sources, fatigue is the design driving criteria for 
most components of OWTs,  and this study will  focus on the FLS [10,16] . Further description of limit 
state design can be found in [3, 6, 18, 50]. 
3.2 OWT support structure having flaws and subjected to fatigue 
3.2.1 Parametric FEA  
In th is subsection , a parametric FEA model of the three -dimensional space frame, tower and pile 
assembly (as shown in Figure 2), the jacket configuration, and the sources of loads are presented . The 
present study is based on analysis already  carried out in [21,26]. In the upcoming sections, the FM ANN 
architectures are used to approximate the performance by linking the input parameters with the output, 
the stress range. The parametric FEA  developed for this study is presented below. 
Fatigue damage can  be assumed to initiate from the weld toe of a critical tubular multi- planar welded 
joint, and a section containing the initial crack can be  extracted for the stochastic parametric FEA at 
local scale according to Refs. [7,12,21,48]. Initial flaws/ cracks  can also be assumed to initiate  as a 
result of  welding/ manufacturing imperfection . Thus, a section at this location  is modelled in the form 
of a curved plate within which the crack is located.  This is performed  so as  to limit computational 
time/cost to practical levels , among other advantages.

 The FEA model developed by the authors  in [26]  is adopted to calculate  the equivalent stress at the 
vicinity of the crack , and this  result is assumed to be exerted  on the plate (see  Figure 6 and Figure 7). 
The Equivalent stress imposed on the plate as modelled was determined to be 58.63 MPa [21].

3.3 Structural reliability assessment (SRA) of the OWT support structure 
In this section, the SRA of the OWT suppor t structure using first, the S- N curve  approach and then 
second for the FM approach assuming the structure is subjected to f atigue is carried out  based on the 
damage- tolerance approach  both considering FLS  as set -out in  DNV- OS-J101 [48] . The fully 
parametric FEA model presented in Section 3.1.1 and Section  3.2.1 is employed in carrying out  FEA

 modelling, accounting for stochastic variables, for the S-N curve  and FM approach respectively. The n 
all results  generated  are then post -processed using  a developed non- intrusive formulation.  
3.3.1 Stochastic variables and FEA  
The stochastic variables considered in this study are presented in Table 4 for the S- N curve  approach 
and the FM approach , assuming the bilinear FM model . Seventeen (17) stochastic variables were 
considered for both methods. Ten stochastic variables were considered f or the first ANN, and this  set-
up was  arrived at as described in [61]: Initially, these  included the  thrust forc e, hydrodynamic load,  
torsional moment,  tilting moment, the weight of RNA, and three young moduli at three soil strata. The 
total hydrodynamic load was considered differently due to  its dependence on the wave period , wave 
height, and current speed. To calc ulate  the peak hydrodynamic force acting on the system the significant 
wave height  and the current speed were assumed to follow  a Weibull distribution , while the  wave period 
was assumed to follow a lognormal distribution [3, 59, 60]. The total hydrodynamic load was  then fitted 
into a Weibull -equivalent distribution. Distribution fitting algorithms (such as Akaike Information 
Criterion, Bayesian Information Criterion and Kolmogorov- Smirnov) are often applied to determine  the 
shape coefficients of the most suitable  statistical distributions , in the presence of observed data [18]. In 
the present study, the wind speed, significant wave height, wave period, and the current speed are 
reintroduced into the stochastic model and the equations incorporated in the LSF model of the FORM 
on implementation of the SR A.

For both cases ( i.e. assuming the S- N curve  and FM approaches) , after determining which variables are 
to be designated  stochastic, a series of stochastic parametric  FEA modelling of the OWT foundation 
was carried out  adopting the FEA model developed in Section  3 using the Design of Experiments (DoE) 
function as packaged in  ANSYS  DesignXplorer . This enables the various input parameters to be 
designated as stochastic with each assuming  different distributions. DoE allows  the generation of output 
parameter corresponding to the different design points  as they are being varied . 
3.3.2 Non-intrusive formulation  
For both approaches, having defined the stochastic parameters, the performance function (PF) is 
determined. For example , for the FM approach , the PF  is determined by substituting the small crack 
regime life and long crack regime life into the FLS Equation as established in [21] . The resulting safety 
margin  can be calculated from  Eq. ( 17). The frequency is fixed at 0.21  Hz as derived from Ref. [5].  
Subsequently, the FORM is applied in estimating  the fatigue  reliability index.

Figure 8 depicts a flow chart of the developed non- intrusive formulation for the FM approach  used 
herein . The algorithm  begins by  defining the system, the FLS and the stochastic variables in the analys is. 
Next, a series of FEA simulations in ANSYS  is executed by varying the inputs and recording the outputs 
corresponding to the  limit state. The FEA simulations are varied using the ANSYS DoE package via 
the Latin Hypercube Sampling technique . Theoretical details of ANSYS DesignXplorer© can be found 
in Ref. [26,67,68]. In this study, the generated data sets from ANSYS are then used to train artificial 
neural networks (ANN) in order to map the structural response over the domain of stochastic variables. 
Finally, the RI is calculated  using the FORM , which has been entirely implemented by the authors in 
MATLAB . The steps detailed in the foregoing should be followed in a recursive process calcu lating the 
annual reliabilities  and hence the reliability for different time periods can be quantified in a quasi -static 
way. The iterative FORM algorithm has been validated against the MCS in previous studies [21,26]. 
The well-established FORM is used as it  offers a good bal ance between efficiency and accuracy for 
realistic problems. One  limitation of the MCS  method is that many simulations are  required  to calculate  
the very low values of failure  probability, which is a characteristic of complex offshore structures [26] . 
Considering the time required, the stochastic parametric FEA simulation runs for about 5 minutes  on a 
high- performance computer while the ANN- based RSM and FORM runs instantly.

We now  give further details to the ANN -based RSM, as follows. Two ANNs are  used to predict  the 
performance function  using the stochastic variables as input. As shown in Figure 9, the first ANN aims 
to predict the applied stress range, while the second ANN aims to predict the stress intensity factor 
range and the crack extension. The architecture, the training, and tes ting results of these ANNs are the 
same as those provided in Ref.  [21]. The results for training these ANNs reported  high accuracy with 
the R -square value of more than 99%  during both training and testing. This means that the trained ANNs  
match well with the FEA results  indicating its success , and hence,  are reliable predictors of the target

 variables for subsequent structural reliability analysis.  The readers may refer to Table 4 for a summary 
of the variables involved. Having obtained the performance function from the ANN, the FORM is used 
to calculate the reliability index 𝛽𝛽 using the HL -RF algorithm developed by the authors  as described in 
[21,26,61].  
4 Results and discussion  
From the fatigue reliability index curve for the S- N curve  method, it can be observed that the structure 
maintains a reliability index exceeding the defined threshold of target reliability as specified by DNV 
for the nominal 24 years of operation of the structure as shown in Figure 10. When the fatigue reliability 
over time is estimated, the inspection activities then need to be scheduled. In order to determine the times for IMR, a reliability index threshold for the inspection need to be identified. According to 
DNVGL standard [30], the target reliability index of OWT support structures is 3.71. Therefore, 3.71 
is taken as the reliability index threshold in this study.

Figure 11. Fatigue reliability analysis assuming different levels of correlation between stochastic variables  
 
4.1 Fatigue SRA results 
A study is performed  using the S -N curve method to examine the correlation effect s of random variables 
on the reliability of the structure.  The variables considered correlated are the wind speed and 
aerodynamic effects, then the wind speed, significant wave height,  and wave period, and then the 
different Young moduli of the soils , simultane ously . The estimated reliability indices as they vary with 
the variation in correlation is depicted in Figure 11. As can  be inferred from the figure, as the correlation 
between the stochastic parameters increases the reliability indices calculated decreases. Hence, t his 
implies  a negative correlation  and the RI is sensitive to the percentage correlation.     
Fatigue reliability assessment was carried out employing the  FM modelling approach, and the results 
are presented in  Figure 12 . It can be inferred that the structure failed the  defined  criteria after the year 
9.65 as th e reliability index 𝛽𝛽  will fall below  the defined threshold value of 𝛽𝛽= 3. 71 [16–18,63].  
4.2 Comparison between the S-N curve and FM approaches 
From  Figure 13, it can be observed that at year 2 in the S-N curve approach, the 𝛽𝛽= 5. 79 while in the 
FM-approach 𝛽𝛽= 8. 15. Also, it can be seen that both curve s intersect at year 7.05 when 𝛽𝛽= 5 whereas, 
at year 24 for the S-N curve  approach, 𝛽𝛽= 4. 21 while for the FM approach, 𝛽𝛽= 1. 24. Hence, the 
structural reliability prediction produced following the S-N curve  method gave conservative results 
compared to that produced using the FM approach  at the start o f the service life of the structure , but 
towards the end of the design life , the results may be overly optimistic. From the foregoing, we can 
establish that in terms of safety , it is better to apply the FM approach in the subsequent fatigue reliability 
assessments presented in the upcoming sections.

4.3 Sensitivity studies  
The results of a sensitivity analysis to the fatigue reliability performed on the structure by varying 
different parameters is depicted in Figure 14  to Figure 21. This depicts the most critical FM parameters 
that have a drastic impact on the response and reliability performance of the support structure. 
According to [9], apart from uncertainties in the Paris ' law parameter 𝐶𝐶, other parameters of note of 
which their uncertainties often have significant impact on the fatigue reliability of welded components 
include the uncertainties in the crack initiation period, the initial crack size as well as in the crack 
aspect ratio development. It is argued  therein , however, that  due to the large number of microscopical 
defects introduced whilst the  welding process as well as the stress raising effect of the geometry of 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

22 
 the weld itself , the initiation time in welded structures is rela tively small (10 –15% of the total fatigue 
life). Hence, the initiation time is neglected herein , which is also a conservative assumption. In 
addition, it is assumed that corrosion -fatigue mechanism takes place, according to several studies 
[21,65,69–73]. 
According to the data provided in the BS7910 [12] , the uncertainties of the crack growth law 
constant  𝐶𝐶 which correspond s to the lower segment are larger than that of the upper segment. As 
a result of  both the inherent uncertainty in the behavior of very small crack propagation  and the 
difficulty of carrying out measurements of  such rates in the tests , this  also entails that the near -
threshold crack growth rates have an impact . In addition, there is insufficient  information with 
respect to  the level  of correlation which exists  between both segments. This will have  an impact 
on the RI results as  calculat ed. The effect of c orrelation between 𝐶𝐶1 and 𝐶𝐶2 are analys ed, as shown 
in Figure 14 :  
As can be observed the effect of variation in the correlation is pronounced at around year s 6 and 8 
of the operation of the structure. At this region of the FRA curves , the reliability index values 
decrease with an increase in the assumed correlation. It can be said that this may be at the small 
crack -to-long crack transition period.  In other words, the reliability index curves diverge  at the 
beginning  (at the year 6 to be precise ) and converge towards the end of the ser vice life  as the 
percentage correlation is increased  correspondingly for the FM approach.  As can also be seen  from the 
same figure,  with respect to the RI threshold based on the fatigue reliability curve having no correlation, 
30% correlation, 60% correlation, and 90% correlation, the structure fails the defined criteria after the 
year 9.65, 9.43, 9.10, and 8.48 respectively. This indicates that correlation between the Paris ' law 
constant s assuming the bilinear FM model has a significant impact on the predicted fatigue RI.

It is crucial  to emphasi se that in the context of a bi linear FM law in seawater circumstances, 
majority of the propagation of surface cracks is affected  by the uncertainties associated with  the 
near-threshold rate of crack growth . For through -thickness cracks, the propagation is driven by

 larger crack growth rates far away from the influence of the uncertainties inherent to the knuckle 
of both slopes. The case study in this paper considers only surface cracks.  
 
Figure 15. Fatigue reliability assessment using the bilinear FM model at different COV values of 𝐶𝐶 1  
In the sensitivity studies presented in the following s, the correlated  FM model is used, which is 
believed to represent most appropriately the bi -linear FM probabi listic formulation.  In Figure 15 
for the bilinear FM model,  as the uncertainty measured in terms of coefficient of variation ( COV) in 
Paris ' law constant 𝐶𝐶1 increases, there is corresponding continuous decrease in the RI magnitude  
initially , which converges at the 10th year. Figure 16 shows that as the uncertainty, mea sured in terms 
of COV in Paris constant 𝐶𝐶2 increases, there is corresponding continuous decrease in the RI magnitude 
between years six  and the year 22. As the COVs are increased there is no observed change at year 2 , 
but the curves diverge at year four and then later converges at year 24. In Figure 17, the COVs of both 
terms 𝐶𝐶1 and 𝐶𝐶2 are increased simultaneously  and it is observed that there is corresponding decrease 
in the RI value initially but the curves converge to the same RI at the end of the service life of the 
structure.  Also , Figure 16 and Figure 17 depict  that a change in the value of the variation coefficient  
affects the time to failure/ inspection time for the structure.

In this study, of interest is t h e initial size of a surface crack in a welded joint  assumed to be  induced by 
the welding procedure itself. The initial crack size, in principle, may be referred to as the depth (or 
length) from which the nucleation of a flaw from surface defects  has occu rred and will grow under the 
stable crack propagation regime until a final crack size or fracture.  The probabilistic sensitivity factor 
(𝛼𝛼) is used to quantify the i nfluence of the initial crack size, 
𝑑𝑑𝑤𝑤 as shown in F igure 18 and Figure 19. 
According to [43], these are obtained as the components of the unit gradient vector at the MPP of the 
limit state in the standard normal space.  As can be seen in Figure 18
, as the mean value of the 𝑑𝑑𝑤𝑤 
increases there is corresponding decrease in the value of the  𝛼𝛼. At the 6th year of the operation of the 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
[Type here]  
 
25 
 st
ructure, the curves are observed to be converging  after which an increase in the value of 𝑑𝑑𝑤𝑤 leads to 
slight increase in the  magnitude of 𝛼𝛼. The curve finally converge in the year 10 where there is no 
observed change in the magnitude of 𝛼𝛼 as the mean value of 𝑑𝑑𝑤𝑤 is changed. Also, from Figure 19  a 
similar behavior is observed  to the foregoing but this time a decrease in the COV leads to corresponding 
decrease in the magnitude of the 𝛼𝛼 with the curves tending to converge as we are app roaching the year 
6. Hence, it can be inferred that the performance function by applying the FM approach is sensitive to 
the mean and COV of the 𝑑𝑑𝑤𝑤 at the beginning of the service life of the structure.  
These 
results show that it is not only the mean value of stochastic variables that control the reliability 
or safety of the structure, but COV also plays a significant role in determining the structure's reliability 
or safety .  This study may prove to be efficient for optimisation and improvement of design.

 4.4 Reassessment of fatigue reliability of OWT support structures in the presence of  
assumed SHM/CM data 
During the in -service life  of OWT support structures,  the state of specific parameters such as crack 
depth and  stress/strain  can be measured and monitored with SHM/CM . In the presence of  SHM/CM 
data,  a reassessment of the OWT support structure’s fatigue reliability  can be carried out based on the 
FM method.  
In the initial FRA, t he stress range  employed in the FM approach was  calculated via FEA modelling.  
The stress/ strain history at the critical location can be measured and monitored during the in-service 
life of OWTs  with SHM/CM systems, and these measured data can be applied  in updating the fatigue 
stress range. For example , assuming after six years of operation, the measured  fatigue stress range is 
10% or 20% higher than the original values calculated via FEA modelling. Then, the OWT support 
structure's fatigue reliability  can be reassessed  based on the  measured stress values  and the  FM method.  
Let case (a) denote the original ly calculated fatigue stress range case and (b) and (c) represent the  cases  
with 10% and 20% higher measured values than the original, respectively. For instance, Figure 20 
shows the original and updated reliability index over time. A s can be inferred , the updated reliability 
index curve  in the case ( b), was lower than the case (a). Thus, a negative correlation is observed as a 
higher value of stress range yields lower reliability.  
After  the fatigue reliability overtime is calculated, it is necessary to schedule the inspection activities. 
In order to estimate  the times for inspections, a threshold RI  for the IMR  need s to be identified.  The 
target / threshold  RI value is taken to be 3.71, according to [30,63]. As can be observed from the  same 
figure, the inspection based on the original reliability curve  (case (a)) , and updated reliability curve for 
cases (b) and (c)  are 9.2, 9.08, and 8.75 years, respectively.

Figure 21. Fatigue reliability assessment at different values of initial crack size  
The FM FRA method  is dependent on the assumed  initial crack depth.  The measured crack depth via  
SHM/CM  system during the in -service life  of OWTs  can be used  in updating  the calculated  RI based on 
the FM approach. Figure 21  depicts such an example wherein  the initial crack depth i s assumed to be  
0.11mm.  The crack depth assumed to be measured at Year 6 is 0.276mm or 0.51mm  [74]. Thus, t hree 
cases are considered  where the crack depth  assumes : (a) the original value  of 0.11, (b) an SHM/CM 
measured value of  0.276mm, and then (c) SHM/CM measured value of 0.51mm.    
A
lso presented in the figure is the reliability threshold with a value of 3.71. It can be inferred from this 
figure  that: (i) the updated reliability index curve  plotted  for cases (b) and (c) are both  lower than the 
case (a) , respectively; (ii) a larger crack depth yields lower reliability; (iii ) the inspection time calculated 
for cases (a), (b), and (c)  is 9.68, 8.34 and 8.10 years, respectively.  From the foregoing, it can be inferred  
that the reliability index 𝛽𝛽  is sensitive to the initial crack  size 𝑑𝑑𝑤𝑤. Hence,  the measured SHM/CM stress, 
as well as crack size, are valuable data for updating the fatigue RI using the FM approach, achieving an 
optimised  inspection plan and saving OPEX of OWT support structures [17]. 
5 Conclusion 
In this work, S- N curve  and FM approaches to fatigue reliability assessment were compared. A 3D 
parametric FEA model of OWT jacket support structures was developed, taking account of soil -
structure interactions.  In the FM approach, another FEA model of a curved plate was developed to 
simulate a part of the  welded joint representing the  failure –critical hot -spot location where the most 
cumulative fatigue damage occurs.  A number of stochastic FEA simulations of the OWT  were 
performed considering stochastic variables such as environmental and aerodynamic loads as well as 
soil properties. In the S- N curve  approach, an ANN RSM was developed such that the result obtained 
from the 3D FEA simulations are used to derive the performance function  expressed in terms of 
important stochastic variables. Whereas i n the FM approach, this was achieved by linking the two FEA 
models developed  via a second ANN developed for the surrogate modelling. Subsequently, the FORM 
is applied  for both methods  in calculating the fatigue reliability index of the structure. The results of the 
fatigue reliability assessment  whilst  comparing with the S-N curve  approach revealed that  the FM 
approach was optimistic at the beginning while it  was found to be more conservative towards the end 
of the through- life of the structure . It can be concluded that the  S-N approach should be used during the 
design stage, while the FM approach should be used as the structure approaches failure.  Sensitivity

 studies were performed to investigate the effect of COVs of the random parameters involved in the 
model on the structure's response.  The results revealed  a strong dependence of the reliability index on 
the COV of the material constants.  This signifies that apart from the ir magnitudes, the uncertainties of 
the crack growth law  constant s are critical factors  that can radically change the structure's reliability 
performanc e. Applying the S -N curve approach, the impact of  assumin g correlation between structural 
design parameters on the reliability performance of the OWT support structure was elucidated.  The 
reliability index  values calculated was found to decrease as the percentage correlation increases. 
Furthermore, other fatigue reliability assessment exercise performed include estimating the  threshold 
inspection time for the support structure determined via updating the developed reliability framework 
with assumed SHM/CM data.  Hence, the updated reliability assessment provides valuable information 
for making decisions  with respect to  the IMR  of OWT jacket support structures. Also, the fatigue 
reliability index calculated assuming a correlation between both segments of the crack growth law from 
the bilinear FM approach is sensitive to the initial crack depth, and a  larger  initial crack size lead s to 
lower reliability .
