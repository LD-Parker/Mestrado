Abstract: Offshore wind (OSW) energy is a renewable source with strong prospects of development
that may decisively contribute towards energy independence. Offshore wind is, however, not yet
ubiquitously cost competitive, and frequently requires support schemes to ﬁnance its extensive
capital requirements. Therefore, cost reduction strategies are necessary for the future development
of offshore wind technologies. Even if structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are currently
applied for the inspection of critical mechanical structures, they have not been the focus of research
from offshore wind stakeholders. The main goal of this study is to evaluate the viability of SHM
systems on the support structures of bottom-ﬁxed offshore wind (BFOSW), alongside the impact
of implementing these systems on life-cycle. Economic models are used to estimate the impact of
implementing these systems, explained using a case-study of the Kaskasi farm in the German North
Sea. General results indicate that installing SHM systems on the support structures of offshore wind
can shift the maintenance strategies from preventive to predictive, allowing the intervals between
inspections to be increased without a reduction on equipment availability. The greatest beneﬁt is
related with the possibility of extending the operational life of the farm.

1. Introduction
The energetic paradigm is changing towards a low-carbon society, and Europe has
been the leading force pushing this transition. The European Union (EU) has deﬁned a 20%
global quota for renewable energy sources by 2020 and 32% by 2030 [ 1,2]. Scenarios for
100% renewable use by 2050 have been evaluated [ 3] and the EU has called for countries
to become carbon neutral within that timeframe [ 4]. OSW is an excellent energy resource
due to stronger, more consistent, and less turbulent winds compared to the onshore re-
source. Furthermore, there are extensive areas offshore available for the installation of
wind farms. For Europe, estimations are pointing towards a potential capacity of 150 GW
by 2030 and 460 GW by 2050 [ 5,6]. Moreover, countries with large economies including
the United States of America (USA) and China have been investigating OSW as a tool for
reducing their carbon emissions [ 7,8]. In shallow waters, the monopile solution is the most
affordable, accounting for 81% of the turbines installed in Europe [ 9]. At greater depths, the
monopiles become impractical as the imposed technical challenges result in costs that ex-
ceeds the cost of other solutions, namely, ﬂoating structures and jacket foundations [ 10,11].
Currently, ﬂoating foundations cannot compete within the offshore wind energy market
due to their lower Technology Readiness Level (TRL) [ 5] with the capital expenditure

(CAPEX) for OSW implementation being historically higher than those of other renewable
technologies, [ 12–15]. Until recently, this has required the use of policy support schemes
which have granted ﬁxed prices to cover the cost of energy production for OSW farms
(OSWF). In fact, tariff support is often required to boost technologies that are not yet capable
of competing on a level playing ﬁeld, sector or market [16].
In the ﬁrst years of offshore wind implementation, the most common tariff support
scheme for OSW was based on ﬁxed compensations per unit of energy produced [ 17].
However, different sources have shown that ﬁxed-tariff schemes were not contributing to
the competitiveness on the sector, as costs rose considerably for the ﬁnal consumer. Lately,
a different scheme has been utilized, where bidding tenders are opened for certain offshore
areas (also called reverse auctions) [ 18]. The proposal that requires the lowest cost per unit
of energy usually wins the tender and the respective company or consortium becomes
responsible for overseeing the installation and operation of that speciﬁc farm. Recent
projects yet to be installed in the North Sea have been issued without requiring any tariff
support, or subsidy-free, acting as a milestone for these technologies [ 19]. Nonetheless,
this situation is still an exception: Cost reduction is the number one driver for the OSW
stakeholders so that these technologies may compete in the non-subsidized energy market.
From the perspective of the project manager, the life-cycle of an OSWF requires a long
process of surveying, licensing, production, acquisition, installation, operation, and, ﬁnally,
decommissioning. These life-cycle steps may be classiﬁed according to the expenses related
to each step, which are presented in Figure 1. The respective cost breakdown, by life-cycle
stage, is presented in Figure 2.
Development expenditures (DEVEX) are related to the processes produced prior to
the installation of the farm. They represent, typically, a small slice of the farm overall costs—
Figure 1. CAPEX are the costs associated with the materials required for the construction
and operation of the OSWF. They include the costs of equipment, such as electric cable
connections, turbines, and foundations, but also the cost of installation, the cost of capital,
and the cost of insurance. According to the sources used on Figure 2, CAPEX is responsible
for approximately three quarters of the levelized cost of energy (LCoE) of an OSWF.

In the ﬁrst years of oﬀshore wind implementation,  the most common  tariﬀ support 
scheme for OSW was based on ﬁxed compensations  per unit of energy produced  [17]. 
However,  diﬀerent sources have shown that ﬁxed-tariﬀ schemes were not contributing  to 
the competitiveness  on the sector, as costs rose considerably  for the ﬁnal consumer.  Lately, 
a diﬀerent scheme has been utilized, where bidding tenders are opened for certain 
oﬀshore areas (also called reverse auctions)  [18]. The proposal  that requires the lowest 
cost per unit of energy usually wins the tender and the respective  company  or consortium

costs—Figure  1. CAPEX are the costs associated  with the materials  required  for the

cost of capital, and the cost of insurance.  According  to the sources used on Figure 2, 
CAPEX is responsible  for approximately  three quarters of the levelized  cost of energy 
(LCoE) of an OSWF. 
Operational  Expenditures  (OPEX) relate to costs associated  with the operation,  
maintenance,  insurance,  port activities,  and licensing  fees for the OSWF [23], and account 
for about one ﬁfth of the LCOE of OSW. There are some opportunities  regarding  cost 
reduction  for OPEX, including  bigger turbines that will likely reduce OPEX as less 
turbines are installed  for the same farm capacity [21]. Other strategies  include developing  
inter-operator  maintenance  concepts  [24]; introducing  innovative  parts which require less 
maintenance,  such as direct-drive  trains [21]; better mitigation  of key risks due to 
accumulated  operational  experience  [21]; and introducing  complex condition  monitoring  
to improve the maintenance  of the frameworks  currently  used [21,25]. 
Finally, as the farm reaches the end of its useful lifetime, decommissioning  processes  
are required  to remove the turbine equipment  and the respective  foundations  and cables 
from the seabed. International  regulations  deﬁne that these components  must be fully 
removed,  such as regulations  stating that monopiles  must be cut several meters below the 
mudline [26]. Nonetheless,  these costs represent  only a fraction of the total expenditures  
of a certain farm—around  2% according  to Figure 2. This would be expected  as the LCoE 
is a ﬁnancially  discounted  measure  of the cost of energy. Therefore,  costs that are incurred  
at the end of the operation  of the farm are highly discounted  and have little impact on this 
LCoE calculation.  Moreover,  insurance  surety bonds that will cover the decommissioning  
of the farm in case the project managing  company  cannot fulﬁl them, are now mandatory  
[27]. 
Several institutions  have evaluated  cost reduction  potential  for OSW, such as The

others, including  academia,  through internationally  funded research projects. According

the policy makers, both relying on their related administration  actors, such as 
governments.  Strong coherent  policy frameworks  should, therefore,  be generated  to 
provide the necessary  stable regime to OSW utilities. On the technical  side, technological  
innovation  must be promoted,  while at the same time increasing  eﬃciency within several

Operational Expenditures (OPEX) relate to costs associated with the operation, main-
tenance, insurance, port activities, and licensing fees for the OSWF [ 23], and account for
about one ﬁfth of the LCOE of OSW. There are some opportunities regarding cost reduction
for OPEX, including bigger turbines that will likely reduce OPEX as less turbines are in-
stalled for the same farm capacity [ 21]. Other strategies include developing inter-operator
maintenance concepts [ 24]; introducing innovative parts which require less maintenance,
such as direct-drive trains [ 21]; better mitigation of key risks due to accumulated oper-
ational experience [ 21]; and introducing complex condition monitoring to improve the
maintenance of the frameworks currently used [21,25].
Finally, as the farm reaches the end of its useful lifetime, decommissioning processes
are required to remove the turbine equipment and the respective foundations and cables
from the seabed. International regulations deﬁne that these components must be fully
removed, such as regulations stating that monopiles must be cut several meters below the
mudline [ 26]. Nonetheless, these costs represent only a fraction of the total expenditures of
a certain farm—around 2% according to Figure 2. This would be expected as the LCoE is a
ﬁnancially discounted measure of the cost of energy. Therefore, costs that are incurred at the
end of the operation of the farm are highly discounted and have little impact on this LCoE
calculation. Moreover, insurance surety bonds that will cover the decommissioning of the
farm in case the project managing company cannot fulﬁl them, are now mandatory [27].
Several institutions have evaluated cost reduction potential for OSW, such as The
Crown Estate [ 21], Fichtner [ 24], TKI Wind op Zee [ 22], and DNV [ 28], amongst many
others, including academia, through internationally funded research projects. According
to their conclusions, cost reductions can be achieved by efforts taken by the industry and
the policy makers, both relying on their related administration actors, such as govern-
ments. Strong coherent policy frameworks should, therefore, be generated to provide the
necessary stable regime to OSW utilities. On the technical side, technological innovation
must be promoted, while at the same time increasing efﬁciency within several related
processes—such as energy transmission, logistic procedures, and maintenance methods.
One method to reduce costs of OSW is the implementation of structural health monitoring
systems within support structures, to guarantee continuous monitoring of the condition
and damage accumulation on these structures.
Structural Health Monitoring systems (SHMs) are instruments used in the inspection
of the structural integrity of mechanical structures, with the main goal of acknowledging
its health status, to guarantee safe operation and maximize equipment availability [ 29].
Compared to traditional methods of inspection, SHMs provides a more accurate and
comprehensive understanding of the structural behavior and its condition. Traditional
methods often rely on periodic inspections or visual assessments which may miss subtle
changes or hidden defects. Furthermore, as larger farms are installed farther from shore, in
deeper waters and in harsher metocean than the German portion of the North Sea (such as
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

the Atlantic), the beneﬁts of SHMs will become more evident [ 30]. Moreover, the SHMs
facilitate predictive maintenance practices. By collecting and analyzing data on a continual
basis, it becomes possible to identify early signs of deterioration and anomalies, allowing
for proactive maintenance actions. This approach not only minimizes downtime and
reduces repair costs but also extends the operational lifetime of offshore wind structures,
maximizing their economic viability. These systems usually rely on the acquisition and
processing of mechanical strains and vibrations, modal properties, thermal imaging, or
corrosion rates [31,32]. They provide useful information to farm owners about the overall
condition of the structure, allowing for more efﬁcient operation and maintenance (O&M)
planning and early acknowledgement of potential structural failures [ 33]. Ultimately, cost
savings may be achieved from their use, but other related beneﬁts, such as human life and
reputation savings, can also be obtained. These monitoring systems are usually coupled to
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), which have been extensively used
by the wind industry. These are speciﬁcally applied to failure-prone turbine components
including the blades [ 31,34], generator, and drivetrain [ 35]. However, OSW turbine towers
and their foundations have not been the extensive focus of these systems. Still, some
developments have been made, which are indicated below.
Fischer and Coronado [ 36] from the Fraunhofer Institute for Wind Energy and Energy
System Technology stated that SHMs for structural integrity of onshore and offshore wind
structures are becoming more and more considered by the wind industry; in fact, they
allow for a condition-based predictive maintenance. This is possible since SHMs can detect
signs or indications that a functional failure may happen soon [ 36]. The BSH Agency
(German Maritime and Hydrographic Agency) has already deﬁned for German OSWFs
mandatory SHMs on the foundations, in a cadence of 1 in every 10 turbines as deﬁned on
its standard [ 37]. A Standard produced by DNV-GL recommends the monitoring of the
tower and foundation, although this is not yet mandatory [ 38]. Dai K. et al. have dedicated
their research to the health monitoring of wind turbines, concluding that is fundamental to
efﬁciently build bigger turbines [ 39]. The Block Island OSWF, the ﬁrst in the USA, has a
dedicated SHMs on the support structures speciﬁcally designed for structural performance
assessment and fatigue life prediction [40].
Nonetheless, the OSW industry is not fully aware of the opportunities that arise with
the implementation of SHMs on the support structures of OSW. In fact, the advantages of
using these systems are not limited to operational procedures. Capital costs may decrease
if the perceived risk of the project is lower, which may impact the insurance costs and
the project’s interest rates. Moreover, SHMs allow the determination of the remaining
useful life of these structures, which is particularly relevant once the farm reaches its
operational lifetime limit. If there is an opportunity to extend the lifetime of a certain farm,
then thorough data regarding the condition of these structures is necessary to testify the
feasibility of this life extension. Moreover, SHMs can provide useful data for designers to
iterate future foundation designs: improved engineering designs are expected to result into
economic savings.
This research introduces several innovative contributions that advance the current
understanding of implementing SHMs on the support structures of bottom-ﬁxed offshore
wind. The key innovations and contributions of this research include:
 Development of a techno-economic analysis framework: This paper presents a com-
prehensive techno-economic analysis framework for evaluating the viability of SHMs
on the support structure of bottom-ﬁxed offshore wind farms. The framework takes
into account various factors such as capital expenditures, operational risk reduction,
maintenance optimization, life extension potential, and an overall economic feasibility;
 Incorporation of Monte Carlo simulations: The study employs Monte Carlo simulation
methods to model and evaluate the performance of SHMs in offshore wind operations.
The simulated random failure events and failure detection efﬁciencies provide a
quantitative assessment of the impact of SHMs on the overall energy production and
lifetime of wind farms;

 Integration of ﬁnancial considerations: In addition to technical aspects, this research
integrates ﬁnancial considerations by assessing the cost-beneﬁt analysis of implement-
ing SHMs. By quantifying the trade-off between initial capital costs and long-term
operational beneﬁts, the study offers insights into the economic viability and potential
revenue gains associated with SHM implementation.
These contributions collectively contribute to the existing body of knowledge by
providing a comprehensive evaluation of the beneﬁts and feasibility of SHMs in offshore
wind energy. The ﬁndings of this research have signiﬁcant implications for the design,
operation, and maintenance strategies of offshore wind farms, ultimately fostering the
growth and sustainability of this renewable energy sector.
This paper is structured into four main sections; Introduction; Methods; Results;
and Discussion and Conclusions. The Introduction section provides an overview of the
research topic and highlights the signiﬁcance of implementing SHMs in bottom-ﬁxed
offshore wind energy. It presents the key objectives addressed in the study, as well as the
innovations and contributions of the research. The Methods section outlines the approach
and methodology employed, including the techno-economic analysis framework and the
utilization of Monte Carlo simulation methods. The Results section presents the ﬁndings
of the analysis, including the impacts of SHMs on capital expenditure, operational risk
reduction, maintenance optimization, and overall economic feasibility for the case-study of
the Kaskasi OSWF. Finally, the Discussion and Conclusions section interprets the results,
discusses their implications, and highlights the contributions of the study to the existing
body of knowledge. It also offers insights into the future directions of research and practical
implications for the implementation of SHMs in offshore wind projects.
2. Methods
SHMs may impact different stages of the life-cycle and the respective operational
cash-ﬂow of a certain OSWF. Firstly, the implementation of SHMs increases the capital
expenditures, due to acquisition and installation. Here, the CAPEX of a new farm is
estimated using a model developed within this research. Indicative values for the cost of
SHMs are provided, according to complexity of the considered system (more complexity
can detect more failure modes, but with an additional cost). Then, a simulation model of
failure events and their detection prior to the function loss is used to evaluate the impact
of including these systems during operation. The detection efﬁciency of the SHMs is
compared with the interval between physical inspections employed on a certain farm,
amongst several other operational parameters. Moreover, a discussion on the inﬂuence of
SHMs on the operational insurance costs is provided. In the end, a cash-ﬂow model is used
to discuss the viability of SHMs on OSW towers and foundations. Life-extension of the
farm evaluated on the case-study is considered, and the respective economic beneﬁts from
this extension are discussed.
2.1. Capital Expenditures of Offshore Wind
Capital expenditures for OSW are currently declining, but this was not always the case
in the past, where OSW CAPEX rose unexpectedly up to values higher than EUR 4 million
per MW of new capacity back in 2016 [ 15]. Furthermore, impacts of the pandemic and the
Ukrainian war still need to be considered in future models. In this research, the OSWF
database [ 15] and an estimation model for future OSW CAPEX [ 41] are used. The number
of farms and installed capacity per country considered on the said database is presented
in Figure 3.
The CAPEX estimating model is based on multiple linear regressions built from the
mentioned database, using as the explanatory variables three technical parameters of
farms (Turbine Capacity, Average Depth, and Distance to Shore) together with two dummy
variables (Rest of Europe, and Tripod and Jacket) that reﬂect the effect of different countries
with different support policies and the effect of different foundations. The ﬁrst takes the

value 0 if the farm is installed in the UK, and 1 if elsewhere in Europe. The second takes
the value 1 if a tripod or jacket foundation is used, and 0 if not (Table 1).

Capital expenditures  for OSW are currently  declining,  but this was not always the

OSWF database  [15] and an estimation  model for future OSW CAPEX [41] are used. The 
number of farms and installed  capacity per country considered  on the said database  is 
presented  in Figure 3. 
The CAPEX estimating  model is based on multiple  linear regressions  built from the 
mentioned  database,  using as the explanatory  variables  three technical  parameters  of 
farms (Turbine  Capacity,  Average Depth, and Distance  to Shore) together with two 
dummy variables  (Rest of Europe, and Tripod and Jacket) that reﬂect the eﬀect of diﬀerent 
countries  with diﬀerent support policies and the eﬀect of diﬀerent foundations.  The ﬁrst 
takes the value 0 if the farm is installed  in the UK, and 1 if elsewhere  in Europe. The second 
takes the value 1 if a tripod or jacket foundation  is used, and 0 if not (Table 1).

Then, the non-technical inﬂuences affecting the CAPEX per MW of OSW, which can be
caused by demand peaks, variations on price indexes, and changes within policy schemes,
amongst other socioeconomic factors, are considered using an exponential trendline that
connects the CAPEX/MW peak of OSW in 2016 (at 4.23 million EUR/MW) [ 15] to the
value expected for OSW by WindEurope by 2030, at 2 million EUR/MW [ 42]—as shown
in Figure 4. It is important to highlight that these three trends shown in Figure 4 reﬂect

Cost of Implementing Structural Health Monitoring Systems
To estimate the impact of SHMs on the capital expenditures, the intrinsic cost of
acquiring and installing these systems needs to be estimated. Firstly, the failure modes
associated with the support structures of OSW must be assessed and categorized. These
failure modes were detailed based on the results from structural computational models
and from operational failures occurring at real OSWFs for the monopile foundation [ 41].
When monitoring systems are not implemented, in-site inspections are used to evaluate
evidence on the initiation or propagation of these failure modes. With SHMs, different
dedicated systems can be deployed to detect them instead. During this research, several
companies specialized in the manufacturing and installation of SHMs were approached.
These contacts provided technical information regarding the market existing systems, as
well as the associated qualitative costs for their implementation. These companies included
DNV-GL (Høvik, Norway), FiberSensing—HBM (Porto, Portugal), Nortek (Providence,
RI, USA), SamCon (Lohra-Altenvers, Germany), SPECMAN (Portuguese Brüel & Kjær
representative) (Lisbon, Portugal), StrainLab (Stockholm, Sweden), SmartBolts (Frederick,
MD, USA) and Zensor (Etterbeek, Belgium). Only the monopile foundation is analyzed
in this research, as it accounts for 81% of the foundations used in Europe [ 9]. Other
foundations will have different failure modes, which need to be independently evaluated.
Table 2 presents the failure modes considered for the monopile foundation support
structures, and the respective estimated cost for a SHMs implemented to detect each mode.
For the cash-ﬂow model, this value is added to the CAPEX estimated from the model of
Section 2.1, if a SHMs is implemented at the support structures of the tested farm. The
proposed monitoring systems are technically detailed below:

Figure 6 presents the generic locations for the installation of the sensors dedicated
to monitor scouring, the grout connection, and the dynamics of the tower. On the top of
the tower, usually inside the nacelle and near the connection between the nacelle and the
tower, an acceleration sensor is installed that allows the characterization of the dynamic
behavior of the tower, such as its vibration shapes and modal frequencies. Below, next to
the sea line, monitoring of the grout condition can be conducted using strain gauges which
are installed at the top of the cementitious material, allowing measurement of the stress
level subjected into it. Displacement probes may be included in the SHMs that measure the
relative displacement between the TP and the monopile. This is a clear indicator of failure
of the grout material, in the case relevant displacements are registered. In total, four strain
gauges are considered here, as well as four displacement probes. Finally, three scouring
monitors based on acoustic emissions are considered on the bottom of the transition piece,
with the goal of measuring in real time the scouring depths around the monopile. These
monitors have already been tested in conditions and are currently being used for several
situations where scouring may represent an issue to structural integrity.

Cracks and structural failures such as those caused by buckling may be detected
using strain and acceleration measurements. Furthermore, strain measurements allow the
characterization of the loadings subjected to the structures throughout time. Acceleration
and strain data patterns may change when the rigidity of the structure is modiﬁed due to
damage, which can be used to identify potential failures on the structure [ 43–45]. Here,
the installation of strain gauges at a minimum of three different levels is proposed, with a
cadency of 4 rosette-type strain gauges per level. Still, more levels could be added to raise
the detail of loads measured. Rosette-type strain gauges are better suited than uniaxial
strain gauges as these allow the determination of principal stresses and respective directions
and of equivalent stresses [ 46]. As such, these can identify shear stresses applied to the
tower, contrary to uniaxial gauges which are vertically aligned.
Both bolted connections: one between the nacelle and the tower; and the other one
between the tower and the TP , are monitored using state-of-art monitoring bolts that
provide information on the preload throughout the lifetime of the turbine. These solutions
are currently commercially available from the companies Strain-Labs and Transmission
Dynamics [ 47,48]; the general idea behind these systems is to monitor a certain number
of bolts from a speciﬁc bolted connection. In this research, it is considered that half the
bolts of a certain connection may be monitored, according to the experience provided
by Strain-labs [ 47]. Furthermore, these bolted connections can be monitored from the
analysis of acceleration patterns [ 49,50]. Thus, four accelerometers are installed per bolted
connection. It is important to mention that in this document, it is assumed that the tower is
a unique component. This is not always the case; many times, turbine towers are divided
into different segments which are connected between each other using ﬂanged bolted
connections. These additional connections should also be monitored according to the
described setup.
Finally, the monitoring of the transition piece is also proposed, including four rosette-
type strain gauges at a predeﬁned level. Moreover, an accelerometer may be included here
to evaluate the vibrational level at the transition piece.
Figure 8 presents the generic locations for the installation of the sensors dedicated
to monitoring corrosion rates on the turbine tower and transition piece. This can be
measured using corrosion rate data loggers, using electrical resistance sensors to evaluate
the corrosion speeds registered between two different points of the structure. These
corrosion rate measurers are commercially available from some suppliers with offshore
expertise, such as Zensor and Cosasco. For the suggested setup, two of these systems
are installed, one for each support structure (transition piece and tower). Then, visual

2.2. Operational Expenditures
Structural Health Monitoring systems may decisively impact the costs associated
with operation and maintenance, since they open the possibility of using more advanced
maintenance strategies [ 51]. Failures occurring at the support structures of OSW may result
in the catastrophic failure of the turbine, with obvious negative economic and reputational
impacts. By continuously monitoring the structure, its condition can be acknowledged
in real-time and its accumulated damage can be computed and potential failures can be
detected early on, especially with the use of machine learning algorithms that process
extensive operational data [ 52,53]. On the other hand, SHMs may also positively impact
other processes; as it decreases the risk of a certain project, it can reduce expenses associated
with operational insurance and; as it can be used as tool to estimate the accumulated
damage on the support structures, it can help during life extension decisions.
2.2.1. Insurance Costs
There are few data available on the literature regarding the operational insurance
costs of OSW. Therefore, six specialists from the insurance sector working with OSW were
contacted and interviewed under small, structured interview conditions. These specialists
highlighted how difﬁcult it is to estimate the costs of operational risk insurance prices
down to one number, due to the intricate inﬂuence of a multitude of factors. Furthermore,
these costs appear to be decreasing year after year, as the technological maturity increases.
Still, a range of costs were obtained, from 0.01 to 0.015 million EUR per MW of installed
capacity per year of operation. Moreover, whilst some specialists admitted that any system
which may help reduce the number of losses or minimize the impact of those losses will
have a direct impact on the insurance cost, others stated that SHMs will have a limited
effect on insurance costs since insurance providers are more worried about catastrophic
events, such as storms and collisions. Nonetheless, SHMs were viewed by the experts as an
advantage at the long run, especially because they allow for more effective maintenance
strategies, but with little short-term impact. A decrease on the insurance costs caused by
the implementation of SHMs was deemed very unlikely by some of the interviewees, while
others admitted that such systems could reduce insurance costs at about a few percent.
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

Overall, the common opinion was that these systems can provide bigger advantages to farm
owners on other processes rather than in insurance, and their use is highly recommended.
2.2.2. Simulation Model
Monte Carlo simulation methods involve the generation of random numbers to study
interesting phenomena by considering the probability of speciﬁc events [ 54]. In this study,
a Monte Carlo-based model is employed to assess the value of SHMs during the operation
of offshore wind farms. The objective of this model is to estimate the total energy produc-
tion of a wind farm over its lifetime. Failures in the support structures are assumed to
occur randomly, with an annual failure rate of 0.18, consistent with the value estimated by
James Carroll et al. [ 55]. The detection of failures depends on the monitoring efﬁciency of
SHMs (SHME), whereby failures may or may not be detected randomly. In the absence
of monitoring, failures may be detected during periodic on-site inspections conducted
at a speciﬁc interval (interval between inspections—IbI). Regardless, the wind farm un-
dergoes inspections at a designated IbI. Further details on this model can be found in
Vieira M. et al. [56].
In Figure 9, the sequence of events for a turbine without Structural Health Monitoring
(SHMs) is illustrated. During operation, a potentially critical failure arises under Mode
6. Despite the absence of SHMs, a subsequent inspection successfully resolves the issue.
However, another potentially critical failure emerges under Mode 9. In the subsequent
time step, the turbine experiences an irreversible failure.

arises under Mode 6, which is promptly  detected by the SHMs. Consequently,  the turbine 
is promptly  shut down, and maintenance  operations  are conducted  to address the 
situation.  Subsequently,  another potentially  critical failure emerges under Mode 9, which 
goes undetected  by the SHMs. Nonetheless,  the issue is successfully  resolved  during the

Figure 11 illustrates the average outcomes derived from ten model runs for a represen-
tative wind farm comprising one hundred 5-MW turbines, with a typical capacity factor
of 40%, operating for 25 years. These results demonstrate the ﬂuctuation in the overall
energy production of the wind farm based on the interval between inspections (IbI) and the
detection efﬁciency of the SHMs (SHME). They indicate that a higher SHME and a lower
IbI contribute to increased energy production for the farm. Additionally, the ﬁndings reveal
that implementing SHMs with a signiﬁcant SHME (above 0.6) enables the extension of IbI
without diminishing the overall energy production.

Results from Figure 11 do not consider electricity prices, nor the costs of inspecting and
maintaining the farm. Inspecting a farm is an expensive operation that is also dependent
on weather conditions. Figure 9 presents the earnings obtained from the same generic farm
installed in 2020, considering the electricity prices estimated by BrainPool up to the year
2050 [57], and the inspection and maintenance costs estimated by Iain Dinwoodie [58].
Results from Figure 12 are considerably different from those of Figure 11, now that
revenues, inspection, and maintenance costs are included. As shown, an IbI of 2 months
strongly affects the farm earnings, mainly due to the costs associated with inspection. In
fact, an SHME above 0.6 allows the use of longer IbIs, with higher earnings than those with
no SHMs implemented for any IbI.

discounted cash ﬂow model which analyzes the life-cycle stages that have are susceptible
to the implementation of SHMs—construction, operation, and potential life extension—is
presented. These stages are those where SHMs could more relevantly impact the OSW
global costs.
Figure 13 presents the general framework of the developed model. Initially, the
construction of the farm takes place and for that the farm owner must guarantee the
necessary liquidity to fulﬁl payments to suppliers of equipment and providers of relevant
services, such as farm installation. This CAPEX is estimated using the model presented
in Section 2.1. Then, throughout operation, which is assumed to start two years after the
beginning of the farm’s construction, the operational revenue, expenditures, and insurance
costs are considered, as well as debt payments and equity compensations.

Section 2.1. Then, throughout  operation,  which is assumed  to start two years after the

Figure 13. Framework  of the cash- ﬂow model developed,  which considers  three main life-cycle  
stages: construction,  operation,  and life extension.  
Finally, the model assumes that monitored  farms may have their lifetime extended  
for 5 years after the initially expected  lifetime is reached. In fact, according  to the 
respective  standard  from DNV-GL  [61], extending  the lifetime of a turbine requires the 
provision  of documentation  proving that the turbine still possesses  the necessary  
structural  integrity  to endure additional  operational  years. SHMs should provide 
information  on the accumulated  damage throughout  the expected  operational  years, plus 
be able to continuously  monitor the structures  during the additional  extended  period. 
Without them, life extension  can result in additional  uncertainties  and risks, which will 
result in increased  insurance  and operational  costs. Moreover,  it is not clear that the 
certifying  bodies would approve life extension  periods on farms that do not provide 
strong evidence  that the support structures  will structurally  sustain these additional  
years. 
Discounted  cash ﬂows consider  that money on hand today has a higher intrinsic 
value than money to be received in the future [60]. Grant Thornton,  an independent  
accounting  and consulting  organization,  has evaluated  discount  rates for OSW projects in 
diﬀerent countries  [62]. For the two OSW European  leaders, it estimated  levered discount  
rates of 8.25% for Germany  and 8.75% for the UK. The industry  is maturing  through 
learning and scaling eﬀects; therefore,  a lower value of 6% will be considered  for the 
discount  rate on this research.  
The non-discounted  cashﬂow of a certain project for a certain expected  operational  
life (OY) can be described  through the following  Equation:

where Debt is the total debt contracted  at the beginning  of the project, Eq is the total equity 
used at the beginning  of the project, and CAPEX is the total capital expenditures  required  
to guarantee  the commissioning  of the farm. These three quantities  are related with the

Figure 13. Framework of the cash-ﬂow model developed, which considers three main life-cycle
stages: construction, operation, and life extension.
Finally, the model assumes that monitored farms may have their lifetime extended for
5 years after the initially expected lifetime is reached. In fact, according to the respective
standard from DNV-GL [ 61], extending the lifetime of a turbine requires the provision of
documentation proving that the turbine still possesses the necessary structural integrity to
endure additional operational years. SHMs should provide information on the accumulated
damage throughout the expected operational years, plus be able to continuously monitor
the structures during the additional extended period. Without them, life extension can
result in additional uncertainties and risks, which will result in increased insurance and
operational costs. Moreover, it is not clear that the certifying bodies would approve life
extension periods on farms that do not provide strong evidence that the support structures
will structurally sustain these additional years.
Discounted cash ﬂows consider that money on hand today has a higher intrinsic value
than money to be received in the future [60]. Grant Thornton, an independent accounting
and consulting organization, has evaluated discount rates for OSW projects in different
countries [ 62]. For the two OSW European leaders, it estimated levered discount rates of
8.25% for Germany and 8.75% for the UK. The industry is maturing through learning and
scaling effects; therefore, a lower value of 6% will be considered for the discount rate on
this research.
The non-discounted cashﬂow of a certain project for a certain expected operational
life (OY) can be described through the following Equation:
nDCF n=Debt +Eq CAPEX +n=OY
å
n= CY(Rev n Insn DebtPay n EquitPay n OPEX n) (4)
where Debt is the total debt contracted at the beginning of the project, Eqis the total equity
used at the beginning of the project, and CAPEX is the total capital expenditures required
to guarantee the commissioning of the farm. These three quantities are related with the
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2023 ,16, 4885 14 of 20
start of the installation, which happens CYyears prior to commissioning. Revis the revenue
obtained for each n-period, Insis related to the operational insurance expenses taken at
period n,DebtPay is the debt payment produced at the speciﬁc n-period, and OPEX are the
operational expenses undertaken at period n. Likewise, EquitPay are associated with the
compensations provided to the shareholders.
If the time value of money is considered in this analysis, then the discounted cash ﬂow
of the project follows:
DCF n=Debt +Eq CAPEX +n=OY
å
n= CYRev n Insn DebtPay n EquitPay n OPEX n
(1+r)n (5)
where ris the discount rate assumed for the project.
The model presented here estimates both non-discounted and discounted cash ﬂows
of a certain OSWF by calculating, year by year, the respective ﬂows of money. The model
assumes that debt payments start in the same year debt was contracted, and the duration
of the loan is one of the model’s variables. Compensations to the project’s stakeholders are
assumed throughout the expected operational period of the farm. These will have to be
retrieved from the operational margin and decided by the company’s management. The
main input variables considered by the model are presented in Table 3:

Two different situations are analyzed in this research:
 OSWF monitored at its support structures;
 OSWF not monitored at its support structures.
Debt and Equity are considered to cover for the CAPEX of the farm. CAPEX is
estimated according to the model presented in Section 2.1. Operational insurance costs are
estimated according to the conclusions presented on Section 2.2.1, and the Farm Revenue
and OPEX are estimated according to the Monte Carlo model outlined on Section 2.2.2 [ 56].
The model considers that the expected operational life of any farm is set at 25 years.
The extension of the operational life of the farm is only considered for the cases where
SHMs were installed at the support structures for an additional operation of 5 years.
3. Results
The results of this research are presented as a case-study that intends to estimate the
impact of installing SHMs on the support structures of one installed OSWF. The selected
farm was the Deutsche Kaskasi in Germany. All Euro currency values are updated to 2017,
according to the Producer Price Index by OECD.
Kaskasi Offshore Wind Farm
Kaskasi was installed at the North Sea and was consented back in 2013. It was
installed in 2021 and commissioning was completed in 2022. The main ﬁgures of this farm
are presented in Table 4.

years are assumed  and the farm possesses  SHMs, the non-discounted  savings with insur-
ance costs may reach more than 1 million Euros, if a decrease  of 1% in these costs is as-
sumed. A decrease  of around 6% on the operational  insurance  costs would be necessary

The non-discounted  cash ﬂow considerably  grows when the operational  life of the 
farm is extended.  Still, small rises are registered  when SHMs are included,  and no life

inspections  also result in lower OPEX. For example,  when comparing  the non-discounted

Kaskasi OSWF.
The non-discounted cash ﬂow considerably grows when the operational life of the
farm is extended. Still, small rises are registered when SHMs are included, and no life
extension is considered. Moreover, when SHMs are included, greater intervals between
inspections also result in lower OPEX. For example, when comparing the non-discounted
cash ﬂow of Tests 3 and 5, a difference of around EUR 41 million is registered. This is a
consequence of the costs associated with inspecting OSW, as discussed in Section 2.2. This
beneﬁt is not registered when the SHMs are not included (when comparing Tests 1 and
2), because the rise in the interval between inspections results in higher turbine losses,
decisively affecting the energy output of the farm. The EUR 41 million already largely
compensate for the installation of the SHMs on the support structures of OSW.
Finally, Table 8 presents the LCoE for the six evaluated Tests, plus the respective
non-discounted costs of energy.

The advantages of using the SHMs are not immediately perceived from the analysis
of the LCOE values. For example, the LCOE of Test 1 (no SHMs, IbI of 4 months) is only
slightly higher than the one of Test 5 (SHMs installed and IbI of 8 months). However, if the
non-discounted cost of energy is analyzed, then the economic beneﬁts of implementing
SHMs are more palpable. The same pattern is found for the rest of the Tests, with the costs
of energy being lower than the levelized ones.
These results may be surprising but can be explained due to two issues: First of
all, the LCOE is blinded to growing revenues over time, which are a consequence of the
expected rise in electricity prices in Europe in the next years. In fact, the LCOE equation
only considers the undertaken expenses and the overall energy produced by the farm.
Furthermore, the LCOE is based on economic rules that overvalue soon-to-be revenues
(which are proportional to the produced energy), and undervalue revenues/energy output
which are to be obtained during an extended time span. In fact, SHMs may provide
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

advantages, but these will most certainly be better perceived as the expected operational
lifetime of a certain farm is reached. In the beginning of operation, the advantages of their
implementation may not be immediately perceived.
Although these results do not intend to evaluate the attractiveness of the Kaskasi
project, since the model makes a series of assumptions due to lack of operational data,
some conclusions may be drawn from them. Life extension of the OSWF is decisively
impacting both the discounted and non-discounted cash ﬂows of the farm. The difference
in the non-discounted cash ﬂow between Tests 5 and 6 is greater than EUR 300 million (an
increase of almost 100%). When these values are discounted, the differences are shrunk
because the revenues from the extended operational period are highly discounted. Still,
Test 6 is the only tested scenario which registered a positive discounted cash ﬂow.
These results seem to indicate that:
 The impact of using SHMs on operational insurance costs can only cover for a small
slice of the costs associated with the implementation of SHMs, around EUR 1 million
(assuming a reduction of 1% on the insurance cost);
 Using SHMs allows the use of longer intervals between inspections, which may already
bring relevant economic beneﬁts, around EUR 41 million alone (an increase of almost
13% in the non-discounted cash ﬂow;
 The opportunity of extending the operation of the farm for 5 years, which may only
be possible with SHMs, will provide the biggest economic advantages to the farm
owners. Doing so could add more than EUR 300 million of added revenue estimated
on that operational extended period alone (an increase of almost 100%).
4. Discussion and Conclusions
This study has presented the development of a multidisciplinary and holistic research
which was produced to understand the viability of structural health monitoring systems
on the support structures of bottom-ﬁxed offshore wind.
The costs associated with the implementation of SHMs on OSW support structures
are relatively small when compared to the overall CAPEX of a certain farm, but are still
relevant and were, therefore, discussed and estimated. Contacts with insurance experts
were conducted, with diverging opinions on the topic. The present research assumes that
marginal beneﬁts can be obtained on the operational insurance costs by implementing
SHMs, but these are probably not sufﬁcient to totally compensate for their implementation.
The impact on maintenance expenditures may be relevant, as the intrinsic maintenance
strategy can be shifted from a preventive into a predictive one. The produced Monte Carlo
model provided results indicating that SHMs with good detection efﬁciencies can raise the
necessary interval between inspections (IbI), whilst guaranteeing the same farm energy
output. Moreover, when potential revenues and maintenance journey costs are included,
the beneﬁts of installing SHMs and increasing IbIs grew considerably. Furthermore, as
operational extension life of existing farms can only be consented after the validation of
several licensing and certifying bodies, and the respective equipment manufacturers, the
data gathered by these systems can be used to provide the detailed condition and remaining
useful life to these entities.
Whilst the implementation of SHMs has proved to bring relevant advantages by
changing the maintenance strategy and by allowing the use of bigger intervals between
inspections, the biggest economic beneﬁt from implementing SHMs seems to come from
generating the opportunity to extend the operational life of a certain OSWF. For the tested
case-study, this opportunity resulted in additional non-discounted cash inﬂows of more
than EUR 300 million for the Kaskasi OSWF. This value is not marginal and leaves no room
for doubt: life extension should only be considered if enough turbines are still operating
and if the SHMs installed on the support structures indicate that there are still relevant
remaining useful lives to guarantee adequate operation for further years.
The ﬁndings of this study signiﬁcantly contribute to and expand upon the existing
literature in the ﬁeld of offshore wind energy. Through the comprehensive techno-economic
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

analysis produced, this paper proved the feasibility of implementing SHMs on the sup-
port structure of bottom-ﬁxed offshore wind farms. In comparison to previous research,
the main conclusions highlight the impact of SHMs on capital expenditure (CAPEX) by
considering the cost of the system. However, the beneﬁts derived from SHMs, including
mitigating operational risk and optimizing maintenance operations, prove to outweigh the
initial capital costs. Furthermore, this study goes beyond existing literature by emphasizing
the potential for SHMs to provide valuable insight into acknowledging damage accumu-
lation on the structures to support life extension decisions. By extending the operational
lifetime of the wind farm, the true beneﬁts of implementing SHMs emerge, leading to the
generation of hundreds of millions in added revenue. Thus, this research ﬁlls a gap in
the current understanding of the ﬁeld by offering new perspectives and practical impli-
cations for future studies and the implementation of offshore wind projects. SHMs may
also have impacts that are not immediately quantiﬁable, such as allowing for the iteration
and improvement of current support structure’s mechanical design. Moreover, offshore
wind farms will continue to become bigger in capacity and farther from shore than the
existing ones, and eventually unconstrained by the water depth with ﬂoating foundations.
Eventually, regularly inspecting each turbine individually using technicians may become
an impractical task, not humanely achievable nor economically viable. In the end, as the
society converges into the concept of the Industry 4.0, the fourth industrial revolution, the
OSW-related industries will need to keep up with the current industrial trends. It does not
seem adequate to possess turbines more than 50 km off the coast, and not be able to acknowl-
edge in real time the condition of the support structures that hold the turbine equipment
in place.
