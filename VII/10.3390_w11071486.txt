Abstract: Oshore wind farms have a superior wind source to terrestrial wind farms, but they also
face more severe environmental conditions such as severe storms, typhoons, and sea waves. Scour
leads to the excavation of sediments around the foundations of structures, reducing the safe capacity
of the structures. The phenomenon of pier scour is extremely complex because of the combined e ects
of the vortex system involving time-dependent Ô¨Çow patterns and sediment transport mechanisms.
A real-time scour monitoring system can improve the safety of structures and a ord cost-e ective
operations by preventing premature or unnecessary maintenance. This paper proposes an on-site
scour monitoring system using visible light communication (VLC) modules for o shore wind turbine
installations. A Ô¨Çume experiment revealed that the system was highly sensitive and accurate in
monitoring seabed scour processes. This arrayed-VLC sensory system, proposed in this paper, has
considerable potential for safety monitoring and also can contribute to improving the accuracy of
empirical scour formulas for sustainable maintenance in the life cycle of o shore structures.

1. Introduction
Wind energy, in particular, o shore wind power, has been recognized as one of the highest
growing and the most important future renewable energy source [ 1,2]. Due to severe environmental
conditions‚Äîsuch as severe storms, typhoons, ocean currents, and waves‚Äîo shore wind farms face
more challenges in the issues of structure safety. Scour around the foundation of structure leads to the
excavation of sediment deposits, reducing the safe capacity of the structure [3,4].
The scour mechanism of o shore wind turbine foundation caused by waves and currents is quite
similar to bridge scour. From the studies of the past 30 years, Ô¨Çooding and foundation scouring
was the primary cause of 600 bridges failed or collapse in the United States [ 5‚Äì14]. Average damage
repair on highways cost of Ô¨Çooding in the United States is estimated to be $50 million per year [ 11].
A scour monitoring and early warning system must be developed for evaluating the safety of
structures. Moreover, conducting timely reinforcement and maintenance processes in response to
seabed topographical changes induced by current erosion and scour processes around these structures

is also needed. Information obtained from scour monitoring systems can help engineers to design
relatively safe and cost-e ective o shore wind farms.
The phenomenon of pier scour is extremely complex because of the combined e ects of the
vortex system involving time-dependent Ô¨Çow patterns and sediment transport mechanisms. Scour
processes around structures have received considerable attention over the past decades. Numerous
studies have explored the mechanisms of hydraulic scour around foundations and have presented
several formulas for scour depth estimation around piers. Most studies on scour have applied
experimental Ô¨Çumes and mainly focused on the application of empirical regression equations for
estimating the maximum scour depth. However, Ô¨Åeld data are limited because of the di culties
associated with long-term measurement processes. Without su cient Ô¨Åeld measurement data, such
empirical equations may not be su ciently accurate for Ô¨Åeld applications. In general, when a steady
current encounters a cylindrical vertical foundation, the Ô¨Çow rate increases around the periphery of
the foundation, producing a complex hydraulic Ô¨Çow such as a bow wave, a downÔ¨Çow in front of the
pier, a horseshoe vortex, and a highly turbulent wake in the downstream region of the foundation.
These combined e ects of hydraulic scour lead to the erosion of sediments from the foundation in
all directions and reduce the loading capacity of the foundation, thereby compromising the safety of
the supported structure [ 5‚Äì17]. Uncertainties regarding the maximum scour depth around o shore
wind turbines lead to complications in their design and risks in their operation. Several methods have
been proposed for estimating or monitoring the maximum scour depth around structures. A real-time
scour monitoring system can improve the safety of structures and a ord cost-e ective operations by
preventing premature or unnecessary maintenance [17].
In general, the di culty associated with developing measuring instruments with data acquisition
systems is ensuring their durability in monitoring large-scale hydraulic and transportation structures
under severe conditions. The Keulegan‚ÄìCarpenter number (KC) was applied to realize the foundation
uncertainties of marine wind farm structures scour [ 18]. There were many works focused on the
vibration-based approaches to monitoring the structural health status of the wind turbine [ 19‚Äì21]. For
example, a distributed-spring foundation model to estimate the variation of natural frequencies and
provide a strategy for addressing scour-induced damage around monopile foundations has used [ 22].
Full-scale o shore wind turbines with tripod structure were analyzed using real structural features
and three-dimensional (3D) Ô¨Ånite element models; the results show that scouring has a slight e ect on
natural frequency data [ 23]. Another study employed nonlinear springs to simulate the interaction
between the foundation of a wind turbine and soil subjected to di erent wind, wave, and current
loads‚ÄîreÔ¨Çecting operational conditions‚Äîto determine the e ects of scour on sti ness properties.
The results revealed that scour considerably altered the eigen frequency of the structure compared
with that of an o shore monopile wind turbine with scour protection [ 24,25]. Furthermore, a study
applied 3D computational Ô¨Çuid dynamics (CFD) to develop a numerical model to examine the seabed
boundary-layer Ô¨Çow around monopile and hexagonal gravity-based foundations of o shore wind
turbines; the Ô¨Çow was examined to determine the formation of horseshoe vortices and Ô¨Çow structures
to estimate potential scour for engineering designs. The results showed that the horseshoe vortex size
for the hexagonal gravity-based foundation was smaller than that for the monopile foundation [ 26‚Äì30].
Another study also proposed a wireless network monitoring system connected to an array of small
capacitive sensor probes installed around a foundation for observing scour and sediment deposition
processes; this system is similar to a sonar scanning approach [31].
The foundation of an o shore wind turbine constitutes approximately 35% of the installation
cost of such a turbine [ 32]. Construction sites for o shore wind farms are typically surveyed using
dierent investigation approaches or hydraulic models such as bathymetry, seismometry, and side-scan
sonar techniques before and after the main construction phase. However, as mentioned, the seabed
topography changes constantly because of sea currents. Because uncertainties regarding seabed erosion
and scour constitute a major risk for o shore wind farm development, the design and operation of
oshore wind turbines should mainly focus on addressing the uncertainty regarding the maximum

scour depth around the foundations of such turbines. In order to protect against the erosion of the
oshore wind turbine foundation, rock dump is usually laid to prevent removal of the sediment base.
However, edge scour still continues to occur despite the foundation protective devices installed [ 33].
With the advancement of artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence (AI) technology, machine learning (ML) and deep learning
(DL) will have a better contribution to o shore wind turbine condition monitoring [ 34‚Äì49]. ArtiÔ¨Åcial
intelligence (AI) is basically an algorithm for regression analysis of existing big data rules which
include machine learning, deep learning, genetic algorithm, neural network, and fuzzy. Generally, the
multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network is commonly used as an AI model prediction. Feature
extraction from the multiple linear regression (MLR) and multivariate nonlinear regression (MNLR)
properties of supervised and unsupervised learning need to compare with existing empirical equations.
To accurately predict the scouring process by means of inductive modeling, the AI modeling process
still requires a large amount of data as training, test, and viliÔ¨Åed dataset to analyze the sensitivity of
the model. Once the scour depth can be measured, empirical formulas for measuring scour processes
can be developed. Most of the current formulas are based on laboratory-based research models,
engineering design assessments, and measurement experience after in situ scouring. However, due
to the lack of reliable and durable instrumentation technology, scour data from real-time monitoring
systems is still insu cient.
An on-site scour monitoring system using visible light communication (VLC) for o shore wind
turbine is proposed in this paper. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the monitoring system consists of arrays of small VLC
modules attached directly to a pile structure and use the topology of the underwater optical wireless
sensor network to enable remote data acquisition. Experiments conducted in Ô¨Çumes have revealed
that the system was highly sensitive and accurate to monitor seabed scour processes. The proposed
robust sensory monitoring system has considered for further on-site applications and as an indicator to
improve the empirical scour formulas for sustainable maintenance in the life cycle of o shore structures.
2. Underwater VLC T urbidity and Velocity Characteristics
VLC, a novel free-space optical wireless communication technology, entails the combination
of white and colored light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to utilize visible light (375‚Äì780 nm) as
a transmission medium.
VLC is becoming an alternative choice for wireless technology because of its low operating cost,
low maintenance cost, long-term service stability, broad bandwidth, and ubiquitous infrastructure
support. Numerous studies have been conducted in both industry and academia to develop and
commercialize VLC systems. Particularly, underwater wireless communication is of great interest to
the marine industry and scientiÔ¨Åc society [ 50]. With the rapid development of solid-state lighting and
semiconductor technology, VLC modules equipped with LEDs as light sources are expected to be mass
produced at low cost. This technology has potential for use in a wide range of both indoor and outdoor
applications for free communication services. Indoor VLC for an optical wireless communication
system using LED lights was Ô¨Årstly proposed in 2004 with its high brightness, reliability, lower power
consumption, and long lifetime advantages [50].
Measuring water turbidity has been widely developed over the past few decades. Theoretically,
water turbidity was measured based on absorption, attenuation, and scattering e ects by using
spectrometers or photometric devices. For example, the acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) measured
the Ô¨Çowing velocity [ 51] while the optical laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV) [ 52] estimated the Doppler
frequency shift (DFS) of coherent sound or light caused by the particle concentration in water. However,
because of its size and inconvenient implementation, ADV and LDV are not suitable for measuring
seabed turbidity and scouring. For o shore wind turbine foundation scour monitoring, the attenuation
and absorption characters of the VLC measurement system in seawater, particularly the turbidity of
the scouring suspension particles, need to be studied Ô¨Årst.

Typically, Beer‚Äôs law (also known as Beer‚ÄìLambert law) is a well-known optical law and commonly
applied to derive the relationship in between absorption coe cient, optical path length, and the media
concentration in spectroscopy from a continuous wave [53,54].

VLC system implemented for underwater turbidity and scour laboratory demonstration in this
paper, a nearby 2 cm distance of transmitter and receiver are arranged for less multiple scattering e ects
and avoided long distance channel attenuation loss. However, there are higher power optical lasers
and higher intensity LEDs for long distance optical wireless communications (OWCs) which have less
length intensity dispersion and improved the channel scattering e ects [ 55]. A VLC system in the
order of 100‚Äì200 m, and up to 300 m has been used to transmit data in the water environment [ 56,57].
However, due to the properties of oceanic turbulence such as the suspended particles, salinity, and
temperature, the line-of-sight path attenuation loss is estimated by the radiative transfer equation
(RTE). The vector RTE, implies energy conservation of a light wave traversing a scattering medium,
is calculated by

Experimental results obtained in our previous study demonstrated the feasibility of the VLC
modules for executing both water turbidity and water Ô¨Çow velocity measurements [ 58]. To prevent the
eects of ambient light, the proposed system applies a sinusoidal signal to modulate the VLC module.
Figure 1 describes both the sinusoidal signal from the VLC transmitter and the interference signals from
ambient light sources, obtained on the receiver side. Normally, VLC modules operate at a frequency of
a few megahertz. The frequency of ambient light intensity changes is slower than that of the designed
sinusoidal signal, bandpass Ô¨Ålters implemented on the VLC receiver. Therefore, the VLC can receive
the in-band sinusoidal signal and eliminate the interference signals of out-of-band frequencies; thus,
the problems associated with ambient light interference are prevented in the proposed system.

2.1. Water Turbidity Measurement

Assume that y0is the reference RMS value of transparent water. The di erence between yRMS

Notably, Equation (4) is the attenuated power energy caused by the attenuated light path through
the turbid water. The proposed system applies DRMS to measure water turbidity.

2.3. Experimental Setup for Water Turbidity Measurement 
A sinusoidal signal with the frequency of 1 MHz was generated from the arbitrary waveform

was then obtained from the oscilloscope at a sampling rate of 1.024 Ghztf=  with a window size of 
10240tN= . From Equations (3) and (4), RMSŒî  values were computed. In this experiment, signal 
measurements were conducted at water turbidity le vels of 0, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, and 1200 ppm 
and at two water flow velocities of 83.14 q and 136.40 q, where 2(Liter) (second meter )q=√ó . 
2.4. Experimental Setup for Wa ter Flow Velocity Measurement 
As mentioned, the sinusoidal signal was genera ted from the AWG. Signals were captured on the 
oscilloscope using a sampling rate of 50 hzvf=  with a window size of 500vN=  to estimate the 
flowing velocity. The envelope of the received signal ÀÜvy was then calculated using Equation (5) and 
the DC-blocked frequency of the received signal DCy has computed from Equations (6)‚Äì(8). Finally, 
the Gaussian smoothing filter with a variance of 1.8 œÉ=  and a window size of 45L=  was 
substituted into the smoothed frequency Gy in Equation (9). The flowing velocities were set to be 
25.98 q, 83.14 q, and 136.40 q in the experiments. 
Figure 3a shows the received signals at turbidity le vels of 0, 200, 600, and 1000 ppm and at a 
water flow velocity of 83.14 q. The attenuation of the amplitude of  the received signals increased in

A sinusoidal signal with the frequency of 1 MHz was generated from the arbitrary waveform
generator (AWG) in this turbidity measurement and stayed an amplitude of 0.2 V . The received signal
was then obtained from the oscilloscope at a sampling rate of ft=1.024 Ghz with a window size of
Nt=10, 240 . From Equations (3) and (4), DRMS values were computed. In this experiment, signal
measurements were conducted at water turbidity levels of 0, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, and 1200 ppm
and at two water Ô¨Çow velocities of 83.14 qand 136.40 q, where q=(Liter)/(secondmeter2).
2.4. Experimental Setup for Water Flow Velocity Measurement
As mentioned, the sinusoidal signal was generated from the AWG. Signals were captured on
the oscilloscope using a sampling rate of fv=50hzwith a window size of Nv=500to estimate the
Ô¨Çowing velocity. The envelope of the received signal ÀÜyvwas then calculated using Equation (5) and the
DC-blocked frequency of the received signal yDChas computed from Equations (6)‚Äì(8). Finally, the
Gaussian smoothing Ô¨Ålter with a variance of =1.8and a window size of L=45was substituted
into the smoothed frequency yGin Equation (9). The Ô¨Çowing velocities were set to be 25.98 q, 83.14 q,
and 136.40 qin the experiments.
Figure 3a shows the received signals at turbidity levels of 0, 200, 600, and 1000 ppm and at
a water Ô¨Çow velocity of 83.14 q. The attenuation of the amplitude of the received signals increased in
accordance with the water turbidity levels. Figure 3b illustrates the relationship between DRMS values
and water turbidity levels at the water Ô¨Çow velocities of 83.14 qand 136.40 q. It seems that a linear

Figure 4 shows the turbidity effect in nephelometric units (NTU) of the output voltage value for 
VLC, blue LED, and infrared LED (IR LED). VLC turb idity data was tested in the flowing flume with 
suspension particles distribution while the blue LE D and IR LED turbidity data is obtained from the 
standard specimen. As shown in Figure 4, the VLC data have a slightly variated than the blue LED 
and IR LED, this variation is because the flowing su spension particles of the scattering, attenuation, 
and absorption effects have a significant influence on  the measurement in the water. It is well-known 
that the on-line resolution of the experiment prog ress is highly dependent on the measurement angle 
of the sensor between the transmitter and the receiver. In addition, the ambient indoor light would be a noise resource which affects the performance of VLC during the experiment progress. Despite the influence of these factors, the nonlinear nature of turbidity which actually responds in exponential form to the light intensity was obviously obtained from the VLC monitoring system.

Furthermore, RMSŒî  values computed at different flowing velo cities were approximately the same. It 
shows that RMSŒî  is independent of the flowing velocity in the experiment.

Figure 4 shows the turbidity effect in nephelometric units (NTU) of the output voltage value for 
VLC, blue LED, and infrared LED (IR LED). VLC turb idity data was tested in the flowing flume with 
suspension particles distribution while the blue LE D and IR LED turbidity data is obtained from the 
standard specimen. As shown in Figure 4, the VLC data have a slightly variated than the blue LED 
and IR LED, this variation is because the flowing su spension particles of the scattering, attenuation, 
and absorption effects have a significant influence on  the measurement in the water. It is well-known 
that the on-line resolution of the experiment prog ress is highly dependent on the measurement angle 
of the sensor between the transmitter and the receiver. In addition, the ambient indoor light would be a noise resource which affects the performance of VLC during the experiment progress. Despite the influence of these factors, the nonlinear nature of turbidity which actually responds in exponential form to the light intensity was obviously obtained from the VLC monitoring system.

3. VLC Scour Experiment
An experiment was conducted in a 6 m wide and 30 m long Ô¨Çume, as depicted in Figure 5. Eight
VLC sensors including the transmitter (Tx) and the receiver (Rx) were installed in the pier. Sensor 1
was located 5-cm below the bed surface. These sensors were arranged in two rows of eight sensors
separated by 5-cm intervals in the vertical direction. The sampling rate was set to 100 Hz to record
the time history throughout the scour experiment. Uniform sand with a diameter of 0.88 mm was
paved as the bed material in the Ô¨Çume. The approach velocity of the steady current was set to be
0.5 m /s. All dynamic data were monitored through the experimental setup shown in Figure 5. Figure 5
illustrates the scour responses recorded by individual sensors. These responses were further analyzed
using the proposed Hilbert‚ÄìHuang transform (HHT) process.

Figure 5. Hydraulic flume test an d experimental setup. 
Initially, all the sensors are em bedded in the soil and the transmit signal cannot be detected by 
the receiver sensors. At the early stage, the scou r depth increases significantly while inflow runs 
through the pier. As the embedded VLC sensor scoure d from the soil due to scour, the significant 
signal of the waveform can be easily obtained. An  obvious example of the sensors 3 and 4 is shown 
in Figure 6. The variation of waveform magnitude is  due to the turbidity and velocity of the turbulent 
flow that contains time-depended suspension particles.  As seen in Figure 6, the scour depth increases 
gradually after 1 h. Around 2.5 h, a total scour depth of 30 cm is measured in this test, which may be close to the equilibrium state. As experiment finis hed, the scour hole can be observed as shown in 
Figure 5.  A small camera recorded the scouring process as a comparison to valid the scour depth 
evolution measured by the VLC. An empirical scour formula with the nonlinear nature of flowing water which responds in exponential form to the light intensity for the VLC monitoring system is also obtained as shown in Figure 6.

4. HHT and Data Analysis 
4.1. Instantaneous Frequency 
Traditionally, a Fourier spectrum is evaluated us ing sine and cosine basis functions with a fixed 
amplitude. However, signals vary with time limitin g the applicability of the fast Fourier transform; 
moreover, obtaining the instantaneous frequency (IF)  at any specific time is impractical. For a 
structure affected by an earthquake, understanding the frequency variation is imperative. The Hilbert transform is widely used for nonlinear and nonstationary cases, facilitating the analysis of a time-varying signal. A measured signal can be expressed in the form of a complex number to determine the instantaneous amplitude a(t) and instantaneous phase Œ∏(t), and the IF œâ(t) can then be determined 
[59,60]. The Hilbert transform can be  defined as the convolution between X(t) and 1/ t. For any time 
series 
()XœÑ, the Hilbert transform Y(t) can be expressed as 
()() 1 XYt P dtœÑœÑœÄœÑ‚àû
‚àí‚àû=‚àíÔÉ≤  (10) 
where P represents the Cauchy principal value. 
Combining X(t) and Y(t) into a conjugate complex number yields an analytic signal Z(t)

According to the analysis, the time‚Äìfrequency‚Äìamplitude distribution of the time series can be

4.2. Empirical Mode Decomposition

4.1. Instantaneous Frequency
Traditionally, a Fourier spectrum is evaluated using sine and cosine basis functions with a Ô¨Åxed
amplitude. However, signals vary with time limiting the applicability of the fast Fourier transform;
moreover, obtaining the instantaneous frequency (IF) at any speciÔ¨Åc time is impractical. For a structure
aected by an earthquake, understanding the frequency variation is imperative. The Hilbert transform
is widely used for nonlinear and nonstationary cases, facilitating the analysis of a time-varying signal.
A measured signal can be expressed in the form of a complex number to determine the instantaneous
amplitude a(t) and instantaneous phase (t), and the IF !(t) can then be determined [ 59,60]. The Hilbert
transform can be deÔ¨Åned as the convolution between X(t) and 1 /t. For any time series X(), the Hilbert
transform Y(t) can be expressed as
Y(t)=1
P1Z
 1X()
t d (10)
where Prepresents the Cauchy principal value.
Combining X(t) and Y(t) into a conjugate complex number yields an analytic signal Z(t)
Z(t) =X(t) +iY(t) =a(t)ei(t)(11)
For example,
a(t) =q
X2(t) +Y2(t) (12)
(t) =tan 1(Y(t)/X(t)) (13)
!(t) =(d(t)/dt) (14)
According to the analysis, the time‚Äìfrequency‚Äìamplitude distribution of the time series can
be obtained.
4.2. Empirical Mode Decomposition
In contrast to other decomposition methods, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) does not
entail predetermining a basis function. In EMD, such a function is directly obtained from the signal
data; therefore, this method has considerable Ô¨Çexibility. EMD entails decomposing an original signal
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

into a Ô¨Ånite number of intrinsic mode function (IMF) components; speciÔ¨Åcally, a signal is approximated
as a sum of zero-mean amplitude modulation and frequency modulation components. The Ô¨Ånite
number of IMF components can be divided into high- and low-frequency partitions until a monotonic
function (trend) remains. The original data can be regarded as the sum of all IMF components and
trends. During analysis, if the time di erence between the extreme values represents the time scalar of
the intrawave, an optimal vibration modal resolution can be achieved and can be applied to nonzero
mean values as well as non-zero-crossing data. Thus, the original signal can be re-presented as
X(t)=nX
i=1ci+rn (15)
where Ciis the ith intrinsic mode functions; rnis the residual.
4.3. Ensemble EMD
EMD is often used as a signal disassembly method. EMD is used to decompose mixed signals
of dierent scales into di erent IMF components. However, a limitation of this approach is the
phenomenon called ‚Äòmode mixing‚Äô. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, during the EMD process, a low-amplitude oscillation
or an intermittent signal may exist in several IMF components; for example, a single modal component
may be decomposed into di erent IMF components, or a single IMF component may contain two
dierent modal signals, resulting in mode mixing within the IMF component. To solve this issue,
Ensemble EMD (EEMD) is proposed [ 61]. When EEMD is performed, a white noise wi(t) signal with
a limited amplitude is added to the original signal X(t); thus, the original signal is transformed as
Xi(t) =X(t)+wi(t) (16)
4.4. Hilbert Spectrum
As indicated in Equation (17), an IMF component can be converted from a time-domain to
a frequency-domain component; this process is called Hilbert spectral analysis (Figure 7)
X(t)=nX
j=1aj(t)exp 
iZ
!j(t)dt!
(17)
Although the Hilbert transform can process a monotonous trend and consider it a part of a longer
amplitude, the remaining energy may be excessively strong, considering the uncertainties of longer-term
trends and other low-energy elements and information contained in a high-frequency component. The
preceding formula provides a time function for each amplitude and frequency component, and this
formula can be expanded using a Fourier expression as
X(t)=1X
j=1ajei!jt(18)
where ajand wjare constants. Comparing Equations (17) and (18) reveals that the IMF can be
represented by a generalized Fourier expansion. Variables within the amplitude and the IF cannot only
improve the expansion but also render it applicable to unsteady signals. In terms of the expansion
of the IMF, the amplitude and the frequency modulation are clearly separated. The amplitude of the
time function and the IF can be combined as the time‚Äìfrequency‚Äìamplitude spectrum; this spectrum is
referred to as the Hilbert amplitude spectrum.

Figure 7. HHT calculation process. 
4.5. Analysis Results 
From recorded data, the time history data and HHT diagrams obtained for the first six sensors 
are plotted in Figure 8. The recorded time history is plotted on the top of each subplot and the corresponding Hilbert amplitude spectrum is shown in the bottom. The time-varying IF 
demonstrated nonlinear characteristics of the signals.  The x-axis represents the time history measured 
in seconds, and the energy density is illustrated at frequencies between 0 and 5 Hz, which contains the most energy of the vibration. 
The HHT diagram for channel 1 shown in Figure 8a  reveals a large energy distribution indicated 
by the significant yellow bar at approximately 90 s. This distribution can be attributed to the rapid jump in the time domain. Similarly, Figure 8b also reveals a yellow bar, indicating a sudden increase in the beginning of the time history. According to the color distribution in Figure 8b, more energy was covered in channel 2 than in channel 1, which fits well with the measured time histories. 
The HHT diagrams for channels 3 and 4 shown in Figure 8c,d, respectively, reveal a gradual 
shift of the yellow bar, which indicates the large variation section of energy in the time domain. Based 
on the result, the yellow bars in HHT diagrams can be  used to estimate the occurrence time of possible 
scour processes. Figure 8d indicates the scour phenomenon to occur between 150 and 200 s and then it continues till the end of the experiment; this figu re also reveals the energy distribution in channel 
4 to be greater than that in channel 3. 
Finally, as observed from the time history, significant vibration can be reflected from channel 5. 
Furthermore, the HHT diagram for channel 5 shown in Figure 8e reveals that the yellow energy bar 
is shifted to 300 s. It can be treated as a proper indicator to evaluate the scour depth, which follows 
the trend observed from the experiment. Additionally, the HHT diagram for channel 6 shown in Figure 8f reveals two peaks. In contrast to the ot her five sensors, the first yellow energy bar located 
at 300 s with the fundamental frequency between 0 and 2 Hz is not considered as scour phenomenon in the HHT diagram. As only slight energy is shown in the diagram, it can be neglected as a small vibration in the time domain. By combining Figures 7 and 8, a possible backbone scour curve can be 
established to provide a rapid estimation and ea rly warning for scour processes around a bridge.

reveals two peaks. In contrast to the other Ô¨Åve sensors, the Ô¨Årst yellow energy bar located at 300 s with
the fundamental frequency between 0 and 2 Hz is not considered as scour phenomenon in the HHT
diagram. As only slight energy is shown in the diagram, it can be neglected as a small vibration in the

5. Summary 
Offshore wind farms face more severe enviro nmental conditions such as severe storms, 
typhoons, ocean currents, and waves. Flow induce d scour around the foundation of structure is 
extremely complex. Scour leads to the excavation of  sediments, reducing the safe capacity of the 
structures. The phenomenon of pier scour combines the effects of the vortex system involving time-
dependent flow pattern and sediment transport me chanism. A real-time scour monitoring system 
can improve the safety of structures and afford cost -effective operations by preventing premature or 
unnecessary maintenance. Numerous studies have explored the mechanisms of hydraulic scour around foundations and have presented several form ulas for scour depth estimation around piers. 
However, scour data from real-time monitoring systems are still inadequate due to the lack of reliable 
and durable instrume ntation techniques.

data from real-time monitoring systems are still inadequate due to the lack of reliable and durable
instrumentation techniques.
Normally, water turbidity was measured based on absorption, attenuation, and scattering e ects
by using spectrometers or photometric devices. However, conventional estimation instruments are
usually bulky and costly. Experimental results obtained in this study demonstrated the feasibility of
the VLC modules for executing both water turbidity and water Ô¨Çow velocity measurements.
According to the results of the underwater turbidity and water Ô¨Çow velocity experiments, the
communication light path of the VLC modules can be sensitively a ected by turbulent movement
of particles in water. These notable phenomenon e ects could be further implemented as an early
warning structural health monitoring system by conducting real-time scour measurement and Hilbert
transform analysis. In this present study, an on-site scour monitoring system for o shore wind turbines
has been proposed; speciÔ¨Åcally, the monitoring system consists of arrays of small VLC modules
attached directly to a pile foundation structure and linked to a wireless network to enable remote
data acquisition has demonstrated. From the Ô¨Çume experiment results, it revealed that the system
was highly sensitive to seabed scour processes. The proposed robust sensory monitoring system has
considered for further on-site applications and as an indicator to improve the empirical scour formulas
for sustainable maintenance in the life cycle of o shore structures.
From the result analysis, the VLC ray is easily a ected by the suspended particles in the water
and the turbidity, especially in the scouring process. Hence, the proposed arrayed-transmission
measurement method will be limited by the turbidity e ect. In the future work, it may be necessary to
cooperate with the reÔ¨Çection approach, as a supplement comparison, for simultaneous measuring the
back-scattering characters. Combining these two transmission and back-scattering implementations
would provide a better real-time approach to measure and discriminate turbidity, Ô¨Çow velocity, and
scour depth. These data can be useful to establish a local scouring formula to evaluate structural safety.
