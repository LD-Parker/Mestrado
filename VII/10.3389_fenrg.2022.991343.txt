As large wind farms are now often operating far from the shore, remote
condition monitoring and condition prognostics become necessary to avoid
excessive operation and maintenance costs while ensuring reliable operation.

and2)steadier wind supply, which makes power generation
more reliable. These two factors combined dramatically
improve the return on investment (ROI) of such wind farms
(Windpower Learning Centre, 2019 ).
While wind farms were initially installed mainly in coastal
areas with shallow waters, nowadays offshore wind farms are
increasinglydeployedindeepwaters( ∼200 mdepth)andfurther
awayfromtheshore( ∼60 km)(Walsh, 2019 ;Keene, 2021 ).This
leads to higher Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) and Operational
& Maintenance (O&M) costs/Operational Expenditure (OPEX)
(Castellà, 2020 ).Infact,O&Mcosts/OPEXmayaccountforupto
30%oftheLevelisedCostofEnergy(LCoE)( May et al., 2015 ).
To reduce O&M costs/OPEX, advanced maintenance
strategies like Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) or
Predictive Maintenance (PdM) need to be adopted to minimise
the downtime (i.e., maximise the availability) of OWTs while
performing all necessary maintenance actions. These advanced
maintenancestrategiesrequiretechnologiessuchassensingand
monitoring systems, algorithms and software tools to process
measured data for faults detection and remaining useful life
(RUL) prediction, and software tools for decision making.
Since the last decade, the development and deployment of
such technologies to support the implementation of CBM/PdM
strategy for onshore and offshore wind farms have been mainly
focused on critical rotating components such as gearboxes,
generators, blades, etc. ( Crabtree, 2011 ;Kandukuri et al., 2016 ;
Turnbull and Carroll, 2021 ). Different from the critical rotating
componentsmentionedabove,thecurrentmaintenancestrategy
typically employed for corrosion of wind turbine structures is
time-based maintenance, where manual, on-site inspections by
a maintenance team are carried out periodically (e.g., yearly),
whichsignificantlycontributestowardsthetotalO&Mcost.
Since OWTs are exposed to harsh and corrosive
environmental conditions, corrosion is a main root cause for
offshore structure failure ( Martinez-Luengo et al., 2016 ;Price
andFigueira, 2017 ).Improperordegradedcorrosionprotection
andinadequatemanagementcanresultinstructuraldegradation
and even catastrophic failure. Therefore, it is vital for the
implementation of CBM and PdM strategies to (also) cover
corrosionofOWTstructures.
Intheliterature,reviewscanbefoundregardingdiagnostics
and prognostics of low-speed bearings and planetary gearboxes
in wind turbines ( Kandukuri et al., 2016 ) and regarding
corrosion fatigue in OWT structures ( Adedipe et al., 2016 ).
In this paper we provide a review of the relatively new
and increasingly important research area of diagnostics and
prognostics of corrosion of OWT structures. While this topic is
also considered in Abbas and Shafiee (2020) , in this paper we
mainly focus on evaluating and comparing various monitoring
and prognosis techniques. To this end, we present an integral
way the state-of-the-art of corrosion monitoring and prognosis
solutions:fromtheunderstandingofthecorrosionphenomenonand its modeling, to corrosion monitoring techniques and the
use of the acquired data for corrosion prognosis, analysing the
most suitable and cost-effective sensors and techniques for the
applicationofOWTstructures.
This paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we give
an overview of the corrosion mechanisms, corrosion protection
techniques, and empirical models that describe corrosion loss
over time. In Section 3 we consider corrosion monitoring
techniquesandsystems,andtheirsuitabilityforOWTstructures.
Then, in Section 4 , we consider corrosion prognosis methods
for the estimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in the
context of OWT structures. Moreover, we relate corrosion
prognosiswithmaintenancestrategiesforO&Mcostreduction.
InSection 5 , we analyse the most-suitable corrosion prognosis
strategy intended for OWT structures. Finally, we provide a
conclusionin Section 6 .
2Corrosion mechanisms and
models
In this section, we first recall corrosion mechanisms and
common corrosion protection systems. Later, we review a
numberofempiricalcorrosionmodels.
2.1 Corrosion mechanisms
One of the limiting states for the serviceability of Offshore
Wind Turbines (OWTs), is corrosion that reduces structural
integrity and durability of structural and non-structural
components. The harshness of the offshore environment does
not come as a surprise. Atmospheric corrosion in general
accounts for more than half of the annual cost of global Gross
domestic product (GDP)—which is estimated at approximately
3.8%—according to recent analysis of all types of corrosion
(Chico et al., 2017 ;Hou et al., 2017 ;Koch, 2017 ). And as gas
and oil installations have performed under such conditions
for decades, much knowledge has been accumulated about
the strict measures needed to be taken to mitigate corrosion
before leading to catastrophic failures ( Momber, 2011 ). In fact,
the protection philosophy adopted for OWTs copies mostly the
strategiesimplementedforgasandoilinstallations.
Today, the corrosion protection for OWT structures, and
for the design basis, is well described in the design codes
and semi-empirical correlations developed by certification
authorities such as DNV and American Petroleum Institute
(API). DNV is involved in 90% of all offshore wind
farms worldwide as a certification provider. The relevant
DNV Standards and Recommended practice documents
that address the corrosion protection needed for OWTs
regarding their structural integrity, can be found in

DNV (DNV, 2014 ;DNV, 2021a ;DNV, 2021b ;DNV, 2021c ;
DNV, 2021d ;DNV, 2021e ;DNV, 2021f ;DNV, 2021g ).
The chosen corrosion protection system shall be applicable
forthespecifieddesignandoperatingandsurvivaltemperatures
of the support structures, according to DNV-RP-0363
(DNV, 2021a ). Corrosion control includes, according to
DNV-RP-0416( DNV, 2021b ),thefollowing:
•Corrosionallowance(CA).
•Cathodicprotection(CP).
•Corrosionprotectivecoatings.
Corrosionprotectivecoatingsaremadeofmetallic,inorganic
or organic materials, applied to a metal’s surface, in this context
is steel, to prevent corrosion. The coating systems employed for
wind farm corrosion control have been developed during the
last decades through valuable experience from the offshore oil
and gas industry ( Weinell et al., 2017 ). Although these coating
systems may have passed qualification tests, many other factors
are decisive on the performance and durability of the coatings.
Erroneousapplicationofthecoatingortheproductionofdefects
during the installation and servicing of the wind turbine, result
in defects, failures or scratches, exposing the metal to sea water
which causes corrosion. In addition, coatings also experience
ageinganddegradationwithtime,henceinareaswherethebare
steelisexposed,corrosionwillcommence.Thisisinparticulara
realisticscenariointhesplashzone.
Indeed, experience indicates a shorter lifetime of coatings
than the recommended 20 years of designed life for OWTs.
According to DNV-RP-0416 ( DNV, 2021b ), the coating lifetime
in the splash zone can be expected to be only 10 years for the
NORSOK M-501 Coating system no. 7A intended for splash
zone protection, although longer lifetimes have been achieved
(Momber, 2011 ).
Inthesplashzone,thestructureisintermittentlyexposedto
seawater due to tide or waves, and thus the corrosivity of this
zoneisseentobeparticularlyharshonthemetals,eventhough
coated. In addition, maintenance is not practical and in many
cases omitted. Also, Cathodic Protection (CP) is not effective
at all times for parts of this splash zone. CP is a technique to
prevent corrosion of steel immersed in seawater by applying a
protective cathodic current, either by sacrificial anodes or by
an Impressed Current CP (ICCP). Today’s cathodic protection
is well established through DNV-RP-B401 ( DNV, 2021c ) and
estimated values for protection are chosen based on tabulated
standard values. However, according to experiences gained in
Norway and Denmark, several CP failures have been identified,
resulting in corrosion allowance being consumed faster than
expected ( Osvoll, 2011 ;Weinell et al., 2017 ;Nøhr-Nielsen and
Mathiesen, 2018 ).
Hence,CorrosionAllowance(CA)isanimportantcorrosion
control method together with applied current for cathodic
protection. CA is an extra wall thickness that is added whendesigning the structure, to compensate for any reduction of the
thickness by corrosion. For primary steel structures (structures
where failure has significant consequences, such as a tower or
flanges) the CA can be calculated from the specified corrosion
rates in DNV-RP-0416 ( DNV, 2021b ,Section 7 ). The equation
states:
CA=Vcorr(TD−TC) (1)
where Vcorris the maximum expected corrosion rate, TCis
the expected useful design lifetime of the coating and TDis the
designlifetimeofthestructure.
Both the corrosion rate and the useful coating lifetime are
heavily affected by the corrosivity of the environment, and it
is acknowledged that it is critical to both understand what to
expect, but also to document the actual corrosivity. Fatigue
calculations for design of wind turbine support structures, are
based on a steel wall thickness—defined as the critical wall
thickness—equal to the nominal wall thickness of which half
of the corrosion allowance is completely lost over the full
service life without decommissioning phase, see DNV-ST-0126
(DNV, 2021f ). A wall thickness smaller than the critical wall
thicknesscanconsequentlyleadtotheappearanceofcatastrophic
structural failures, depending on the design philosophy chosen,
i.e., on the safety factors used for the fatigue design, see
information in DNV-ST-0126 ( DNV, 2021f ). Therefore, for
diagnosis and prognosis of wind turbine structural defects
caused by corrosion, both the historical and the actual wall
thicknessarerequired,e.g.,by in-situthicknessmeasurementand
monitoring.
The corrosivity of the environment is defined in several
standards. In ISO 9223 ( ISO, 2012a ), the atmospheric
environments are classified into six atmospheric-corrosivity
categories, C1 to C6, representing an increasing harshness of
the environment when moving from dry salinity-free onshore
conditions, to wet and salt-influenced offshore conditions.
According to the standard, three environmental parameters
are responsible for driving the corrosion process, namely:
1)the effect of time of wetness (TOW), 2)the sulphur
dioxide concentration or deposition rate, and 3)the sodium
chloride deposition rate. In addition, the standard ISO 12944–9
(ISO, 2018 ), also addresses various immersed conditions in the
classes Im1 to Im4, and the extreme atmospheric conditions
offshore,givenastheCXcorrosivityclass.
For OWTs, two corrosivity classes—CX-offshore and
Im2/Im4—must be taken in account when planning the
corrosion protection strategy, according to ISO 12944–2
(ISO, 2017 ). CX includes offshore areas with high salinity
for tidal, splash and atmospheric zones. Im2 is for the
zones permanently submerged in seawater without cathodic
protection, while Im4 are with cathodic protection ( ISO, 2017 ;
Masi et al., 2019 ). However, in the splash zone, these two
conditions meet in a synergistic way. While below sea level the

average corrosion rate is measured at 0.2 mm per year, in the
splash zone and tidal zone, corrosion rates may be from 0.4 to
1.2 mmperyear( HigginsandFoley, 2014 ).
Based on empirical and experimental data from
literature reviews, it becomes clear that the most important
environmental factors affecting the corrosion process of
carbon steels under marine immersion conditions are sea
water temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration and flow
velocity ( Guedes Soares et al., 2011 ). The variation in salinity
in open-ocean surface is typically between 32 and 37.6 ppt.
In this range, the corrosion of steel alloys that typically
corrode uniformly—as carbon steels—is not seen to be
significantly affected ( Melchers, 2006 ;2009), whereas changes
in oxygen concentration and temperature are seen to be more
critical. Indeed, temperature affects corrosion kinetics, oxygen
concentration and diffusion ( Sørensen et al., 2009 ). It has been
observed that at a temperature of 25°C, the corrosion of
carbon steel in sea water was nearly doubled when compared
with the corrosion at 10°C ( Guedes Soares et al., 2011 ). The

believedthatwhetherthematerialisahighorlowcarbonsteel,or
similarlyalowalloysteel,castiron,orcoldrolledmildsteel,the
measured corrosion rates are essentially the same—at a specific
site—forallcarbonsteelsimmersedinseawater( Melchers, 2006 ;
Guedes Soares et al., 2011 ).
In contrast, in offshore marine atmospheric conditions,
the corrosion mechanism is initiated with the metallic surface
becoming wet, and corrosion then propagates—under certain
conditions at even higher rates—during the drying of the
water layer before halting upon complete drying. The wet
phase is ascribed either to a condensation process due to
changes in temperatures, or due to the hygroscopic effect of
surface contaminants like dust and salts ( Koushik et al., 2021 ).
However, also fog, rain and melting snow, contribute to thewetness. Eventually, the formation of droplets and a thin
layer of electrolyte will take place ( Simillion et al., 2014 ). The
corrosion process will hence take place each time the metallic
surface is wet, and the rate will be strongly influenced by
several variables. An abundant literature has been published
for prediction of corrosion rates from meteorological and
pollution parameters (atmospheric conditions) ( ISO, 2012a ;b;
Klinesmith et al., 2007 ).
Inbothatmosphericandimmersedconditions,carbonsteels
mainly corrode uniformly, with a homogeneously distributed
metal loss over the surface. However, localized corrosion
may also develop on a surface initially corroding uniformly
(Khodabux et al., 2020 ),explainedduetoeffectsfrombiological
organisms in the sea water and the built-up of corrosion
products. Non-uniform corrosion mechanisms happen when
the electrochemical cell is distributed in an abnormal way over
the surface of the metal, such that anodic and cathodic sites
differ in size, resulting in an accelerated localized loss of metal
and the formation of cavities and holes. Local differences with
respect to oxygen access will cause differences in potential and
pH and result in the initiation of localized accelerated cells,
consistent with the theory of differential aeration corrosion
(Melchers, 2013 ). Hence surfaces initially corroding uniformly,
may develop non-uniform corrosion. Nonetheless, in order for

about the types of corrosion that are expected in the different
corrosionzones.
To add to the complexity of predicting corrosion rates,
bacteria life at the offshore site may cause marine growth on
immersed structural components, while the highest is actually
seen in the splash zone. This growth can affect not only the
geometry,surfacetextureandtheaccessibilityofthecomponent,

acceleratedand 2)fieldtesting.Thelimitationofthefirsttesting
method is that the conditions of the accelerated corrosion tests
maynotnecessarilyberepresentativefortherealenvironmental
conditions, or the degradation mechanisms happening in real
life. The limitation of the second testing method is that it takes
manyyears,about10–20years,tocompletethetest.
To model corrosion, the electrochemical process must be
translated into mathematical equations—which require several
simplificationsandassumptionstobemade.Themajorconcern
in making the correct assumptions is the multi-scale nature of
corrosionandthereforetheneedofmanymodelparametersthat
will limit the validity window of the model. In addition, many
differentenvironmentalsituationsneedtobetakenintoaccount
bythemodels.Thecomplexityofthemodelwillthusbedefined
by the amount of parameters chosen to be included. For long
time and length scales, empirical modelling may be suited as it
is not computational expensive and presents valid solutions as
long as changes in the corrosion mechanism can be excluded
(Melchers, 2006 ;2018).
Extensive overviews of the advances in atmospheric
corrosion modeling can be found in Klinesmith et al. (2007) ;
Morcillo et al. (2013) ;Simillion et al. (2014) . In this section we
review various empirical models for corrosion degradation
highlightedintheliterature.Themajorityofcorrosionmodelsfor
bothimmersedandatmosphericconditions,havebeenexpressed
aspower-law models in the form of ( Klinesmith et al., 2007 ;

where Mis the total accumulated corrosion at time t,t
is the exposure time, Kis the corrosion value of year one,
whilenis a mass loss component - usually less than unity. The
latter represents the effects of all other factors that affect the
corrosion process, including environmental conditions, and is
usually estimated using a log-linear regression analysis of the
measureddata( Klinesmith et al., 2007 ).
Although these models incorporate the effect of exposure
conditions, the corrosion loss is predicted as a function
of time only. As a consequence, the variation related to
environmental conditions, will only appear as error variations
in these time-dependent models. A model for long-term
exposure in atmospheric conditions that incorporates multipleenvironmentaladjustmentfactorsinadditiontothetimefactor,
isproposedin Klinesmith et al. (2007) .

andc1,…,c9are empirical constants. This formula represents
the fact that while sulfur dioxide and chloride are catalysts for
corrosion, humidity is requiredfor corrosion. In the case of
OWTs,theconcentrationofsulfurdioxidecanbeassumedtobe

However, these most common approaches of modelling the
lossofametallicsurfaceduetocorrosion,havebeensignificantly
criticized in later years since the corrosion process is over-
simplified taking into account only the oxidation of the steel
produced by the arrival of oxygen to the corroding surface
(Melchers, 2009 ). In general, data have been found to deviate
from the relation described by Eqs. 2,3, as it was observed that
actualhighinitialcorrosionrateswoulddecreasegraduallywith

However, existing models are to be regarded as incomplete,

without considering the dynamic change of the electrode
geometry and effect of the consequent changes in the
local environment—which are critical for locally accelerated
corrosion. Some attempts have however been done the
last years to model dynamic film variations, as well as the
effect of corrosion products ( Simillion et al., 2014 ;2016;
Gießgen et al., 2019 ).
2.3 Corrosion in offshore wind turbine
structures
From the discussion in previous subsections, we found out
that:
•ExperiencesfromexistingOWTfarmssuggestthatcoating
lifetime is highly dependable both on the workmanship
duringtheapplicationofthecoatingandinstallationofthe
turbines, but as well on the corrosivity of the environment,
acknowledgedtobeacriticalfactoralsoforthesubsequent
corrosionofthesteel.
•Although carbon steels corrode mainly uniformly, and
CP is applied on OWTs from the splash zone and down
into immersed conditions, CP failures (due to unforeseen
factorsnotcoveredbystandardstogetherwithunfavourable
conditions resulting in high localized corrosion rates) may
lead to faster consumption rates of employed corrosion
allowances.
•Corrosion models are necessary, together with input from
real service corrosion rates, in order to mitigate risks for
fatigue failures. We presented some well-known empirical
corrosion models employed for uniform corrosion, and
discussed how corrosion mechanisms may affect the
expected corrosion rates. These models are essential for
corrosion prognosis, discussed in Sections 4 and5. Inparticular, the bi-modal model seems to describe well the
corrosionbehaviourinOWTstructures.
3Corrosion monitoring
Aspreviouslydiscussedin Section 2.1 ,inadequatecorrosion
management in offshore can lead to significant maintenance
costs or even catastrophic corrosion failures. Therefore, a
methodical and frequent corrosion inspection or continuous
corrosion monitoring method has to be applied. Corrosion
monitoring requires frequent unattended inspections, whereas
corrosion inspection is carried out much less frequently with
oneinspectionduringatimeperiod.Foracorrosionprominent
environmentasoffshoreandpossiblesituationswherecorrosion
may not be detected before leakage, crack, or fatigue of
the structure, it is important to have a systematic corrosion
monitoring approach to detect the very slow progress of
corrosionratherthananinspectionroutine.
This section is organised as follows. Section 3.1 presents
sensors and techniques used for corrosion detection. In
Section 3.2 Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) based corrosion
monitoringandworksfoundinliteratureforpossiblecorrosion
monitoring solutions are presented. Focusing on corrosion
monitoring in Offshore Wind Turbines (OWTs), appropriate
design parameters for a corrosion monitoring system, and
challenges to be encountered are discussed in Sections 3.3 and
3.4respectively.
3.1 Structural health monitoring sensors
and techniques: Corrosion detection
Offshore O&M is a key discipline in structural health
monitoring ( Yang et al., 2018 ). In O&M tasks, it is important
to detect material degradation due to corrosion phenomena
which can be done by employing various types of sensors and
techniques. Corrosion is detected by sensing different physical
parameters based on their operating principle such as mass
loss, corrosion currents, wall thickness changes, leak vibrations,
surface discontinuities, cracks, or strain changes of the test
material.
Corrosion measurements can be performed in several
modes:
•Offline:asampleistakenforthetestingprocess,
•In-line: install testing equipment with direct contact to the
fluidofthecorrosionprocessandretrievethesensorprobe
fortheanalysis,
•Online: installation of testing probes in the field for
continuous measurements of mass loss or corrosion rate

equipmenttoaccessthedata,

monitoring system can be accessed remotely. Literature

The corrosion progress is observed by comparing
the difference between measurements over some time
duration ( National Association of Corrosion Engineers, 1999 ;
Kane, 2007 ). When the interval between consecutive
measurements is large (e.g., months), the possibility of
early detection of any corrosion becomes less probable.
Therefore, continuous and frequent corrosion measurements
give important information useful for early prevention and
corrosioncontrolactions.
3.1.1 Corrosion detection techniques and
sensors
Corrosion sensors and corrosion detection techniques are
key elements in corrosion management. Available types of
sensors and related techniques for corrosion assessment are
discussednext.
•Coupons for mass loss technique Corrosion can be
monitored with the use of “probes” inserted and exposed
to the corrosive environment for a specific time period.
These corrosion probes can be either mechanical,
electrical, or electrochemical. The conventional method
for corrosion detection evaluates any weight loss based on
the changes that happened to the test specimen geometry
(Wright et al., 2019 ). The corrosion coupons are the probes
used in this type of testing and have been widely used in
theindustryformanyyears.Couponsaremadeofthesame
materialastheobjectbeingtested,withsuitableweightand
shape, and are exposed to the corrosion environment for a
specific time period. The weight loss and data processing
must be completed offline after withdrawing the coupons
by trained staff ( Kansara et al., 2018 ). Corrosion rate given
inthismethodisanaveragevalueforspecificexposedtime
duration and no real-time information is provided. The
electrical version of the corrosion coupons are Electrical
Resistance (ER) probes and they monitor corrosion in
real-time using the electrical resistance parameter. The
principle of this method is measuring the mass loss that
happens in metallic probe/wire exposed to a corrosive
environment based on the changes in electrical resistance
duetocorrosionproducts( Soh et al., 2016 ).TheERprobescan provide online corrosion rate information using
embeddeddeviceswithcommunicationcapabilitiesbutthe
main drawbacks of ER probes are that they need exposure
tothesameenvironmentalconditionsofinterest(e.g.,same
temperature,chemistry,flowregime),theprobeshavetobe
replaced frequently due to the weight loss they experience
while immersed in the corrosive environment, and the
sensitivityleveldependsontheprobedesign.
•Electrochemical sensors and techniques The corrosion
process is mostly a natural electrochemical phenomenon.
Hence, electrochemical sensors are used in corrosion
detection by evaluating the electrochemical characteristics
of the corroding material. The five most used
electrochemical methods in corrosion detection are Open
circuit potential (OCP), Linear polarized resistance (LPR),
Galvanostatic pulse method, Resistivity method, and
Electrochemical noise (EN). Electrochemical techniques
(Holcomb et al., 2001 ) generally rely on measuring
potentials and current densities with special electrodes
introducedintheenvironmentwherecorrosionmonitoring
is needed. The actual structure metal is not usually a part
of the measurement circuit/setup. Their main advantage
is that they can directly measure the corrosion rate and
therefore continuous monitoring is possible. But these
methodscanalterthecorrosionprocessandareconsidered
an intrusive technique ( Perkins, 2005 ). Furthermore, the
type of electrodes compatible with the process must be
carefully selected for each application to have enough
sensitivity for corrosion measurements. Normally these
solutionscannotbeleftunattendedforlongperiodsoftime
in contact with the fluids that are producing the corrosion
(National Association of Corrosion Engineers, 1999 ;Xia
etal.,2021 ).
•Magnetic sensors and techniques If the test material
showssomeconductiveproperties,electromagneticsensors
can be used to detect corrosion by employing them in
electromagnetic testing methods such as Magnetic Flux
Leakage (MFL), Eddy Current (EC) method, Pulse eddy
currentmethod,andMagneticParticleInspection.
Magneticsensorsmeasuremagneticfluxormagneticflux
density changes. The oldest and most common magnetic
sensors are known as detector coils or pickup coils which
are a combination of excitation and receiver coils and used
todetectcorrosionbasedonmagneticfluxchangesacrossits
coil.TheiroperationisbasedonFaraday’slawofinduction.
Thesensitivityofthesesensorsdependsonnumberofturns,
permeability and section diameter ( Watson, 2021 ). The
transmitter coil of the sensor is excited with an alternating
current to produce an alternating magnetic field which
induces eddy currents in the surface of test material. The
presence of defects or discontinuities in the surface/near-
surface that are caused by corrosion can be inspected via

the combined effect of the primary electromagnetic field
with the secondary magnetic field from the eddy current.
Thechangesthatoccurduetocorrosionwillinduceaphase
shift, magnitude changes in electrical conductivity, and
magneticpermeabilityofthecombinedeffect.Thisisknown
as the Eddy Current (EC) technique in non-destructive
testing (García-Martín et al., 2011 ). In EC, the excitation
signalisappliedasasinglefrequencyorsequenceofsignals
with multi frequencies. Improving EC technique further,
the pulsed eddy-current (PEC) technique has introduced
with use of an excitation signal with a pulse of selected
frequency and pulse width. PEC has potential to apply
combination of multi-frequencies in the excitation pulse
which have then the potential to inspect multiple depths
simultaneously reducing the inspection time compared to
EC(He et al., 2012 ;Sophian et al., 2017 ).
InRoach and Nelson (2007) a novel electromagnetic
sensor called Magnetic carpet probe (MCP) is presented.
It is based on Remote Field Eddy Current (RFEC) and
it is designed to be mounted as an in-situapplication
sensor. These sensors are made of flexible PCBs (Printed
Circuit Boards) with highly dense printed coil. Corrosion
is detected using the remote field eddy current technique.
It has been observed that they are capable to generate
a stronger magnetic field compared to conventional eddy
current excitation. However, there is no evidence that the
solutionhasbeentestedinarelevantenvironment.Theaim
ofthesetestswastoevaluatethesensorperformanceduring
thedevelopmentstage.
SQUID (Superconducting quantum interference device)
isanothertypeofelectromagneticsensorsdesignedtodetect
very low magnetic induction levels during eddy current
testing. Though these sensors have very good sensitivity,
theiruseislimitedinmanycorrosiondetectionapplications
as they need highly controlled conditions to operate (e.g.,
temperature)( Bellingham et al., 1987 ).
Hall effect sensors are widely used types of
electromagnetic sensors to detect the presence and
magnitude of a magnetic field. These sensors are operating
based on the hall effect produced by sensing the magnetic
flux.Basedonitsoperatingprinciple,thesesensorsareused
to detect the flux leakage of Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL)
NDT method. In the MFL method, the testing conductive
materialismagnetizedbyapplyingamagneticfield,andthe
leaked magnetic field lines out of the material surface due
tothepresenceofanydefectisdetectedandconvertedinto
an electrical signal by hall effect sensors ( Shi Y. et al., 2015 ;
Shams et al., 2018 ). Magneto-resistive sensors are another
typeofelectromagneticsensorusedtodetectfluxleakagein
MFL technique. Their operation is based on the magneto-
resistance property which exhibits a linear change in the
resistance of its material under an external magnetic field(Jander et al., 2005 ). These sensors are capable of detecting
low-frequency and multi-frequency eddy currents during
electromagnetic material testing. While these sensors are
highlysensitiveandaccurate,theyhaveahigh-temperature
coefficient( García-Martín et al., 2011 ).
The advantages of these electromagnetic sensors and
techniques (EC and MFL) are the tests can be performed
without contact, can measure through coatings and
insulating materials, and is suitable for outdoor operations.
Limitations with magnetic sensors and techniques are that
testmaterialneedstobeconductive,depthofpenetrationis
limited(inspectionislimitedtosurfaceornear-surface),the
resultsdependontheelectromagneticpropertiesofthetest
material,thesensibilityandresolutionofthemeasurements
are very dependent on the distance between the excitation
coils, and the test material ( Hernandez-Valle et al., 2014 ;
Shi Y. et al., 2015 ;Sophian et al., 2017 ) and the results can
beaffectedbyotherelectromagneticfields.
•Acousticsensorsandtechniques One of the most popular
non-destructive types of corrosion detection sensors is
acoustic sensors, which are capable of evaluating the
material’smassandchangesingeometry.Themostcommon
type of acoustic sensor is a piezoelectric sensor/transducer.
Piezoelectric sensors are capable of measuring vibrations
in the form of force, stress/strain, pressure, temperature, or
acoustic emission, and converting them into a measurable
electric signal. The most significant characteristic of
these sensors is that they can convert mechanical energy
into electrical energy and, conversely, electrical energy
into mechanical energy ( Taheri, 2019 ). They are capable
of generating high-frequency acoustic waves using an
excitation electric pulse/pulses and evaluating a material
through its mechanical vibrations ( Wright et al., 2019 ). In
ultrasound (US) corrosion detection technique, a high-
frequency sound wave is generated using a piezoelectric
sensorandtransmittedthroughthetestmaterialtoevaluate
any discontinuities or thickness loss. The time difference
betweenthereferencesignalandthetransmittedorreflected
partofthesignal(basedondifferentacousticimpedance)is
converted into a defect/thickness loss ( Kansara et al., 2018 ;
Herraiz et al., 2019 ;Thibbotuwa et al., 2022 ). The advan-
tages of the US technique are that tests can be performed
fast and accurately, and inspection is possible for higher
thicknessesinbothconductiveandnon-conductiveobjects.
The major limitation is that small or thin materials are
difficult to test, and it is very sensitive to the quality of
the contact between the piezoelectric sensor and the test
material.
In US method, contact is needed between the test piece
and sensor. To overcome this constraint, there are few
methodsbasedonnon-contactacousticwavegenerationin
atestmaterial,suchaselectromagneticacoustictransducers
Frontiers in Energy Research 08 frontiersin.org
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Brijder et al. 10.3389/fenrg.2022.991343
EMATs (Electromagnetic Acoustic Testing), air (gas)
coupled systems, and optical interferometric detection
(Green Jr, 2004 ). Among them, use of EMAT transducers
are a quite popular method that generates acoustic waves
with no contact using electromagnetic induction. They
consist of two major components: a magnet to generate
a low frequency or static magnetic field and an electric
coil with alternating current to generate a relatively high-
frequencyfield.Interactionofthesetwomagneticfieldswill
generate a Lorentz force and obtain a mechanical vibration
in the solid lattice creating an ultrasound wave. However,
in comparison with piezoelectric transducers, the EMAT
transducershavelowerefficiencyduringenergyconversion,
and the size of the transducer is relatively large because it
consists of bulky and powerful magnets or electromagnets
(Green Jr, 2004 ;Hernandez-Valle et al., 2014 ).
Acoustic Emission (AE) is a non-destructive material
testing method based on detecting the transient elastic
waves in a sudden redistribution of stress in a material
(Faisal et al., 2017 ;Yue et al., 2021 ). Energy released by
AE localized sources (e.g., crack, slip or dislocation
movements,orphasetransformationsinmetals)propagates
through test material which is received by the AE sensor.
The conventional AE sensors are made of piezoelectric
material that are generally sensitive to exciting frequencies
between 20 and 400 kHz ( Vallen Systeme GmbH, 2017 ).
With the aim of improving the signal-to-noise ratio
of conventional piezoelectric AE sensors, Micro-Electro
Mechanical Systems (MEMS) acoustic emission sensors
have been developed. Moreover, they have significant
reduced size and weight compared to conventional AE
sensors ( Ozevin, 2020 ). The AE technique has potential
to quantify cracks and leaks, but have limitations in the
responsedependingonthesourceintensity/energyreleased.
Moreover, it offers limited repeatability of measurements,
only detects active/growing defects, and the presence of
noiselimitsthesensitivityconsiderably.
•Thermography Thermal cameras are sensing devices used
to measure the rate of heat emission of surfaces emitted by
objects. Imaging with a wavelength in the infrared range
(0.7–300 microns wavelength) is known as Infrared (IR)
Thermography (TH). IR cameras sense the IR radiation
emitting from a test object ( Jönsson et al., 2010 ). Both
thermal and IR cameras are employed to detect corrosion
in two possible ways: passive and active. In the passive
method, thermal energy or IR radiation emitted by the
inspecting surface/object is monitored, and in the active
method,additionallyanexternalsourceisusedtostimulate
the heat flow inside the object ( Theodorakeas et al., 2015 ).
As heat diffuses through the structure, the measured
temperature distribution gives information about defects
orthickness( GrinzatoandVavilov, 1998 ).Recentliteratureshowsthatbasedonthewayofheatstimulation,thiscanbe
categorized as optical thermography ( Jönsson et al., 2010 ;
Doshvarpassand et al., 2019 ), induction thermography
(Cadelano et al., 2016 ;Tian et al., 2016 ), vibration
thermography ( Doshvarpassand et al., 2019 ), microwave
thermography ( Foudazi et al., 2015 ), and laser
thermography( Hwang et al., 2019 ).
•Radio frequency identification sensors (RFID sensors)
Radio-FrequencyIdentification(RFID)sensorsareanother
sensor type which have been used for structural health
monitoring and can be used for corrosion detection.
Typical way of corrosion detection based on RFID
sensors consists of shielding RFID tags (transponders)
with corrosion sensitive element and evaluates how the
communication response characteristics sensed between
RFIDtagsandreceiverisaffectedwhenthecorrosiontakes
place (He et al., 2014 ;Zhang et al., 2016 ). However, even
though this technology can provide cost effective solutions
forcorrosiondetection,itcanonlybeusedforatmospheric
corrosion, not to evaluate the corrosion condition of the
structureitself.
•Radiography (RT) is a type of volumetric inspection
technique based on the effects of X-Ray passing through
the specimen and producing a radiograph. This technique
most commonly has been used for pipe inspection
(Zscherpel et al., 2006 ). X-ray generators producing the
beam (Hanke et al., 2008 ), display devices and collimators
to direct radiation beam to the place of inspection ( Jensen
andGray, 1992 )arethedevicesthatareoccupiedduringthe
inspectionprocess.
•Visual Inspection Visual inspection is a common and
widely used corrosion inspection method in many
applications. Assessment of corrosion condition of the
structure is done by visual appearance and this can be
executed without any complex tools and equipment when
there is physical access to the object. This method has
been enhanced using cameras to capture the structure
with images or video during the inspection followed by
various advanced image processing techniques enhancing
thefeatureclassificationandsegmentationprocessforbetter
efficiency. However, visual inspection is challenging and
ineffective when it is difficult to access the target structure.
As well, not appropriate when a quantitative assessment of
corrosionisrequired.
Additionally, integrating corrosion detection sensors/
methodologies to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or
remotelypilotedaircrafthavebecomeaverypromisingapproach
for providing remote access during structural health inspection
activities. This is important because integrating UAVs with an
inspection system of NDT sensors can facilitate to perform
measurements in different locations of the structure using the

same sensor. Mainly, UAVs have been used in visual inspection
methods with embedded high resolution cameras allowing
remotevisualinspectionofthestructures Shafiee et al. (2021) .
Tosummarize,corrosiondetectionsensorsandtechnologies
are available based on different sensing principles evaluating
different physical variables. Each of these technologies has its
own advantages and technical limitations making their use
beneficialorlimitedincertainapplications.
3.2 Corrosion monitoring based on
non-destructive testing
The degree of complexity of a corrosion monitoring system
is illustrated in Figure 2based on the technical capacity of each
corrosionsensor/detectionmethod,anddifferentlevelsofsystem
implementations. When the level of implementation increases,
thecapabilitiesofthecorrosionmonitoringsystemalsoincrease.
NDT methods are more appropriate for corrosion
monitoring systems, as they are expected to operate with
minimum human interventions for long time in the field.
Among the methods discussed in Section 3.1 , all the magnetic
techniques, acoustic techniques, thermography, and RFID are
considered as non-destructive and non-intrusive techniques
(Forsyth, 2011 ;Khan et al., 2020 ;Márquez and Chacón, 2020 ).
Ontheotherhand,electrochemicaltechniques(e.g.,OPC,LPR,
and EN) provide direct measurements of the corrosion process
andcanbeusedtodeterminereal-timecorrosionrates.However,
electrochemicaltechniquesareconsideredtobeintrusive,which
can alter the corrosion process itself. And sensor has to be in
direct contact with the corroded area making them not very
attractive if one plans to cover large areas for monitoring. In
the case of RFID technique, the precision that can be obtained
based on the degradation of the RFID signal is very poor. As
in the case of electrochemical techniques, the RFID technique
is not measuring the structure itself. In applications such as
concrete structures, the RFID tag must be embedded in the
targetstructuremakingthesystemmorecomplicatedduringthe
installationandimpossibletorepairafterdeployment.
The chosen corrosion monitoring technique shall be non
destructive,non-intrusive,andabletoproducecorrosionrelated
quantitative measures. In addition, the application to be used,
type of corrosion intend to detect, relevant environmental
conditions, cost, properties of the material to be tested, coating
types, and frequency of testing to be performed also have to be
considered.
3.2.1 Corrosion monitoring systems and
designs
Aspresentedin Figure 2,thecorrosionmonitoringsolutions
can be in different testing levels. This is because, some are
focusedonmethodologiestooptimizethesensorcharacteristicsand its performance but they are not ready as a complete
deployed system. And some works present final solutions yet
they are under or have not been in validation phase in relevant
environments. In each of these cases, the works found in the
literature with possible corrosion monitoring solutions/designs
arediscussedbelow.
InZhang et al. (2017) ,amagnetic-basedcorrosiondetection
system has been developed to investigate the relation between
corrosion rate and magnetic induction in steel reinforcement.
In the system, a magnetic field is created using series-wound
permanentmagnetsandthechangesthathappeninthemagnetic
induction due to substantial permeability difference between
rust and steel is detected with a hall effect sensor. The results
show that the mass loss in reinforced steel due to corrosion and
the voltage increment of the hall effect sensor are linear and
therefore it is concluded that the proposed magnetic corrosion
device is capable of quantitative analysis of corrosion rate. In
Wasif et al. (2022) ,authorsproposemagneticeddycurrentbased
sensor for corrosion monitoring of pipelines. The sensor design
optimization, sensitivity and power consumption have been
studied. Moreover, the sensor was tested using as accelerated
corrosiontestonmildsteel.
InJiang et al. (2017) , a stress wave based active sensing
corrosion monitoring approach is presented using embedded
piezo ceramic transducers for prestressed concrete structures.
The proposed system would give corrosion information about
two stages such as free expansion of the corrosion products
andcorrosioninducedcracksoccurrencequantifyingtheenergy
of the received signal based on Wavelet packet-based energy
analysis.Theproposedsensordimensionsare(25 mm ×25 mm
×25 mm) and it has been tested on two concrete beams
(prestress and without prestress) under accelerated corrosion
environment.
Although the solutions based on electrochemical sensors
seemnottobethemostsuitableonesforcorrosionmonitoring,
some approaches have been found in the literature. In
Pei et al. (2021) authors propose galvanic cell type sensors
able to achieve a quantitative corrosion evaluation when
atmospheric corrosion occurs. However, these sensors are
measuringthecorrosivityoftheatmosphereanditcanonlyrelate
to the corrosion condition of a structure exposed in the same
environment, but not evaluating the structure itself directly. In
Figueira (2017) ,itisconcludedthatifelectrochemicalsensorsare
correctly employed for the corrosion monitoring of reinforced
concrete, fast, reliable, and quantitative corrosion information
can be obtained. In Leon-Salas and Halmen (2015) authors
rely on electrochemical techniques as well. In this case, they
proposed linear polarization and open circuit potential for the
proposed corrosion monitoring system in reinforced concrete.
The authors use RFID communications to send the data to a

testing of the proposed sensor in a real environment must be
doneinthefuture.
Project iWindCr ( Ahuir-Torres et al., 2019 ) is an effort to
find benchmarking parameters that can show early signs of
corrosion in offshore. This approach is based on several
types of electrochemical sensors providing data about the
advancement of corrosion in specific locations of the wind
turbine.Althoughthedataobtainedaremainlybasedonapilot

given, the iWindCr system shows an interesting and relevant
methodologicalapproachtotheproblemofremotelymonitoring

Inviewofanybreakdownintheappliedcoatingwillleadto
the onset of corrosion, visual detection of such situations can
be identified as critical corrosion points in a structure. These
systemscanserveaswarningsystemstodetectthelocationswith
possible risks, and could use with other complementary NDT
methods to evaluate the structure condition quantitatively if
needed.Suchsystemhasbeenproposedin Momber et al. (2022)
as a condition monitoring approach based on automaticimage acquisition and image processing for monitoring and
maintenance planning of surface protection systems in onshore
windturbines.
Several interesting works have been presented related to
integrating/thermal/IR cameras, sensors, and other required
electronics circuitry with UAVs for corrosion detection. In
particular, Liu et al. (2018) proposes a micro aerial vehicle
(MAV) facilitated coating assessment system based on infrared
active thermography with artificial intelligence (AI). However,
the system work as an inspection system operated semi-
autonomously. Working towards autonomous inspection,
Andersen et al. (2020) investigate several deep learning
architectures to find out the best suited for an autonomous
inspection system. These architectures were investigated for
marine corrosion classification where the inspection activities
are proposed to perform by an UAV. However, the performance
of the algorithms has not been evaluated in real-time and the
results do not provide enough information about the location
wherecorrosionispresentandanyquantitativemeasurementof
corrosion.
A low power, low cost corrosion monitoring system based
on ultrasound time of flight technology is implemented for
OWTs(Thibbotuwa et al., 2022 ).Theproposedsystemmeasures

zones) and has the advantage of operating from clean side of
the wind turbine, making it more appropriate for operation in
marineenvironment.Thesystemsuccessfullyprovidesthickness
measurements in both bare steel and coated samples, and
the precision of these measurements (around 1  μm) allows to
achieve an intra-day estimation of the corrosion rate in real-
time.
3.3 Corrosion monitoring in offshore
wind turbine
Our definition for corrosion monitoring system is a
reliable system which operates successfully unattended and is
able to produce quantitative corrosion measures. In general,
implementing a corrosion monitoring system with these
requirementsischallengingforanyapplicationfield.
Based on the literature, we could not find any
commercialized or automated system beyond the testing phase
(in development stage) which is currently applied in real-time
for corrosion monitoring in offshore wind farms in the way we
definedabove.
Considering the performance expectations of a corrosion

3.4 Challenges in corrosion monitoring
in offshore
Researchanddevelopmentofcorrosionmonitoringsystems
inoffshorehavetoencounteranumberofchallenges.
Almosteverystructureinanykindofapplicationiscorrosion
protected by various types of coating layers. Early marine
corrosion under coating is difficult to detect and determine
the size of the defect with visual testing methods and it could
bealsochallengingforotherNDTtechniquesaswelldepending
on type and thickness of the protective coating applied. From
the corrosion detection and monitoring perspective, each layer
of coating introduces a challenge. Another major challenge
is obtaining accurate and reliable quantitative measurements
of corrosion for long term ( Martinez-Luengo et al., 2016 ). As
discussed in Subsection 3.1.1 andTable 2, each corrosion
detection technique has operational limitations. In particular,
temperaturemayinfluencesensorreadingsandaccuracyofmost
ofthecorrosionmonitoringmethods( Rommetveit et al., 2010 ).
Therefore, corrosion measurements may need calibration
based on temperature to obtain a better corrosion
estimate.
Moreover, working on corrosion monitoring systems to

4Corrosion prognostics
Intheprevioussectionweconsideredcorrosionmonitoring
to determine the current state of corrosion. For scheduling
maintenance or decommissioning, it is important to estimate
the future corrosive state and in particular the Remaining
Useful Life (RUL) of the Offshore Wind Turbine (OWT)
structure. A (lifetime) prognosis method for a system estimatesits RUL, or, more generally, the future trajectory of states of
a system over time from the current state to its End Of Life
(EOL). We can distinguish three types of prognosis methods:
data-driven, model-based, and hybrid methods ( An et al., 2015 ;
Vachtsevanos, 2020 ),andbelowwegiveabriefoverviewofthese
typesofprognosismethods.Thetypesofprognosismethodsthat
are most appropriate for a given problem are highly dependent
on the type and the amount of data available and on the
existence of accurate degradation models. We also discuss the
applicabilityofthevariousprognosismethodtypesforcorrosion
prognosis in OWT structures. For other failure modes of wind
turbinestructureswereferto Jardine et al. (2006) forareviewon
diagnosisandprognosisofmechanicalsystems.
4.1 Data-driven prognosis methods
A prognosis method is called data-driven if it uses only
measurement data of the system under consideration and
historical measurement data (measurement data with the
corresponding RUL) of other similar systems. In particular,
no model of the physical state of the system is used.
Various data-driven prognosis methods exist, of which neural
networks and Gaussian process regression are most often used
(An et al., 2015 ).
4.1.1 Neural networks
An artificial neural network (simply called neural network)

Aggarwal, 2018 ).
Neural networks have been used for corrosion prediction
in various ways. For example, they have been used to predict
corrosionpolarizationcurvesandcorrosionratesbasedonboth
impedance measurements and historical data, respectively, see
Kamrunnahar and Urquidi-Macdonald (2010) . Also, corrosion
rates have been predicted using neural networks based on
meteorological data as input ( Kenny et al., 2009 ). Moreover,
corrosion depth has been estimated by neural networks using
a database of published corrosion measurements as input
(Cai et al., 1999 ). Neural networks have also been trained to
estimate the pitting potential of stainless steel as a function
of temperature and concentrations of salt, sulphate, carbonate,
nitrate,andhydroxide( Cottis et al., 1999 ).
4.1.2 Gaussian process regression
Gaussian process regression is another data-driven method
that can be used for prognosis. Recall that a Gaussian stochastic
processis a natural generalization of the notion multivariate
normal distribution to function spaces on a possibly infinite
domain T. Now, Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a
method to determine an optimal Gaussian stochastic process
given a dataset and a covariance matrix kt,t′fort,t′∈Tthat
representsthesimilaritybetweenelementsof T(Rasmussenand
Williams, 2006 ). For example, if Tis a time domain, then the
closer the points tandt′are in time (i.e., the smaller | t−t′|),
the larger their covariance. The output of Gaussian process
regression is a Gaussian stochastic process for which functions
f:T→Dthataremorelikelytorepresentthegroundtruth,obtain
a higher probability. In this way, a Gaussian stochastic process
does not only give the most likely value for every t∈T(i.e., the
meanoftherandomvariable X(t)),butalsoitsvariance.
There are various papers in the literature that use GPR to
estimate corrosion growth. GPR can be used to filter noisy
measurementsortofilterotheroutsideinfluences.Forexample,
GPR is used in Woo et al. (2020) to remove temperature effects
on the estimation of corrosion potential. Also, GPR is used to
predictaspatialmapofwallthicknessesbasedonmeasurements
ofanumberofspatiallocations( Shi L. et al., 2015 ).
While applying GPR on corrosion process parameters for
the sample under consideration is suitable for interpolation
of the ground truth, this is less suitable for prognosis (i.e.,
extrapolation)astheuncertaintyincreasestooquicklyformany
real-world applications. Therefore, in order to obtain reliable
long term extrapolation, GPR needs to be applied to both the
measurementsofthecurrentsampleandhistoricalmeasurement
data of similar samples. Alternatively, GPR can be augmented
with a physics-based degradation model (see Section 4.2 ) to
obtain a hybrid solution, where GPR is used to estimate the
parameters of the degradation model (for example, to estimate
thecorrosionrate( Liu et al., 2017 )).A natural generalization of Gaussian process regression is
to consider stochastic process regression where the random
variables X(t)satisfy possibly non-Gaussian probability
distributions. Indeed, since corrosion depth cannot be negative
it is natural to consider probability distributions for which
negative values have probability zero. For example, the inverse
Gaussian probability distribution satisfies this property while
beingsimilartoanormaldistributionfornon-negativevalues.In
Zhang et al. (2013) inverseGaussianprocessregressionisusedto
estimatethewallthicknesslossduetocorrosionofunderground
energy pipelines. The parameters of this model were estimated
byusingmeasurementdatafrominspections.
Fora(purely)data-drivenprognosismethodtobeaccurate,
alargeamountofboth1)measurementsofthecurrentcorrosion
sample and 2) historical measurement data of similar samples
are needed. Therefore, the measurement data is typically sensor
data that is acquired in an automated way. Moreover, the
historical measurement data should be representative for the
current measurements to give accurate estimates. Indeed, if the
currentmeasurementcampaignisverydifferentfromanyofthe
historical measurement campaigns, then the RUL estimate that
isinferredbytheprognosismethodislikelytooinaccurate.
Currently, there is very little historical corrosion
measurement data available of walls of OWTs. Moreover, only
very few OWTs have reached their EOL, so there is virtually no
measurement data available of OWTs that are near their EOL.
Consequently,giventheaboveconstraintsontheapplicabilityof
data-driven prognostics, data-driven methods are currently not
applicableforestimatingtheRULofOWTs.
4.2 Model-based prognosis methods
Aprognosismethodiscalled model-based ifthemethoduses
an explicit model of the state of the system. The model may
be based on first principles or based on empirical evidence. In
case the model describes the degradation process of an asset,
the model is called a degradation model. An example of a
degradationmodelisacorrosionmodel.Wemaydistinguishtwo
typesofmodel-basedprognosismethods.
Afirst-principle prognosis method is a model-based
prognosis method where the model of the state of the system
is based on established laws of physics and empirical prognosis
methods. An example of a first-principle prognosis method is
the Paris’ law ( Paris et al., 1961 ), which is a degradation model
describingthegrowthofacrackinamaterialduetofatigue.
Anempirical prognosis method is a model-based prognosis
method where the model of the state of the system over time
is based on observed trends in historical measurement data.
By historical measurement data we mean here measurement
data that was acquired from systems other than the system
under consideration (i.e., from the system of which you

Brijder et al. 10.3389/fenrg.2022.991343
would like to predict the RUL). We refer to Section 4.3 for
prognosis methods that also use measurement data of the
system under consideration. While the empirically obtained
modelgivesageneraltrend,ittypicallyhasempiricalconstants.
Regression methods like least squares are able to estimate
unknown empirical constants based on historical measurement
data of systems close to the system under consideration
(An et al., 2015 ;Vachtsevanos, 2020 ). InGalea et al. (2009) ,
corrosion prognostics for aircraft is considered where model
fittingishistoricaldataisfollowedbymodelextrapolation.
Model-based prognosis methods are accurate if the model,
includingthevaluesoftheempiricalconstants,accuratelyreflects
reality. This implies that the physical degradation process is
highly deterministic. Indeed, the (deterministic) degradation
model cannot accurately reflect reality if there are several
significantly different degradation trajectories possible. Even if
the physical degradation process is highly deterministic and
there is a well understood degradation model in place, it might
be difficult to estimate the empirical constants of the model,
in particular when there is little historical data available from
systemssimilartotheoneunderconsideration.
In the case of prognosis of wall thickness reduction due
to corrosion in OWT structures, the physical degradation
process is rather non-deterministic. Indeed, unexpected weak
spots (that are not accounted for in the model) or accidental
scratches in the coating surface can lead to a much earlier than
expectedonsetofcorrosionofthesteel.Also,non-deterministic
environmental influences, like weather and waves, are able to
influence the corrosion process significantly. Finally, due to the
lackofhistoricalmeasurementdata,theempiricalconstantscan
beonlyroughlyestimated.
4.3 Hybrid prognosis methods
Anhybridprognosis method is a model-based prognosis
method where measurement data of the system under
consideration is used to improve the estimation of the current
state of the system. The degradation model is then used to
extrapolate future states based on the estimation of the current
state.Consequently,abetterestimationofthecurrentstateresults
inimprovedprognosisaccuracy.
Essentially,ahybridprognosismethodprovidesasolutionto
theBayesianfilteringproblem,whichwediscussin Section 5.1 ,
by estimating the most likely current state given the current
measurement and the prediction of the model given previous
measurements.See Figure 3foranillustrationofthisapproach.
If certain empirical constants of the model are not precisely
known, then a hybrid prognosis method is able to use the
incoming measurement data to provide a better estimate of
these constants. In this way, regression methods like least
squares (mentioned in Section 4.2 ) that estimate unknown
empiricalconstantscanbeusedinhybridprognosismethodsto

problem of corrosion prognosis using ultrasound.
provideinitialestimatesoftheseconstants,thataresubsequently
iteratively refined by filtering methods based on incoming
measurements.
An example of such a hybrid prognosis method applied for
corrosion prognostics is given in Chookah et al. (2011) . There,
historical data is used to accurately estimate the two constants
of an empirical model for corrosion-fatigue crack growth, and
incoming measurement data is used to continuously improve
this estimate through an approach similar to particle filtering
(particlefilteringisdiscussedin Section 5.3 ).
Using a hybrid prognosis method, a degradation model
can adapt to incoming measurement data and “choose” the
appropriate trajectory ofa degradationmodeltodeal with non-
deterministicbehaviour.Moreover,itcandealwithinitialrough
estimates of empirical constants by iteratively adapting these
constantstoincomingmeasurementdata.
4.4 Applicability of prognosis methods in
offshore wind turbine structures
RegardingcorrosionprognosisinOWTstructures:
•Data-driven methods are currently not applicable for
estimating the RUL of OWT structures due to the lack of
sufficientamountsofhistoricalcorrosionmeasurementdata
(speciallyfromOWTthathavealreadyreachedtheirEOL).
•Model-based methods require model parameters that
accurately reflect reality, which in the case of corrosion is
difficultduetoitsrathernon-deterministicnature.Besides,
in OWT structures, the estimation of such parameters is
difficultduetothelackofhistoricalcorrosionmeasurement
data.
Frontiers in Energy Research 15 frontiersin.org
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Brijder et al. 10.3389/fenrg.2022.991343
•In Hybrid methods, the degradation model can adapt to
incoming measurement data, allowing to deal with the
non-deterministicnatureofcorrosion.Besides,theiterative
adaptation of model parameters allows for initial rough
estimates which may be obtained with a limited amount of
historicalcorrosionmeasurements.
Due to the above-described limitations of the data-driven
andmodel-basedapproaches,themostsuitabletypeofprognosis
method for corrosion prognosis in OWTs seems to be hybrid
prognosis methods. Consequently, an approach to corrosion
prognosis using this type of method will be detailed in the
remainderofthepaper.
5Prognosis method for corrosion of
offshore wind turbines
Based on the types of prognosis methods discussed in
Section 4 , we detail below an approach for hybrid prognosis
methods for corrosion of Offshore Wind Turbines (OWTs). For
relatingcorrosiondiagnosticsandcorrosionprognosisestimates
to decision making and maintenance strategies, we refer to
Huynh et al. (2017) .
5.1 The Bayesian filtering problem
TheBayesian filtering problem is the problem of finding a
good estimate of the current state xtof a system given 1) noisy
measurement values zt’at various points in time t′≤t, 2) a
generalmodel Fofthesystem,calledthe state transition function ,
that assigns, given a state x, the state that follows x, and 3) a
model H, called the measurement function , that assigns to each
possible system state xa corresponding measurement value z.
Thestateofasystemencodesthevaluesofthegeneralmodelthat
areunknown.
Methods for the Bayesian filtering problem consist of two
steps, a prediction step and an update step, that occur for each
time step. In the prediction step, the estimation of the previous
statext−1together with the model Fof the system is used to
predict the current state, denoted by x′
t. In the update step, this

So,forsmalltimestepsizes d,wemaydefinethe Fasthefunctionsending a state (K,n,t)to the next state (K,n,t+d). Assuming
direct measurement of the wall thickness, the measurement
function Hsends(K,n,t)toW0−M=W0−Ktn,where W0isthe

Often,amodel y(t)isnotexplicitlydescribed,butdescribed

(or sequence of constants) c. For small steps d, the value
y(t+d)isapproximatedby y(t)+f(t,y,c)⋅d,thefirst-orderTaylor
expansion of yatt. So, for small d, we may define the state
transition function as the function sending a state (t,y,c)to the
next state (t+d,y+f(t,y,c)⋅d,c). In the case where fdoes not
dependon t,astatecanbeconciselydefinedas (y,c)andthestate
transitionfunctionsendsthisstateto (y+f(t,y,c)⋅d,c).
There are several techniques to solve the Bayesian filtering
problem for particular special cases. Depending on the system
model Fand measurement model Hused, the most appropriate
techniques to solve the Bayesian filtering problem for a slow
processes like corrosion are Kalman filtering, extended Kalman
filtering,unscentedKalmanfiltering,andparticlefiltering.
5.2 Kalman, extended kalman, and
unscented kalman filtering
In the case of Kalman filtering ( Kalman, 1960 ) and related
filtering methods like extended Kalman filtering and unscented
Kalman filtering ( Wan and Van Der Merwe, 2000 ), the above-
mentionedinformationdescribingtheconfidenceinthe a-priori
predicted state compared to the measurement is represented by
an estimate covariance matrix Pt−1for each time step. An a-
prioriprediction of the estimate covariance matrix P′
tis used to
compute xtfromx′
tandzt.
Kalman filtering assumes that both FandHare linear
transformations and is designed to handle two sources of noise:
Gaussian process noise wtand Gaussian measurement noise vt.
The system model Fis assumed to be perfect up to process
noise,whilethemeasurementmodel Hisassumedtobeperfect
up to measurement noise. If, moreover, the covariances of the
processandmeasurementnoisesaregiven,thenKalmanfiltering
isknowntoprovidetheoptimalstateestimate.
Recallthatin Section 5.1 ,wedefined FandHcorresponding
to the corrosion model of Eq. 2. We observe that while Fis a
lineartransformation, H(K,n,t)=W0−KtnisnotandsoKalman
filteringcannotbeapplied.OnewaytoperformBayesianfiltering
for this corrosion model is to consider an extension of Kalman
filtering. In the special case where we know that n=1,H isa

this case, the system state can be defined as (K,W), where Wis

the (estimated) wall thickness. If we denote the wall thickness
at time step tbyWt, then according to the corrosion model, we
haveWt+1=Wt−Kd,where disthetimestepsize.Hence Fsends
(K,W)to(K,W−Kd)andHsimplysends (K,W)toW.
ExtendedandunscentedKalmanfilteringarebothadaptions
ofKalmanfilteringdesignedtohandlethecasewhere ForH(or
both)arenotnecessarilylinear(asisthecasein Section 5.1 ).In
the case of extended Kalman filtering, because Kalman filtering
cannotbeappliedof FandHdirectly,Kalmanfilteringisapplied
on a linear approximation of Fand a linear approximation of
Hat state xt−1. These linear approximations are represented by
matrices containing the first-order partial derivatives (i.e., the
Jacobians)ofFandH.
In the case of unscented Kalman filtering, the (possibly
nonlinear) behavior near the previous state xt−1is estimated by
evaluating a small number of possible states around xt−1, called
sigma points .Thepredictandupdatesstepstakeintoaccountthe
behaviorofthesigmapointstofindappropriateestimates xtand
Pt.Variousalgorithmsexistforselectingsigmapoints.
Extended and unscented Kalman filtering do not guarantee
optimal solutions. Indeed, it is known to not perform well in
settingswhere ForHareverynonlinear,orinsettingswherethe
process noise or measurement noise are very non-Gaussian. An
advantage of extended Kalman filtering compared to unscented
Kalman filtering that the former is computationally more
efficient to compute. Conversely, unscented Kalman filtering
can be applied in cases where the Jacobians of FandH
are difficult (or impossible) to deduce. Moreover, unscented
Kalman filtering is known to be more accurate compared to
extendedKalmanfiltering.Sincecorrosionisaslowprocess,the
computational efficiency is likely less important for corrosion
prognosis compared to the advantages unscented Kalman
filtering provides. For a more extensive treatise we refer to the
literature,see,e.g., ChuiandChen (2017) .
5.3 Particle filtering
Particle filtering ( Del Moral, 1996 ) is a Bayesian filtering
method able to work with (very) nonlinear models Fand
(very) non-Gaussian noise sources, at the cost of being much
morecomputationallyintensivecomparedtounscentedKalman
filtering.In Li et al. (2017) particlefilteringisusedforcorrosion
diagnosisandprognosis.Inparticlefiltering,acollection Xt−1of
possible states xi,t−1, called particles, is kept along with weights
wi,t−1representingtherelativelikelihoodofstate xi,t−1compared
to the other particles. The estimation of the previous state xt−1
is then defined as the weighted average ∑n
i=1wi,t−1⋅xi,t−1of the
particlesof Xt−1.
Inthepredictstep,foreachparticle xi,t−1thecorresponding
a-prioriestimate x′
i,tis computed. Next, process noise chosen
from some (joint) probability distribution (not necessarily
Gaussian)isaddedto x′
i,ttoobtain xi,t.Intheupdatestep,thedifferencebetweentheprediction xi,t
of each particle and the new measurement ztis used to update
theweighttoobtain wi,t.Theestimationofthecurrentstate xtis
againtheweightedaverageoftheparticles xi,t.
Toavoidmanyparticleswithlowweight(i.e.,manyparticles
that are unlikely to represent the true state of the system),
resampling methodshavebeendeveloped( Li et al., 2015 ),where
the low-probability particles are discarded in favour of multiple
copiesofparticleswithhighweight(identicalparticleswillhave
different trajectories during the remaining run of the particle
filteringalgorithmduetotheaddedrandomprocessnoise).
Particle filtering requires that at least some particles among
the initial set of particles are near the true initial state of
the system. To have a high probability that some particles are
indeed near the true state, one should have many particles or a
reasonableestimateoftheinitialstate(orboth).
To give an example, in case we know that the process noise
using the corrosion model of Eq. 2is (very) non-Gaussian or
if we know that the measurement noise of some corrosion
measuring device is (very) non-Gaussian, then particle filtering
isanappropriateBayesianfilteringmethod.Asanotherexample,
thebi-modalmodelrecalledin Section 2.2 iscomplex,consisting
of two modes and together consisting of four quite different
phases. Therefore in case the accuracy of unscented Kalman
filteringisunsatisfactory(e.g.,duetothesignificantlynonlinear
behavior near the time where a phase-transition occurs), one
might turn to particle filtering. In this case, speed is traded for
accuracy assuming a sufficiently large amount of particles are
used.
5.4 Bayesian filtering applied to
corrosion prognosis in offshore wind
turbine structures
As mentioned in Section 2.2 , corrosion is best described by
non-linearempiricalmodelssuchasthe power-law andbi-modal
models. For a hybrid prognosis method intended for corrosion
inOWTstructures,wediscussedinthissectiontheapplicability

ExtendedKalmanfilteringiscomputationallymoreefficient
compared to Unscented Kalman filtering, though, this last
one is known to be more accurate and does not require the
computation of the Jacobians. Besides, the slow nature of
corrosion makes computational efficiency a less important
requirement.

better the case of (very) non-Gaussian process and
measuring noise. The computational efficiency of this
method may be overlooked given the slow nature of
corrosion.
6Conclusion
In this paper we reviewed various possible techniques for
corrosionmonitoringandprognosticsofOffshoreWindTurbine
(OWT) structures and, based on an analysis of the various
failure modes and monitoring systems, we described feasible
approachesinmoredetail.
Inparticular,wehavelookedatthevarioustypesofcorrosion
mechanisms taking place in OWT structures, and we have seen
that uniform corrosion is one of the dominating corrosion
mechanisms. We have considered various empirical models for
uniform corrosion and observed that the bi-modal model is
specifically suitable for the operating environments typical for
OWTstructures(see Section 2.3 ).
Next, we have evaluated ways of monitoring uniform
corrosionanddeterminedthatnon-destructiveandautonomous
monitoringsystemsbasedonultrasoundmeasurementsprovide
high accuracy at a relatively low cost, while being suitable for
deploymentinthechallengingenvironmentsunderwhichOWTs
operate(see Section 3.3 ).
Several general paradigms exist to perform prognostics of
a system. In the case of OWT structures, a hybrid prognosis
method, combining a corrosion degradation model with online
measurement data, likely provides a higher accuracy than
methods based on only a degradation model (model-based
prognosis methods) or only measurement data (data-driven
prognosis methods) (see Section 4.4 ). Finally, we have outlined
a hybrid prognosis method for corrosion prognosis in OWTs
structuresbasedonBayesianFiltering,andcurrentandhistorical
measurementsofwallthickness(see Section 5.4 ).Author contributions
