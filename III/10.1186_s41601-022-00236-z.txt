Abstract 
The keys factor in making wind power one of the main power sources to meet the world’s growing energy demands 
is the reliability improvement of wind turbines (WTs). However, the eventuality of fault occurrence on WT com-
ponents cannot be avoided, especially for doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) based WTs, which are operating 
in severe environments. The maintenance need increases due to unexpected faults, which in turn leads to higher 
operating cost and poor reliability. Extensive investigation into DFIG internal fault detection techniques has been 
carried out in the last decade. This paper presents a detailed review of these techniques. It discusses the methods that 
can be used to detect internal electrical faults in a DFIG stator, rotor, or both. A novel sorting technique is presented 
which takes into consideration different parameters such as fault location, detection technique, and DFIG modelling. 
The main mathematical representation used to detect these faults is presented to allow an easier and faster under -
standing of each method. In addition, a comparison is carried out in every section to illustrate the main differences, 
advantages, and disadvantages of every method and/or model. Some real monitoring systems available in the market 
are presented. Finally, recommendations for the challenges, future work, and main gaps in the field of internal faults 
in a DFIG are presented. This review is organized in a tutorial manner, to be an effective guide for future research for 
enhancing the reliability of DFIG-based WTs.

Wind power generation has experienced rapid expan -
sion because of its environmental and economic benefits. 
It is predicted that wind power installations could reach 
2110 GW by 2030 [1]. Doubly-fed induction generator 
(DFIG)-based units are common among various wind 
turbine (WT) technologies because of their advantages 
of only using small converters (approximately one-third 
of the generator rating), leading to reduced cost com -
pared to other variable speed WTs while retaining the 
ability to separately control active and reactive power [2, 
3]. The standard configuration of such WTs consists of a 
wound rotor induction generator (WRIG) with its stator 
connected to the grid, while the rotor is connected to a back-to-back converter through slip-rings to operate as a 
DFIG, as shown in Fig. 1.
Recent surveys of wind power plants have reported 
several failures including internal generator (stator and 
rotor), electrical system, control system, drive train, sen -
sors, gear box, mechanical brake, hydraulics, yaw system, 
structure, hub and blades/pitch faults [4]. Generally, the 
main faults of electrical machines (DFIG) can broadly 
be classified as stator winding faults, broken rotor bar 
or cracked rotor end-rings, air-gap eccentricities, bend 
shaft, rotor winding short-circuits, and bearing and gear -
box failures [5].
The percentages of most common machine faults are 
shown in Fig.  2, i.e., bearing failure 40%, stator fault 38%, 
rotor fault 10% and all other faults 12% [6–10]. One or 
more of the symptoms may be associated with the inci -
dence of these faults, such as air gap imbalance, imbal -
ance in the induced voltages and line currents, increased Open AccessProtection and Control of

torque pulsation, increased losses, reduction in perfor -
mance, decrease in average torque, and excessive heating 
[5]. This work focuses on the internal faults (stator and 
rotor faults) of DFIG-based wind power generation units.
DFIGs usually operate in a harsh environment where 
they are subjected to extreme mechanical and electri -
cal stresses. These stresses can be explained by the fact 
that the stator circuit is connected to a grid subjected 
to voltage dips and fluctuations. In the rotor circuit, the 
use of a back-to-back converter increases the thermal 
and electrical stresses on the winding because of the fast 
switching effect of the converter and higher-order har -
monics. Internal electrical faults usually begin as insula -
tion degradation, and some windings can be considered 
to be short-circuited and act like a separate coil inside 
the machine winding with a very high current pass -
ing through (hot spot). The stator and rotor circuits are 
not yet open-circuited and the machine may continue 
to work with this undetected internal fault as shown in 
Fig.  3. Thus, it is very important to detect these faults 
at an early stage before they turn into complete ground 
faults or phase-to-ground faults which in turn may cause 
catastrophic destruction or human injury.
In the current rotating equipment condition monitor -
ing schemes, some symptoms in electrical machines are 
used for fault detection. These faults can be categorized 
as mechanical symptoms, e.g., vibration and speed fluctu -
ation, and electrical symptoms, e.g., induced voltages and 
currents, leakage fluxes, and partial discharges [5]. Sev -
eral types of sensors are used to measure these symptoms and are important parts of the detection systems. The 
detection of bearing faults and loose coils by monitoring 
the acoustic emissions is presented in [11, 12]. Vibration 
emissions have been used to detect mechanical faults 
[13], non-event air-gap [14], stator and rotor faults [15], 
asymmetrical power supply, and internal faults [16].
On the other hand, modern detection and monitor -
ing systems depend on the principle of signature analy -
sis of the machine’s phase, line, and circulating currents. 
The work reported in [5, 17] shows that asynchronous 
machine internal faults can be detected by current or 
power analysis, and demonstrates that power signal 
analysis has higher accuracy than current signal analy -
sis [18]. The findings of this work encourage researchers 
to continue working on internal electrical fault detec -
tion in WRIGs based on the analysis of current or power 
signals [19–29]. These works vary from analyzing only 
experimental data, investigation based on simulation and 
experimental data [20–25], and theoretical explanation 
for the origins of fault-related components [22, 24, 26, 
29]. Practical experiments are done by inserting a resist -
ance or an inductance to machine windings to emulate 
an internal fault inside the machine [19, 23, 27, 28] or 
by actual short circuit or open circuit faults [24, 26, 29]. 
Variations in stator and rotor current spectral contents 
during an internal fault are presented in [19, 21–29], 
while theoretical explanations of these fault-related com -
ponents are presented in [22, 24, 26, 29]. The analyses in 
[19–26, 29] on the other hand, concentrate on construct -
ing a reliable fault index by analyzing both stator and 
rotor currents.
In this paper, findings of over 120 published papers 
on the detection of internal electrical faults in DFIG 
and developing successful engineering solutions, are 
reviewed. The paper starts with a general overview of 
the structure of DFIG for WT application. The focus will

then be directed to the various detection methods and 
DFIG condition monitoring techniques. A brief explana -
tion about each type of method applied for internal fault 
diagnosis of DFIG is presented, and a comparison is pro -
vided to illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of 
each method. Figure  4 represents the sorting techniques 
that are used which take into consideration location and 
detection methods. A different sorting technique is dis -
cussed in [30], one which relies on detection methods 
regardless of the location of the fault, while the technique 
in [31] pays more attention to different methodologies 
beyond modeling. Reference [32] represents a sorting 
technique which focuses on condition monitoring system 
philosophy.
The main contributions of this work can be summa -
rized as follows:
• A novel sorting technique is employed to distinguish 
the mathematical model used to set up the detection 
algorithm in each fault case. Also, it takes the loca -
tion of the fault and methodology of the detection 
technique into consideration. The proposed sort -
ing method helps new researchers to have a fast and 
deep comprehension of the topic, with the ability to 
move from one approach to another or from stator 
faults to rotor faults freely without any confusion.
• The study presents a detailed discussion on every 
detection technique with emphasis on the advantages 
and limitations of each method. The available prod -
ucts on the market that may be used for induction 
machine condition monitoring are highlighted while 
considering the advantages and limitations of each 
product.
• The study identifies the gaps that need to be filled in 
future research along with future trends.
The paper is organized as follows. Section  2 presents the 
stator internal fault detection methods, while Section  3 presents the rotor internal fault detection methods. In 
Section  4, methods that can be used to detect both stator 
and rotor internal faults are presented. Some of the real 
monitoring systems available in the market are presented 
in Section  5, and Section  6 summarizes challenges and 
future trends. Finally, Section 7 offers conclusions.
2  Stator fault detection methods
Generally, stator winding faults can be classified as turn-
to-turn shorts within a coil (inter-turn short circuit), 
shorts between coils of the same phase, phase-to-phase 
short, phase-to- ground short, and open circuit in one 
phase. The general opinion of users and manufactur -
ers is that there is a long lead-time between the incep -
tion of shorted turns and a complete failure. In modern 
production processes, any lead time can be extremely 
advantageous since unexpected failures of a drive can 
be very costly. If an inter-turn short (one or two shorted 
turns) can be diagnosed, a pre-planned shutdown can 
be arranged and the fault can be fixed at an early stage 
before it becomes a complete phase-to-phase fault or 
phase-to-ground fault.
In this section, a comprehensive review of stator inter -
nal faults is presented including their detection param -
eters/techniques, and of the latest trends in the condition 
monitoring technology. It is aimed at providing a broad 
perspective on the status of stator internal fault moni -
toring to researchers and application engineers who are 
involved with DFIG-based WTs.
2.1  Stator current spectrum analysis
The detection of stator internal faults in synchronous and 
asynchronous machines is discussed in [33–35] using the 
extended Park’s vector approach (EPVA). Stator internal 
faults have been shown to be effectively detected by trac -
ing some specific fault-related frequency components in 
the stator current at twice the fundamental frequency 
( 2f1 ). The amplitudes of these fault-related components 
have been found to be directly related to the fault degree. 
A severity factor has also been presented and proven 
to be a good indicator of the machine condition. The 
machine current Park’s vector components ( id , iq ) as a 
function of phase currents ( iA , iB , iC ) are represented as:

machine current signature analysis (MCSA) and EPVA, 
in addition to a transient technique including EPVA, 
the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and statistics. 
This technique has been found to be unaffected by wind 
speed fluctuations. The frequency components which 
may appear in the stator current spectrum as a result 
of an internal fault in the stator circuit are given as [37]:
 where fssc is the stator frequency, f1 is the funda -
mental frequency, p is the number of pole pairs, s is 
the slip, and n,k are integers where n=[1, 2, 3, ...], 
andk=[1, 3, 5, ...] . Reference [38] also adopts the same 
detection philosophy represented in [20], though in this 
case the detection system only employs MCSA with 
a continuous wavelet transform (CWT). In this case, 
Eq.  (3) is used to identify the fault-related components 
which may appear in the stator current spectrum as a 
result of an internal fault in the stator circuit.
A complete simulation model of DFIG based on 
multi-circuit theory is proposed in [23, 39]. The model 
shows that some frequency components which appear 
in the spectrum of the phase current can be used as an 
indicator for internal faults. The model also suggests 
that the fault position can be detected by checking the 
current phase angle difference. The mutual inductance 
( Mij) between two stator coils i  and j  under asymmet -
rical conditions that can be used to calculate the har -
monics contained in stator current is given as:
 where Nk is the number of turns in coil i, τ is the stator 
pole pitch, l is the stator effective length, µo is the abso -
lute permeability, σ is the air gap length, kyk is the pitch 
factor for a coil for the kth order harmonic wave, θij is the 
electrical angle between the two coils, and Z is an integer 
where Z=1

p.
An analytical model for DFIG is presented in [25] 
based on the coupled-circuit approach and the prin -
ciples of generalized harmonic analysis along with 
complex conductor distribution. The proposed model 
calculates the self and mutual inductances with a gen -
eral conductor distribution using a simplified harmonic 
summation. The calculation of the mutual inductance 
between two stator circuits and mutual inductance 
between stator and rotor circuits, which are helpful 
to identify and detect stator internal faults, is given as

sm are the vth har-
monic complex conductor distribution of the mth and nth 
in the stator circuits, respectively. These are determined 
by summing the contributions of all of the coils in that 
circuit. Msm ,rn and Mrn,sm are the mutual inductances 
between the stator and rotor circuits and vice versa, θ is 
the angular displacement of the rotor in mechanical radi -
ans, and kv
sk is the vth harmonic skew factor. Subscripts s 
and r indicate stator and rotor coils, respectively.
An enhanced DFIG model with stator fault is presented 
in [41] using constant matrices, and a detection algo -
rithm based on wavelet analysis for the stator current 
and energy is proposed. The fault severity factor (FSF) 
defined in the algorithm is given as [42]:
 where Em(f) is the measured wavelet signal energy at a 
certain detail level, and Eo(f) is the original signal energy.
The identification and location of stator internal 
faults at different slots are presented in [43]. The modi -
fied fault model is developed based on 2D discretization 
and piecewise interpolation, by taking the short-circuit 
number and position of the short-circuit slot as model 
parameters. Simulations show that the three-phase stator 
currents are no longer symmetrical when an inter-turn 
short circuit fault (ITSCF) occurs, where the faulty-
phase current is greater than the healthy ones. Moreo -
ver, ITSCF induces a negative sequence current that 
increases with the gravity of the fault in the DFIG stator. 
Commonality and heterogeneity existing in the current 
amplitude and negative sequence features are proposed 
and analyzed for detecting stator inter-turn faults at dif -
ferent slots of the DFIG. The Fourier expansion formula 
of the magnetomotive force ( F(α,t) ) of the single-turn 
coil concluded by strict derivation is written as [43]:(5) Lsm,sn=Lsn,sm=µoleﬀπd3

kyf is the coil pitch factor, αy is the space electrical angle 
between two conductors, and ϑ=1/p,2/p,3/p,... for 
short pitch coils, ϑ=1/p,2/p,3/p,...,ϑ�=2, 4, 6, ... for 
full pitch coil windings, and ω=2π f1 is the angular fre -
quency of the supply.
Based on the stationary reference frame, references [44, 
45] use the state-space model of DFIG in the detection 
of internal faults. The proposed diagnosis technique has 
the advantage of enabling fault detection, identifying the 
faulty phase and fault level. The open-loop feedback of 
the linear Kalman filter (LKF) is used in this technique, 
while the linear parameter varying (LPV) model is found 
useful during hardware implementation to minimize pro -
cessing time. By diagnosing the small and high levels of 
ITSCF, the proposed technique is effective and reliable 
for detecting internal stator faults. The proposed detec -
tion approach is achieved by analyzing stator current 
residual signals, which can be defined as the estimated 
errors between the currents given by the model and the 
currents estimated by the LKF, based on the fact that the 
established model of DFIG is an LPV model [46]. The 
mathematical formula used to calculate the residual sig -
nals ( �is,αβ and �ir,αβ ) are given as [47]:
 where /hatwideis,αβ and /hatwideir,αβ are the respective stator and rotor 
currents estimated by LKF, and is,αβ and ir,αβ are the 
respective stator and rotor currents estimated by the LPV 
model.
An analytical and experimental study for the detec -
tion of stator internal faults with a focus on their effects 
on DFIGs is presented in [48]. A variable resistance is 
inserted into the stator circuit to model an internal fault, 
and several values of resistance are used to model the dif -
ferent fault levels to analyze the effect of fault level on the 
detection system. The results are analyzed by the MCSA 
method to confirm the sensitivity of the proposed tech -
nique. They show that MCSA can be regarded as a reli -
able tool for preventive maintenance for internal faults at 
an early stage to prevent complete machine destruction. 
The specific fault-related harmonics that may appear in 
the stator current because of a stator internal fault can be 
calculated using (3).
2.2  Rotor current spectrum analysis
Further research has been conducted to detect stator 
faults in DFIGs using the principle of search-coil volt -
age [24, 49]. Results show that harmonics induced in 
the rotor circuit can be used as a reliable index to detect (10) �is,αβ=/hatwideis,αβ−is,αβ
(11)�ir,αβ=/hatwideir,αβ−ir,αβstator faults by tracing some specific components in the 
rotor circuit, such as phase current and rotor search-coil 
voltage. It is shown that the search-coil voltage can pro -
vide an accurate index for stator internal faults [50]. The 
following equations represent the orders of the harmonic 
components that may appear in the rotor circuit because 
of a stator fault:
where fssc and frsc are respectively the harmonic order 
induced in the stator current and rotor current due to 
internal stator short circuit fault, and n1 is an integer 
given as n1=1, 6m 1±1(m 1=1, 2, 3, ....).
Because discrimination between normal and abnor -
mal stator operating conditions cannot be achieved by 
traditional Fourier analysis as it consumes long time and 
requires large computational memory, a wavelet-based 
analysis of rotor currents is proposed in [51] to detect 
stator faults. This technique shows that the mean power 
signal can be used as a reliable diagnostic index to quan -
tify the fault level.
ITSCF and winding resistive asymmetrical faults are 
modeled in [52] using a complete magnetic equivalent 
circuit (MEC). The investigation aims to use the rotor 
reference voltage signals inside the back-to-back con -
verter to distinguish between these types of faults. DWT 
with normalized energy technique is applied to the given 
signals to define a fault diagnostic index (FDI). The 
accuracy of the proposed FDI is tested under different 
conditions such as low number of stator shorted turns, 
different severities of winding resistive asymmetrical 
faults, different levels of grid voltage imbalance, different 
rotor speeds, and different output active power. The nor -
malized energy coefficient ( ED
j_Norm ) used to calculate FDI 
can be mathematically represented as [53]:
 where j is the decomposition level and Nj is its data 
length given as Nj=N/(2j ) , with N being the length of 
the discrete signal. i is an integer i=1, 2, 3, .....Nj , and 
Dj is the DWT detail coefficient for the jth decomposi -
tion level. Eavg is the average energy reference which can 
be determined by measuring the average of ED
j using (15)

signals at three output active power levels (no load, 50% 
rated, and full load) delivered from DFIG under healthy 
winding conditions. Comparing the normalized energy of 
coefficient D5 or D6 leads to diagnosis of healthy condi -
tions from the other stator winding fault conditions. FDI 
can be mathematically expressed as:
 The results show that FDI is greater than 1 under ITSCF, 
and less than 1 under a winding resistive asymmetrical 
fault and grid voltage imbalance conditions.
Reference [54] investigates the detection of stator faults 
using rotor current spectrum analysis. A complete finite 
element model (FEM) is presented which shows that 
two harmonic components (2−s)f1 and (2+s)f1 in the 
rotor current increase with the occurrence of the sta -
tor fault. As the fault gets worse these two components 
show a rapid increase. Between the two frequencies, the 
increase of (2−s)f1 is more prominent, and thus it can be 
employed as an effective fault indicator owing to its high 
sensitivity.
Rotor spectrum analysis along with rotor power wave -
form is discussed in [55]. The main advantage of this 
technique is that external sensors and hardware devices 
are not required as the rotor power can be measured 
using the back-to-back converter’s built-in sensors. In 
addition, the fault can be detected using a characteris -
tic frequency of 2f1 which does not depend on the rotor 
speed, indicating high reliability even under rotor speed 
fluctuations. The simulation shows that during a stator 
internal fault, the rotor instantaneous power spectrum 
changes significantly while the rotor current and voltage 
spectrum change insignificantly.
Rotor speed is used in [56] to detect stator faults based 
on an observer fault detection technique. The asymp -
totic and exponential adaptive observers are investigated 
in this study which shows that the fraction of short-cir -
cuited windings can be well calculated by both observa -
tion techniques, while the exponential technique shows 
a better transient performance. The exponential adap -
tive observer is modified to detect the fault degree and 
rotor speed in case the rotor speed is inestimable but 
additional tuning may be required to improve the tran -
sient performance of speed estimation. The technique is 
tested on both steady-state and transient operations, and 
it is found that this observer-based strategy can provide 
accurate estimation of stator internal faults regardless of 
the operating condition of the generator.
2.3  Stator and rotor current spectrum analysis
Reference [57] introduces a monitoring and diagnostic 
technique for the detection of stator faults using DWT (16) FDI=ED
5,Norm /ED
6,Normunder time varying conditions in two main different con -
texts: transient-speed conditions and fault-varying con -
ditions. A frequency sliding (FS) approach with a high 
multi-resolution analysis is proposed to improve the abil -
ity of DWT in extracting the most relevant stator fault 
frequency component dynamically over time. Also, a 
dynamic mean power calculation at different resolution 
levels is introduced as a diagnostic index to quantify the 
fault extent.
Diagnosis of a stator winding fault for DFIG based on 
stator current negative-sequence component, using the 
phase angle difference between phase currents and rotor 
power spectrum, is proposed in [58, 59]. Because the 
rotating magnetic field in the positive rotation induces 
positive-sequence current and in the negative rotation 
induces negative-sequence current, when a short circuit 
fault occurs, the negative-sequence stator current will 
be generated. Consequently, the negative-sequence sta -
tor current can be regarded as a reliable index for stator 
internal faults in DFIG. Equation (8) is used to calculate 
the Fourier series analysis of the rotating magnetomotive 
force.
2.4  Transient leakage inductance
Based on the dq model of DFIG, another detection tech -
nique using the induced voltages of magnetizing induct -
ance and currents from both the stator and the rotor, is 
proposed in [60]. Results confirm that the proposed algo -
rithm can detect an internal fault in stator windings if the 
difference between the estimations of the two induced 
voltages exceeds a specific value. The results also show 
that the proposed algorithm issues the trip command 
instantaneously after the internal faults are detected. 
This is different to the case of transient states or external 
faults, where no trip command is issued. This technique 
has shown good reliability and accuracy under different 
fault and operating scenarios. The detectors of the d-axis 
( ∇d) and the q-axis ( ∇q) for fault detection are given as:
 where vr
d and vs
d are the RMS values of the induced volt -
ages from the rotor and stator sides in the direct axis, 
respectively. vr
q and vs
q are the RMS values of the induced 
voltages from the rotor and stator sides in the quadrature 
axis, respectively. Vd and Vq are the RMS values of vs
d and 
vs
q at steady state, respectively.
Reference [61] proposes an alternative method for 
detecting stator faults in DFIG by applying two short (17) ∇d=vr

voltage pulses with the same duration but in opposite 
directions to the stator windings. Analyzing the current 
responses during these pulses can be used to calculate 
the machine transient leakage inductance and detect sta -
tor faults, by considering:
 where iR,I−II is the induced rotor current, vR,I−II is the 
vector of the applied voltage, and ll is the leakage induct -
ance. The voltage difference phasor can be assumed con -
stant during each measurement period. This leads to the 
simplification of diR,I−II/dt≈yl and thus, observing only 
the current derivative difference phasor is sufficient for 
transient leakage inductance estimation. A fault sever -
ity factor is also developed to detect stator internal faults 
by using the back-to-back converter’s integrated sensors 
along with a signal processing procedure.
2.5  Vibration
Investigation for WRIG stator faults detection using 
vibration monitoring is presented in [62–64]. Results 
show that stator faults have a direct impact on the torque 
and vibration signals because each fault has a charac -
teristic frequency that appears in them. Thus, it can be 
regarded as a base for real-time condition monitoring for 
WRIG. Load influence on the fault-related components 
is examined and it shows that not all fault-related com -
ponents are induced equally in the spectrum for differ -
ent load levels, as some components suffer from a higher 
sensitivity to loading condition. The frequency compo -
nents that may appear in the torque spectrum under sta -
tor fault and unbalanced supply are presented as [62]:
 Reference [65] investigates the detection of stator faults 
using vibration signals under variable speed operation by 
monitoring energy changes in fault-specific frequency 
bands of interest. Using a time-stepped circuit model, 
the influence of stator electrical fault on machine opera -
tion is examined, and the simulation results show that 
fault-related harmonic components can be detected in 
the electromagnetic signal as a result of pulsating torques 
produced by stator asymmetric conditions. The fault-
specific components are then transformed into mechani -
cal vibration at the machine frame that can be employed 
for fault detection purposes using conventional vibration 
analysis. Numerical simulations are used to analyze the (19)diR,I−II

tions and different fault scenarios, whereas (20) and (21) 
are employed to detect fault-related components in the 
torque signal.
The use of a fiber Bragg grating accelerometer to detect 
stator faults by monitoring vibration signals is presented 
in [66]. This shows better accuracy than other vibration 
monitoring systems which depend on conventional pie -
zoelectric systems. However, fiber optic accelerometer 
frequency response may face difficulties in detecting the 
fault-related components under dynamic load condi -
tions. It is suggested that enhancing fiber optic-based 
detection system data processing and design will lead to 
full usage of fiber optic solutions. In addition, Eqs.  (20) 
and (21) are employed to detect fault-related components 
in the torque signal.
In [67], an alternative method for detecting stator faults 
using vibroacoustic emissions in WRIG is proposed. This 
provides a clearer understanding of WRIG acoustic emis -
sions. Results also confirm that acoustic emissions are 
directly related to vibrational emissions which increase 
due to stator internal faults. A study of acoustic sensor 
placement is also presented to determine the effect of 
acoustic emission sensing distance and location on the 
reliability of the detection system.
2.6  Magnetic flux
The application of a DC bus magnetic field to detect sta -
tor faults is suggested in [68] based on the fact that most 
of the power flow in or out of the machine passes through 
the DC bus. Thus the DC bus can be used to extract valu -
able information about machine health, and for real-time 
condition monitoring. Results show that analysis of the 
magnetic field signal measured at the DC link of the 
DFIG system can provide a reliable index for the occur -
rence of an internal fault in the machine. The system is 
tested under different load conditions and different fault 
levels. Other types of faults inside the DFIG, which have 
characteristic frequencies, are also detected by tracing 
those frequencies in the magnetic field signal. The main 
disadvantage of this technique is its dependency on 
magnetic flux sensors which in return need more wiring 
and instrumentation devices. However, a Hall sensor is 
employed in this case. This has low cost, simple wiring, 
and is suitable for the complex DC bus geometry. It also 
demonstrates that the proposed monitoring strategy may 
remove the need for a classical AC phase sensor while it 
may provide a good condition monitoring technique for 
the back-to-back converter itself. Equation  (16) is used 
to detect fault-related harmonics that may appear in the 
magnetic flux as a result of stator faults.
The usage of electromagnetic field analysis for the 
detection of stator internal faults is investigated in

[69, 70]. An FEM is used to model the machine under 
various stator internal faults based on harmonic com -
ponent analysis of the air-gap flux. The model takes 
into account the teeth/slots effect of stator and rotor, 
and the saturation of the core. The results show that 
the harmonic analysis of the magnetic flux is promis -
ing for the detection of stator faults. However, the main 
drawback of this method is that additional sensors are 
required for sensing the flux inside the machine. This 
increases the system complexity.Figure  5 illustrates a summary of different techniques 
that are used to detect stator faults in DFIGs, while 
Table  1 represents a comparison among these techniques.
3  Rotor faults detection methods
Rotor faults in a DFIG contribute up to 10% of electrical 
faults. This can be explained by the fact that power sys -
tems that WTs are connected to often experience many 
disturbances such as voltage dip and voltage imbalance, 
which result in thermal and electrical stresses in rotor Table 1 A comparison among different techniques used to detect DFIG stator faults

windings as well as mechanical stresses due to torque 
pulsation and vibration emission [71–73]. Also, the exist -
ence of the back-to-back converter in the rotor circuit 
increases the risk of rotor inter-turn short circuit faults, 
because of its switching action and harmonic emission. 
These elements have drawn the attention to the necessity 
of constructing a reliable condition monitoring system 
for the early detection of rotor faults in a DFIG. This can 
be summarized as follows.
3.1  Stator current spectrum analysis
MEC is used in [71] to drive a complete model of DFIG, 
which is used to investigate the impact of rotor internal 
faults in the stator current and control system. The work 
provides insight into the asymmetries between rotor 
internal faults and rotor with unbalanced resistance 
faults. It is found that the stator current is more appli -
cable than the control signals for the detection of rotor 
internal faults, in contrast to the rotor with unbalanced 
resistance fault. This system is tested under different 
wind speeds and load levels (active and reactive power). 
The frequency components that appear in the stator cur -
rent spectrum because of a rotor internal short circuit are 
presented as [74]:
 where frf
ind ,s is the induced frequency component in 
the stator current spectrum, k1 is an integer, given as 
k=0, 1, 2, ....
DFIG in a WT is considered as part of a sophisticated 
system with a closed-loop control system. Condition 
monitoring systems may not be a very attractive option in 
this situation, as the control system continuously adapts 
the system parameters to control both active and reac -
tive power and to maintain the machine in synchrony. 
Therefore, other signals should be investigated to acquire 
better indications to monitor machine conditions such 
as stator current which is used to detect rotor internal 
faults in [74–77]. In addition to stator current spectrum 
analysis, stator active power has also been investigated 
in [74] and it has shown more advantages, in respect of 
the amount of information that can be obtained from all 
phases, than the stator current spectrum. An analytical 
model is presented depending on (23) which represents 
the frequencies that can be induced in the WRIG stator 
because of rotor imbalance as a function of pole numbers 
[26].(22) frf

ind is the induced harmonics in the stator cur -
rent, j∗ is the order of the grid supply induced current 
harmonic components (j∗=1, 2, 3, ... ), and κ is an inte -
ger (κ=1, 2, 3, ...).
An algorithm for detecting broken rotor bars as well 
as shorted turns in induction machines is introduced in 
[78], based on spectrogram analysis using a fast Fourier 
transform (FFT). This method proves its ability to con -
sume a smaller amount of processing time which may be 
considered a great advantage. Similarly, Eq.  (23) is used 
to detect frequency components that might appear in 
the stator current spectrum because of the rotor internal 
short circuit.
The work in [79] demonstrates the use of an extended 
Kalman filter (EKF) to detect rotor internal faults. Perfor -
mance analysis uses EKF, CWT, and an iterative localized 
discrete Fourier transform to determine which system 
has better fault tracing sensitivity. When the machine is 
running at low slip, EKF has better sensitivity and accu -
racy, while EKF also has lower computational require -
ments compared to CWT. In [79], Eq.  (23) is used to 
detect fault-related components that may appear in the 
stator current spectrum due to rotor internal short cir -
cuits. Rotor faults are also investigated in [80] using an 
unscented Kalman filter (UKF) which has lower compu -
tational requirements than EKF because UKF does not 
have the obstacle of linearization error. The electromag -
netic torque is calculated during the procedure, and is 
not assumed to be constant or has a definite value which 
represents a great advantage for this model. The pro -
posed technique shows its ability to detect rotor faults 
when the system is connected to the grid or in isolated 
mode. As mentioned before, signal-based methods usu -
ally face a challenge in detecting machine faults during 
low slip operation, though this work shows high accuracy 
and sensitivity even near the synchronous speed.
Based on the time-synchronous averaging technique, 
an advanced maintenance strategy is introduced in [81, 
82]. The DWT analysis of the stator current residual sig -
nals is proven efficient in the detection of rotor internal 
faults, and consequently, it can be implemented with con -
dition monitor systems to construct a reliable detection 
system. To study rotor electrical and mechanical signals 
for fault measurement, a DFIG harmonic time-stepped 
model is presented in [83]. It is found that a rotor inter -
nal fault can lead to significant increase in the harmonic 
emissions in the spectra of stator current, power, speed, 
torque, and vibration. The magnitudes of slip-dependent 
fault-related harmonics show significant increases under 
rotor internal faults. This can be used as a reliable fault 
indicator.

Rotor internal faults and unbalanced rotor resistance 
are investigated in [84]. The proposed detection tech -
nique is constructed using the stator current, reactive 
power, and rotor modulating voltage, and this system is 
verified under several fault severities as well as differ -
ent wind speeds. Discrimination between rotor internal 
faults and unbalanced rotor resistance is proposed based 
on a fault indicator extracted from tracing fault-related 
harmonics. The frequency components that may appear 
in stator reactive power spectrum and rotor modulating 
signals, because of rotor asymmetry, are given respec -
tively as [71]:
 where ff
Qs and ff
ir are the harmonic orders induced in 
the stator reactive power spectrum and rotor modulat -
ing signals, respectively, because of rotor asymmetry. 
i∗=1, 2, 3, .... is an integer that refers to the supply 
harmonics.
Using a time-stepped model, reference [85] investigates 
the influence of velocity ripples and machine inertia on 
the emission of fault-related harmonics as a result of a 
rotor internal fault. Results show that DFIG rotor asym -
metries increase the harmonic emission in the stator cur -
rent spectrum, and this can be used as a fault detection 
index. The ability to detect these fault-related harmon -
ics is severely influenced by velocity fluctuations and 
machine inertia. It is found that the magnitudes of these 
fault-related harmonics are inversely proportional to the 
machine inertia. However, the velocity ripples signifi -
cantly change the harmonic orders of these fault-related 
components.
Based on the Luenberger observer, the detection of 
rotor asymmetries is introduced in [86, 87] to analyze 
the behavior of the stator residuals using a hybrid DFIG 
model in Matlab/Simulink. The main advantage of this 
observer-based method is its firmness against reference 
value steps. This method also has the ability to calculate 
the fault current (immeasurable in other methods), which 
can be used to calculate the thermal and magnetic effect 
of rotor internal faults. Results confirm that the proposed 
model has good sensitivity and high speed for detection.
Harmonic-based fault detection methods make use of 
the increase of harmonic emission that accompanies dif -
ferent faults, though the harmonic order may change as a 
result of speed variation. WTs usually operate under vari -
able speed conditions and consequently it may be difficult 
to predict the harmonic order of these fault-related har -
monics. To overcome this challenging issue, many methods (24)ff
Qs=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglei∗±n
p(1−s)±j/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglef1
(25) ff
ir=− sf1have been proposed to trace these fault-related harmon -
ics. These necessitate an additional set of processing algo -
rithms. In this regard, simplified automated fault detection 
for rotor electrical asymmetries is presented in [88], which 
uses a set of band pass filters that encompasses the ranges 
in which the fault-related harmonics are expected to occur 
in the stator current. These filters are designed to extract 
information to train a classifier for automatic fault detec -
tion, regardless of the specific location of the peaks. This 
can minimize the computational time. Results show that 
this technique is robust even under high-speed fluctuations 
and has a good accuracy against different fault levels.
3.2  Rotor current spectrum analysis
FS and DWT are applied to rotor modulating signals in [89, 
90] to detect rotor internal faults under time and speed var -
ying conditions, respectively. Based on the optimized use 
of the DWT, a simple processing technique is introduced 
and the results prove that rotor voltages are more sensi -
tive than rotor currents, even when the machine is driven 
by a closed-loop control system where the rotor currents 
are continuously adapted to maintain the machine at syn -
chronism and control active and reactive power. A dynamic 
time–frequency fault severity indicator is introduced to 
establish a preventive maintenance plan.
The use of negative-sequence components to detect 
rotor internal faults is proposed in [91– 93]. Results show 
that fault severity has a significant impact on the genera -
tion of those components as well as the phase difference 
of the line currents. It is observed that the third and fifth 
harmonics are induced when the rotor suffers from an 
internal fault, while a negative-sequence third harmonic is 
noticeable when the grid is unbalanced. This can be used to 
distinguish the two different types of faults. FEM is intro -
duced in [94] to detect rotor internal faults in DFIG using 
negative-sequence components. Based on the field circuit 
coupled approach, a model of the machine is constructed 
using ANSYS Maxwell 2D. This approach shows that as the 
fault severity enlarges, so does the negative-sequence rotor 
current. It is found that phase difference and positive- and 
negative-sequences of rotor current analysis may be con -
sidered as reliable fault indicators.
The use of dq-axis error signals is presented in [95] to 
detect rotor internal faults, which are calculated as:
(26)εidr(t)∼=−∞/summationdisplay
n=1Idr±2ncos/parenleftbig
2π(±2nsf 1/parenrightbig

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Page 11 of 22
 Bebars et al. Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems            (2022) 7:18 
 
 where εidr and εiqr are the rotor current error signals, Idr 
and Iqr are the harmonic magnitudes of the d- and q-axis 
rotor currents, and ∅dr and ∅qr are the harmonic phase 
shifts of the d- and q-axis rotor currents. Results show 
that the proposed method offers an enhanced sensitivity 
in comparison to stator current or total power signals.
Based on the time–frequency analysis of rotor cur -
rents, a speed sensorless method for detecting rotor 
internal faults in a WRIM working under non-stationary 
operation conditions is proposed in [96]. The mathemati -
cal formula for harmonic orders that may appear in the 
rotor current spectrum because of a rotor internal fault 
is given as:
 where f is the induced harmonic order, and 
k∗=0,±1,±2,±3, ... is an integer. In this method, the 
diagnostic results are always presented as a simple graph 
with all fault-related harmonics located exactly in the 
same position (the same harmonic order) regardless of 
the working condition (rotational speed) of the machine, 
which represents a great advantage for this method. 
Another advantage of this method is that it may be 
used to monitor the machine with a reduced number of 
parameters to improve condition monitor systems.
A space vector named hybrid fault index (HFI) is pre -
sented in [97, 98] to detect rotor internal faults using sig -
nature analysis of the space vector. The HFI is given by 
the product of rotor voltage and current space vectors, 
while the rotor current and voltage space vectors under 
rotor internal fault are given as:
 where ir and vr are the rotor current and voltage space 
vectors, respectively. ω is the fundamental angular fre -
quency, If and vf are the maximum value of the rotor cur -
rent and voltage at angular frequency sω , respectively. 
I−sf and v−sf are the maximum value of the respective 
rotor current and voltage at angular frequency sω, and ∅ 
is the phase shift.
The amplitude of the DC component of the HFI 
can be regarded as a reliable fault index, as it may be 
neglected under normal operation but becomes sig -
nificant under rotor internal faults, under both steady-
state and time-varying conditions. The main advantages 
of this technique are its high accuracy, robustness even 
under time-varying conditions, and low computational 
time due to no use of time–frequency signal processing 
techniques.(28) f=/parenleftbig

−sωt−∅−sf.v/parenrightbigUsing a Luenberger observer, a state-space observer-
based condition monitoring technique for detecting 
rotor internal faults is presented in [99] with the aid of 
a reduced-order time-invariant DFIG model. The main 
advantage of the observer is its ability to calculate the 
fault current which helps to evaluate the fault sever -
ity and permits a limited operation until maintenance. 
Results show that the model has high accuracy and fast 
detection ability for different fault levels at different wind 
speeds.
Based on the RMS values of the wavelet coefficient and 
the rotor current, another method for detecting rotor 
faults is proposed in [100] that calculates the fault sever -
ity using spectral analysis. Results show that the pro -
posed processing algorithm is convenient for detecting 
rotor faults and calculating the fault severity. Also, the 
proposed technique has good accuracy in detecting rotor 
faults under different loading conditions as well as differ -
ent fault scenarios.
Reference [101] proposes a detection technique that 
combines a condition monitoring system and particle 
swarm optimization based on rotor current analysis. The 
technique has the advantage of a lower computational 
time than other techniques. Results show that the pro -
posed technique can detect rotor faults effectively and 
robustly even under different rotational speeds. Also, 
the technique has high reliability and can reduce error 
signals. This can thus be used for precise maintenance 
planning.
3.3  Stator and rotor current spectrum analysis
Reference [102] proposes the use of five different fault 
measures from stator and rotor currents to detect rotor 
faults. The first can be verified by measuring the ampli -
tudes of stator current fault-related harmonics which can 
be calculated as [103]:
The second piece of fault evidence can be verified by 
measuring the amplitudes of fault-related harmonics 
amplified by the rotor fault. These harmonics can be used 
to distinguish rotor damage and other effects, such as the 
presence of load oscillations since they are less affected 
by pulsations in the driven load torque. The mathemati -
cal formulae used to calculate the second family harmon -
ics are given as [103]:
The third piece of evidence can be provided by analyz -
ing the startup current detection of the V-shaped pattern (31) ffam 1=f1(1±2.n.s )
(32) ffam 21=f1[(6n−1)−6ns]
(33) ffam 22=f1[(6n−1)−(6n−2)s]
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Page 12 of 22 Bebars et al. Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems            (2022) 7:18 
caused by the fault-related harmonics in the time–fre -
quency domain [104]. The fourth piece of evidence is a 
fault severity factor based on the DWT of the startup cur -
rent. This relates the total energy of the startup current to 
the signal processed by the DWT. The result proves that a 
certain level of the fault severity factor is a good indicator 
for a rotor internal fault. The fifth indicator depends on 
tracing fault-related harmonics at −sf1 in the rotor cur -
rent space vector spectrum. The main advantage of this 
algorithm is the detection of rotor internal faults at dif -
ferent fault levels and operational conditions with high 
accuracy and without any false trip.
3.4  Power spectrum analysis
Based on CWT and power and speed signals, a condi -
tion monitoring technique to detect rotor internal faults 
in a DFIG is presented in [105]. The continuous wavelet 
transform for the power real-time signal is given as:
 where a is the wavelet scale, b is the wavelet time-shift 
parameter, P(t) is the power real-time signal, and ∅∗ is 
the conjugate of the mother wavelet function.
In this method, a band pass filter is implemented with 
its central frequency being controlled by the wind speed, 
and the filter bandwidth is accommodated to the speed 
fluctuation. Results show that it has low memory burden 
and low detection time. Its main disadvantage is that it 
cannot detect small faults, although their effect on the 
processed signal is still noticed. This can be explained by 
the fact that there are residual imbalances present in the 
auxiliary components in the rotor circuit, and the time 
varying rotational speed hides the fault-related compo -
nents, making them difficult to trace. Reference [106] 
discusses the effect of the control system on power sig -
nal-based rotor internal fault detection systems. Results 
show that the control system has a significant impact on 
rotor current signature analysis that must be taken into 
consideration during system tuning or pre-setting.
3.5  Magnetic flux
The impact of rotor internal faults on the magnetic cir -
cuit of a DFIG is presented in [107] based on coupled 
electromagnetic and thermal field analyses. FEM is used 
to analyze the characteristics of a magnetic field, tem -
perature distribution, and heat transfer during healthy 
and faulty operations. Results show that some harmonic 
components are more affected by the fault than others. 
Its main advantage is that it focuses on the thermal effect 
of the rotor internal fault and the hotspots combining it, 
which can be used to improve the thermal design and 
heat transfer in DFIG.(34) CWT (b,a)=1√|a|/integraldisplay∞
−∞P(t)∅∗/parenleftbiggt−b
a/parenrightbigg
dtA FEM of DFIG is presented in [108] and is used to 
study the effect of rotor internal faults on the magnetic 
circuit. The phase angle difference, the harmonic con -
tent of rotor currents, and the harmonic content of mag -
netic flux are also investigated. Results show that, as the 
fault severity grows, the air-gap magnetic flux becomes 
asymmetrical with a significant increase in both frac -
tional and even fault-related harmonic components. The 
phase angle and amplitude of the rotor currents change 
significantly with increase in the induced third harmonic 
component. This technique has good accuracy under 
different fault severities, although it has not been tested 
under variable speed operation.
3.6  Vibration
Based on the analysis of torque and vibration signals of 
WRIG, a numerical model is presented in [109] to study 
the influence of rotor internal faults on machine behavior. 
Results prove that the main effect of rotor internal faults 
is reflected as twice slip frequency ( 2sf ) in the torque 
signal. In addition, the fault-related harmonics that have 
been induced in the torque signal can also be traced in 
the vibration signal. This method is tested under differ -
ent rotational speeds with different fault scenarios and 
shows good detection accuracy. A radial basis function 
neural network (RBFNN) is used to detect rotor internal 
faults in [110] based on analyzing the magnetic circuit 
and rotor vibration characteristic, and is examined under 
different fault levels. Its main advantage is the high detec -
tion speed which reduces the computational time, while 
it is also independent of the machine parameters, which 
means less time is required during initialization and 
setup. Results show that during rotor internal faults, the 
exciting current and rotor vibration increase, while at the 
same time the reactive power is decreased.
Figure  6 illustrates a summary of different techniques 
that are used to detect rotor faults in a DFIG, while 
Table  2 represents a comparison among these different 
techniques.
4  Common detection methods
In this section, the common methods that can be used 
for the detection of both stator and rotor internal faults 
are reviewed. These techniques depend on tracing the 
fault related harmonics that may appear in the spectrum 
of different parameters in a DFIG. The main advantage 
of these detection algorithms is the extended protection 
zone including both the stator and the rotor at the same 
time. However, this may increase the computational bur -
den and time especially when taking into consideration 
the effect of wind speed variation and a closed-loop con -
trol system.

4.1  Stator current spectrum analysis
Reference [26] proposes the use of stator currents to detect 
both stator and rotor internal faults in a DFIG. A time-
stepped coupled-circuit model for the machine is presented 
to simulate the harmonics that may appear in the stator 
currents because of stator or rotor faults. Results show 
that the design of parts of the machine such as of the coil 
pitch and rotor skew have great effect on the magnitudes of 
these harmonic components. However, these results have 
not been tested under different speeds or fault levels. The 
mathematical expressions in (3) and (22) are employed to 
calculate the orders of harmonics that may appear in the 
stator current as a result of stator or rotor faults.
Stator reactive power is used in [111, 112] for detecting 
stator and rotor faults based on FFT. Results prove that 
both stator and rotor faults can be detected by tracing 
fault-related components located at twice the supply fre -
quency ( 2f1 ) and twice the slip frequency ( 2sf1 ). The sta -
tor reactive power under stator and rotor internal faults 
can be presented as: where Qs is the stator reactive power, Qs{dc} and 
/Delta1Qs{⌈2f1⌉} are the dc component and amplitude of the 
oscillating component at the frequency of /vextendsingle/vextendsingle2f1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle in the 
stator reactive power, respectively. vqs is the stator volt -
age component in q-axis, and i+
ds is the d-axis positive-
sequence component of the stator current. iusb
ds and ilsb
ds are 
the components of the stator current in d-axis at the fre -
quencies of 2f1 and −2f 1 , respectively.
In the study, severity factors are defined for both types 
of faults and are examined to check their reliability under 
several load conditions and wind speed. Harmonic-based 
detection methods suffer from a low detection ability 
when the machine is running at low slip, and thus the 
fault may remain undetected until the slip is changed. 
The severity factor for both stator and rotor faults are 
given as:
 where SFsf and SFrf are the severity factors under stator 
and rotor internal faults, respectively, and Qsn is the rated 
stator reactive power of the DFIG.
Based on instantaneous frequency (IF) extraction of 
the fault-related components in stator and rotor cur -
rents during speed fluctuation, an internal fault detection 
technique is presented in [113]. The proposed technique 
depends on tracing the increase in the fault-related com -
ponents and the characteristic patterns of the IF. Under (35)Qs=3

nonstationary conditions, the graphs of the IF of the 
fault-related components in the slip-frequency domain 
are straight lines. Additionally, the slope and y-intercep -
tion of these lines are unique for each type of fault and 
independent from the machine design, the amount of 
load, or speed variation. Therefore, the IF graphics are 
considered to be a reliable index for the detection and 
classification of the faults. Consequently, this approach 
has a very low risk of producing false detection.
Reference [114] proposes a detection methodology that 
employs probabilistic intelligence technique Bayesian 
classification together with stator voltage signature anal -
ysis using WRIG FEM. Generator behavior is examined 
under normal and abnormal conditions such as stator 
and rotor internal faults. Results indicate that if the Bayes 
classifier has been accurately tuned, it has high accuracy 
and can be used to enhance preventive maintenance 
strategies for the WRIG.
4.2  Rotor current spectrum analysis
Rotor modulating signals spectrum analysis is introduced 
in [115, 116] to detect both stator and rotor internal 
faults in a DFIG. Results prove that the rotor modulat -
ing signals have harmonic content that could be regarded 
as a reliable index for stator and rotor internal faults, in 
comparison to rotor and stator current. The harmonic 
frequencies that are expected to appear in the rotor mod -
ulating signals because of stator and rotor internal faults 
are given as:
 where fsa and fra are the harmonic frequencies related to 
stator and rotor internal faults, respectively.
The influence of the closed-loop control system must 
be taken into consideration when the detection of asym -
metries in DFIG is based on the signature analysis of 
electrical variables. The investigation presented in [117] 
discusses the behavior of fault-related components 
against different bandwidths of closed-loop regulators 
to determine the effectiveness of any detection system 
that may use those variables while the machine is being 
driven by a closed-loop control system. Also, a detec -
tion method is presented to detect stator and rotor inter -
nal faults through the signature analysis of pulse width 
modulated rotor voltages. The proposed approach proves 
its efficiency under variations of the current loop band -
width. Equations (38) and (39) are employed to calculate 
the harmonic frequencies that are expected to appear in 
the rotor modulating signals because of stator and rotor (38) fsa=(2−s)f1
(39) fra=− sf1internal faults, respectively. However, this method has 
not been tested under different speed or fault levels.
Loci of d- and q-axis rotor currents are presented 
in [30] for the detection of stator and rotor faults in a 
WRIG. Its main advantage is the ability to discriminate 
among the stator and rotor internal faults, and unbal -
anced supply voltage. Under healthy conditions, the 
direct and quadrature current vectors have the same 
amplitude. Consequently, the vector summation of the 
components has a circular shape regardless of load con -
dition. However, during a rotor fault, the rotor currents 
become unbalanced and the resultant vector summation 
becomes elliptical in shape. On the other hand, during 
stator faults, higher-order harmonics are generated in 
rotor circuit making vector summation of rotor current 
components a leaf-shape structure. The number of leaf-
shaped structures is mathematically expressed as:
 where Nl is number of leaf-shaped structure and Dh is 
the order of the dominant harmonic component.
The size of a leaf-shaped structure is directly propor -
tional to space harmonic index and can be mathemati -
cally expressed as:
 where HI is the harmonic index, AD is the amplitude of 
dominant harmonic in the rotor current, and Af is the 
amplitude of the fundamental component in the rotor 
current.
A fault detection method based on a sliding mode 
observer is proposed in [118], where a mathematical 
model for this sliding mode observer is employed with a 
state-space model of a DFIG. Results shows that the tech -
nique has good stability and fast detection speed. This 
method has also been verified under different wind speed 
and fault levels.
4.3  Stator and rotor current spectrum analysis
References [119, 120] propose a detection technique 
based on signature analysis of both stator and rotor cur -
rents to detect internal faults in a DFIG. This technique 
has been tested under different fault degrees, but not 
under different wind speed. The mathematical expres -
sions in (3) and (22) are employed to calculate the order 
of harmonics that may appear in the stator current spec -
trum because of stator or rotor internal faults.
In [121], the behavior of a WRIG under both stator and 
rotor internal faults is investigated. Simulations using 
qd model in a stationary reference frame in MATLAB/
Simulink are carried out to investigate the behavior of (40) Nl=Dh+1
(41) HI=AD

different parameters in the machine such as electro -
magnetic torque, rotor speed, and stator and rotor cur -
rents under asymmetrical operation. It shows that under 
internal faults, the time and size of ripples in torque and 
rotor speed signals are changed and additional fluctua -
tions in steady-state are also detected. Moreover, dur -
ing the winding fault, the harmonic components change 
significantly in both the stator and rotor currents in 
steady-state and transient. The total harmonic distortions 
(THD) are measured for both rotor and stator currents 
under faulty and healthy operation. Results show that in 
the case of stator and/or rotor internal faults, rotor cur -
rents have higher THD compared to that of stator cur -
rents. This can be explained by the fact that the rotor is 
already connected to a back-to-back converter which 
increases the harmonic emission because of its high-
speed switching nature. Results demonstrate that during 
rotor internal faults, the calculated THD is always higher 
than the stator internal fault condition.
A WRIG is simulated in [122] under both stator and 
rotor internal faults using the complete MEC model. The 
differences between rotor and stator internal faults such 
as the amplitude of the fault current, the effect of fault 
severity load level on the fault current, and phase differ -
ence between the fault current and stator and rotor cur -
rents are presented. The main advantage of the proposed 
model is that it takes into consideration some elements 
from the magnetic circuit such as stator and rotor teeth 
local saturation, rotor slot skewing, the effect of stator 
and rotor teeth, and space harmonics in the stator and 
rotor circuit on the behavior of the detection system.
An internal fault detection technique based on stator 
electrical signals (voltage and current) and rotor cur -
rents is investigated in [123]. An FEM of the machine is 
presented under healthy and unhealthy operational con -
ditions and different fault degrees to produce an initial 
design and test procedure for the detection system. The 
results indicate that the stator signals and rotor current 
demonstrate a reliable index for detecting the investi -
gated faults. It is found that the detection system has 
good detectability due to the large amount of information 
extracted by the combination of these signals.
4.4  Magnetic flux
External leakage flux sensor is used in [124] to detect 
both stator and rotor internal faults in WRIGs instead of 
using the common technique of MCSA. The technique is 
simple as the physical connection between the machine 
and the flux sensor is not required. The harmonic fre -
quencies that appear in the flux spectrum because of 
rotor and stator internal faults are presented as:where frotor and fstator  are the flux induced harmon -
ics due to rotor and stator internal faults, respectively. 
γ=0, 1, 2, 3, ... is an integer, Nr is the number of rotor 
slots, and ξ=0, 1, 2, .... is also an integer.
4.5  Artificial neural networks (ANN)
An ANN with digital inputs is used in [125] to detect 
and localize internal faults in a DFIG. This method is 
based on the back-propagation algorithm which makes 
its architecture uncomplicated while also not requiring 
large computational time. Because of its efficiency and 
simplicity, it can be used in industrial development with 
basic hardware to decrease the cost of modern condition 
monitoring systems adapted to wind farms.
Reference [123] investigates the use of artificial intel -
ligence to detect both rotor and stator faults in WRIGs. 
It is found that the normalized frequency-based mag -
nitudes of several harmonics of the stator voltage and 
current, and rotor current exhibit patterned variations 
when the machine is subjected to an internal fault. It pro -
poses to use machine learning algorithms to enhance the 
accuracy of the detection system. The work presented 
in [126] suggests combinations of condition monitoring 
techniques and a machine-learning algorithm to detect 
both rotor and stator faults in WRIGs. The work aims to 
develop an unsupervised learning algorithm as a means 
of recognizing fault related patterns which in return 
will reduce the computational burden and increase sys -
tem accuracy even with small faults. A high-dimensional 
K-means modelling approach is used to develop diag -
nostic models for the machine under different incipient 
fault conditions. The findings from this model indicate 
that stator current harmonics provide the best results 
among the single-signature harmonics feature sets, while 
the combined set of harmonics from all signatures yield 
excellent model structures when measured against the 
ground truth.
Figure  7 illustrates a summary of different techniques 
that are used to detect stator and rotor faults in a DFIG, 
while Table  3 presents comparisons for these different 
techniques.

system is one of the available products which is equipped 
with vibration, temperature, and speed sensors as shown 
in Fig.  8. The system is also equipped with a computer-
based analysis tool that interprets the readings obtained 
from different sensors and presents them in a sim -
ple graph. This system is capable of detecting several 
mechanical problems such as eccentricity and bearing 
issues.
Figure  9 shows the Miniotec’s compact wireless vibra -
tion monitor technology. This solution comprises three 
main components, i.e., wireless sensor, cloud computing, 
and machine learning algorithm. The system does not 
require any hardwiring between the sensors and the main 
system as the signals are transmitted using Wi-Fi connec -
tivity. However, all the sensors in the system are powered 
by a battery which must be periodically replaced, while 
the usage of Wi-Fi connectivity also leads to a poten -
tial cyber-security problem. The system is capable of 
detecting several electrical and mechanical faults such 
as unbalanced misalignment, bearing faults, looseness, 
and cavitation as well as electrical faults such as rotor bar 
faults and winding faults.
The Baker EXP4000 dynamic motor analyzer is another 
product in the market for rotating equipment condition 
monitoring using MCSA. By monitoring many different 
parameters and using advanced software algorithms, it provides a highly accurate root-cause analysis, starting 
with the separation of mechanical and electrical issues 
that may be present in the machine system. The system 
can detect a wide range of problems such as broken rotor 
bars, transient overloading, and mechanical imbalances 
along with bearing and cavitation problems.

predictive maintenance condition monitoring system 
can be used to detect several mechanical and electrical 
faults such as loose foundation, mechanical imbalance, Table 3 A comparison among different techniques used to detect DFIG both rotor and stator faults

rotor internal electrical faults, and external electrical 
faults. It is also equipped with software that performs 
a high-speed analysis with clear information for fault 
detection, diagnostics, time to failure, and corrective 
actions.
The Samotics SAM4 can be used to detect many elec -
trical and mechanical faults inside induction machines 
such as stator inter-turn fault, stator winding loose -
ness, electrical imbalance, broken/loose rotor bars, rotor 
eccentricities, misalignment, bearing degradation, and 
mechanical imbalance. Similar to the Artesis MCM, it 
also comes with software that provides continuous real-
time information on the health, performance, and energy 
consumption of the machine.
6  Challenges and future trends
Although there are many techniques that can be used 
to detect internal electrical faults in DFIG-based WTs, 
there are several challenges and future trends, summa -
rized as follows:
• Most of the fault detection approaches assume that 
the measuring instruments or sensors (current, volt -
age, power, etc.) work in ideal operation modes. 
However, they may be subjected to saturation due to 
the rapid increase in fault current in a DFIG, while 
measuring instrument error or mismatch may also 
cause severe problems as it may fail to accurately rep -
resent the required waveforms. The detection system 
may malfunction in terms of the accuracy of fault 
identification and detection time. Therefore, it is rec -
ommended that further investigations should be car -
ried out to study the quality and cost of the sensors 
and establish an algorithm to overcome this issue.
• Accurate identification of a specific fault type and 
its location is very challenging in a DFIG as the con -
trol system continuously adapts the machine param -
eters as a result of wind speed variation to keep the 
machine in synchrony. In addition, the load level, 
grid parameters, temperature influence, and even 
machine geometry are important parameters that 
affect the accuracy of fault identification. Current 
fault detection systems mainly rely on analyzing the 
response of the DFIG, i.e., establishing a reliable fault-
related pattern that may be used as a fault index. As 
the occurrence of one fault inside the machine may 
be combined with other faults, it becomes even more 
challenging to detect all the faults. Also, the existence 
of the back-to-back converter in the rotor circuit and 
its induced harmonics due to its switching need fur -
ther investigation. Therefore, more research should be conducted to investigate the behavior of the exist -
ing internal fault detection techniques when they are 
subjected to several faults at the same time. It is also 
recommended to take into consideration the effect of 
the control system, the load nature, grid parameters, 
and the effect of the back-to-back converter.
• There are insufficient in-depth studies on the precise 
identification of internal faults threshold in a DFIG. 
In a model-based fault diagnostic procedure or a 
real-time condition monitoring system, the thresh -
old plays an important role. The fault threshold is 
closely linked to the fault diagnostic capability of 
the fault detection technique, and the setting of the 
threshold has not been investigated or addressed 
in current research. Determining the threshold is 
a trade-off between the ability to detect small faults 
and false alarming. Furthermore, the aging of a DFIG 
will impact the accuracy of the threshold. Thus, more 
research should be conducted to study the modi -
fication of threshold against DFIG age taking into 
consideration different machine parameters such as 
rated power, operational voltage, losses, and machine 
cooling system.
• As most of the turn-to-turn faults inside any machine 
are the result of severe thermal stress on the machine 
windings that has led to insulation degradation, it is 
very important to establish an accurate thermal man -
agement system for DFIG units. This system should 
guarantee that the operating temperature of the unit 
remains within a certain range where the DFIG can 
produce a suitable performance without causing any 
damage to the WT. However, there has been little 
research on the thermal management strategy that 
can be employed in real DFIG-based WT systems. 
Thus, more research should be conducted to investi -
gate the optimization of a DFIG cooling system.
• It is recommended to enhance the accuracy of fault 
severity calculation techniques, construct the inter -
nal electrical fault ride-through capability algorithm, 
and study the internal faults in brushless DFIG.
• More research should be done focusing on the appli -
cation of artificial intelligence techniques such as 
ANN. These new techniques can increase the reli -
ability of the detection methods and reduce compu -
tational burden. Also, data science is one of the most 
essential tools for estimating the occurrence of differ -
ent internal DFIG faults. Moreover, using the Inter -
net of Things (IoT), cloud platforms, and Fog, system 
monitoring is improved, data and information stor -
age is enhanced, and reasonable decision-making 
time is ensured. It is also necessary to study the cyber 
security of modern communication systems.

7  Conclusion
In this paper, the detection and diagnosis methods of 
internal faults in DFIG-based WTs have been reviewed. 
Finding a reliable DFIG online condition monitoring 
system has become a very important research topic for 
over a decade. The main requirements are high detection 
accuracy, early detection of the fault, and low computa -
tional requirement. A reliable detection system will allow 
the operator to build and create an accurate maintenance 
plan resulting in cost reduction. The internal fault detec -
tion techniques of DFIG-based WTs can be summarized 
as follows:
• Stator current-based methods: They are robust and 
low-cost, and their main limitation is the high sensi -
tivity to any abnormalities that may occur in the sys -
tem.
• Rotor current-based methods: they are robust meth -
ods with no need for any external sensors as the 
built-in sensors in the back-to-back converter can be 
used for this purpose. However, these methods are 
very sensitive to speed fluctuations.
• Wavelet analysis-based methods: the methods have a 
multi-resolution detection scope. Their main draw -
back is that they are not sensitive to minor faults.
• Magnetic equivalent circuit-based methods: the 
methods provide high accuracy for fault detection, 
though they are easily affected by machine param -
eters such as geometry, and number of poles.
• Fourier analysis-based methods: these methods pro -
vide fast detection. The main drawback is how they 
are affected by speed fluctuations.
• MCSA based methods: these methods provide high 
accuracy. However, they can be easily affected by a 
change in torque or speed.
• Vibration-based methods: their main advantage is 
simplicity as they do not require complicated math -
ematical models or algorithms, while their main dis -
advantage is the requirement for additional sensors 
to be connected to the machine which makes the 
system more expensive and complicated. The sensor 
mismatch could also affect the reliability of the sys -
tem leading to a false trip.
• Flux-based methods: The main advantage of these 
methods is their high accuracy, while the main dis -
advantage is that additional sensors are also required 
which affect the reliability and cost of the operational 
system, and increase the complexity of the system. 
These methods also require a considerable amount 
of information to be fed to the detection algorithm 
which in return represents a high computational bur -
den to the system.These methods have been discussed in detail and com -
pared with each other in this paper. Each technology has 
advantages and disadvantages, and operators need to 
choose a suitable method based on the operating con -
ditions and the surrounding environment. Some of the 
real monitoring systems available in the market are also 
presented. Finally, the challenges and future trends fac -
ing the techniques are discussed. This work is organized 
in a tutorial manner, to be an effective guide for future 
research, and to play a role in enhancing the stability and 
reliability of DFIG-based WTs.
