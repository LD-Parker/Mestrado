  This paper presents a stator winding faults detection in induction generator 
based wind turbines by using artificial neural network (ANN). Stator winding 
faults of induction generators are the most common fault found in wind 
turbines. This fault may lead t o wind turbine failure. Therefore, fault detection 
in induction generator based wind turbines is vital to increase the reliability of 
wind turbines. In this project, the mathematical model of induction generator 
based wind turbine was developed in MATLAB S imulink. The value of 
impedance in the induction generators was changed to simulate the inter -turn 
short circuit and open circuit faults. The simulated responses of the induction 
generators were used as inputs in the ANN model for fault detection 
procedure s. A set of data was taken under different conditions, i.e. normal 
condition, inter -turn short circuit and open circuit faults as inputs for the ANN 
model. The target outputs of the ANN model were set as ‘0’ or ‘1’, based on 
the fault conditions. Results o btained showed that the ANN model can detect 
different types of faults based on the output values of the ANN model.  
In conclusion, the stator winding faults detection procedure for induction 
generator based wind turbines by using ANN was successfully deve loped.

1. INTRODUCTION   
Wind Turbines have become one of the important topics and treated as a future technology because 
it’s clean, free, reliable and it efficiency [1]. It is also become a major supplier of consumer electricity. With 
an increasing number of wind turbines in use , monitoring the condition of wind turbine becomes an important 
aid for mainten ance and improved reliability [2 -7]. Based on a report from Germany, 23.5% of wind turbines 
turbine breakdowns in 2009 was due to generator failures [8 ].  Out of this percentage, bearing related faults are 
most common leading with 40%; followed by stator related faults, 38% and rotor related faults, 10% [9 ].  
This showed that stator winding fault is one of the major faults occurring in wind turbine gener ators. Stator 
winding faults are related to failure involving stator winding short cir cuit and open circuit [10 -11]. Inter -turn 
short circuit fault is the most common stator winding faults. It is very serious as it may cause a rapid rise in 
temperature nea r the short circuit turns, which may further result in the destruction of the insulation for  
the turns, which leads to coil and winding short circuits and even c atastrophic machine failures [12 ].  
Previously, there were few researches on fault detection f or wind turbi nes. In [13 -14], fault detection 
of wind turbine using SCADA data were presented. Artificia l neural network was used in [15 ] for fault 
detection of wind turbine via current signature analysis. A method for sensor validation and fault detection  in 
wind turbine by using ANN was proposed in [16 ]. Fault detection of wind energy conversion system based on

Stator winding fault detection  of induction generator based wind turbine using ANN  (N. F. Fadzail ) 127 
dynamic neu ral network was developed in [17 ]. The presented fault detection system detects faults in  
the generator’s angular velocity sensors, pi tch angle sens ors, and pitch actuators. In [18 ], an imbalance fault 
detection algorithm for variable -speed wind turbines using neural network was proposed. This paper focuses 
on wind turbine blade imbalance faults. A fault detection of incipient faults of short -circuits in inductio n 
generators was designed in [19 ] using mac hine learning. Meanwhile, in [20 ] wound rotor induction generator 
inter-turn short circuit diagnosis using a new digital neural network was presented.  
Many previous studies proposed a me thod of fault detection for wind turbines form SCADA data. 
Some of these research were not focused on generator faults in wind turbines. Therefore, this limits  
the capability of a fault detection method when a fault occurs in the generator, especially for  inter-turn short 
circuit and open circuit stator windings. Artificial neural network is a common method used in fault detection 
due to its capability to dete ct different types of faults [21 ].  An artificial neural network could be applied to a 
wide range of tasks like signal processing, pattern recognition, function approximation, and classification [22] . 
An artificial neural network is the computation of biological neurons connected by weights that are modified 
during use to satis fy the performance criter ion [23 -24]. Neural networks are qualified as a universal 
approximators, they can mimic every complex function  [25].  
This paper presents , the mathematical model of an induction generator based wind turbine was 
developed in M ATLAB Simulink.  As stated in [9 , 26], the fault condition would change the impedance of  
the winding, affecting the resistance and the winding inductance would change as well. Therefore, in this 
project, t he value of impedance of the induction generator was changed to simulate the inter -turn short circuit 
and open circuit faults. T he impedance of the induction generator was changed by 0.1 times the normal value 
to simulate the inter -turn fault [2 7]. Inter -turn short circuit fault was considered to have only a small resistance. 
Therefore,  its resistance could be assumed zero [ 12, 28]. Meanwhile, the inductance of the induction generator 
was changed by 10 times the normal value to sim ulate the open circuit fault [2 8]. The simulation results of  
the induction generator were used as inputs in  the ANN model for fault detection. There were four inputs; 
which were stator current, electrical torque, mechanical torque and rotor speed. A  set of data was taken under 
different conditions, i.e. normal condition, inter -turn short circuit and open circui t faults, as inputs for t he ANN 
model for training prose s. The target outputs of the ANN model were set as ‘0’ or ‘1’, based on the fault 
condition. After the training process was successful, the ANN model was tested and validated with different 
values of input under different conditions.  
 
 
2. FAULT DETECTION METHOD  
2.1.   Faulty condition  
Wind  generation with induction generator was developed in MATLAB Simulink. The wind turbine 
model included three main components which were aerodynamics, drivetrain and gen erator. The model was 
simulated under normal condition with parameter value of stator phase resistance, RS=0.425 Ω, inductance on 
d-axis, Ld=0.0082 H and inductance on q -axis, Lq=0.0082 H.  
In simulating the fault conditions, the parameter values RS, Ld  and  Lq were changed to RS =0.0425 Ω, 
Ld =0.00082 H and Lq =0.00082 H which were 0.1 times the normal value to produce the inter -turn short circuit 
fault. Then, the parameter values RS, Ld and Lq were changed to RS =4.25 Ω, Ld =0.082 H and Lq =0.082 H 
which were 10 times the normal value to replicate the open circuit fault. Later, the responses of stator current, 
IS, rotor speed, Wm, electrical torque, Te and mechanical torque, Tm were measured. These simulated responses 
were used to develop the ANN model  for fault detection and classification procedures.  
 
2.2. Artificial neural network  
The fault detect ion procedure is shown in Figure 1. All the simulated responses ( IS, Te, Tm and Wm) 
were used to develop the ANN model for fault detection. The target output of ANN m odel were set as shown 
in Figure 1 . Basically, neural networks are trained until the output follow th e target output. Figure 2  shows  
the adjustment of ANN training process. The ANN will be trained with the inputs by adjusting the weight unt il 
the output matches the target output.  
Figure 3  represents the structure of the neural network used in MATLAB for the training process.  
The ANN model for fault detection was developed with four inputs and three outputs. The inputs of ANN 
model were stat or current, IS, electrical torque, Te, mechanical torque, Tm and rotor speed,  Wm. Moreover,  
the outputs of ANN model were X, Y and Z. The outputs of X, Y and Z were set as ‘0’ and ‘1’ based on fault 
conditions. Table 1 shows the target output of the ANN model. It consists of three conditions which are normal, 
inter-turn short circuit fault and op en circuit fault.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
A fault occurred at 7 second in the simulation. There are two types of fault responses which are  
inter-turn short circuit and open circuit faults . Figure 4  shows the simulated responses for stator current, IS 
under normal condition with inter -turn short circuit fault occurring at 7 second while F igure 5  shows  
the response of stator current, IS under normal condition with open circuit fault at 7 second. Base d on  
the figures, the inter -turn fault current led to high peak fault current and the stator current dropped during  
the open circuit fault. The inter -turn short circuit current caused an instantaneous shock to the current as shown 
in Figure 4.  
Figure 6 shows the responses for rotor speed, Wm under normal condition with inter -turn short circuit 
fault at 7 second. Figure 7 shows the responses for rotor speed, Wm for normal condition with open circuit fault 
at 7 second. Noticeable, the rotor speed of induction generator decreased during inter -turn short circuit fault 
and increased during open circuit fault.  
The simulated responses for electrical torque, Te under normal condition during inter -turn short circuit 
fault at 7 second is shown in Figure 8.  Additionally, the simulated responses for electrical torque, Te under 
normal condition with open circuit fault at 7 second is shown in Figure 9. The inter -turn short circuit fault 
caused the electrical torque to increase whereas the open circuit fault dec reased the electrical torque.

The simulated responses for mechanical torque, Tm under normal condition during inter -turn short 
circuit fault at 7 second is shown in Figure 10 while Figure 11 presents the simulated responses for mechanical 
torque, Tm under normal condition with open circuit fault at 7 second. The simulated responses s howed that 
when inter -turn short circuit fault happened, the responses for mechanical torque, Tm reduced. Meanwhile,  
the responses for mechanical torque,  Tm  increased as open circuit fault occurred.  
After the training process was satisfactory, the ANN mo del for fault detection was tested. The ANN 
model was tested and validated with different input values. Table 2 shows the results of the test and validation 
of the ANN model under different conditions. The results showed that the output of ANN model tallie d with 
the target output.

Figure 12 and Figure 13 present the classification results under different fault conditions. The output 
value in Figure 12 clearly shown that the target output is [0; 1; 0]. This indicated that the induction generator 
based wind turbine experienced an inter -turn short circuit fault. Meanwhile, the output vector in Figure 13 is 
[0; 0; 1] which indicated that an open c ircuit fault occurred.  
Based on the result of the ANN model for fault classification, it can be observed that the ANN model 
can detect accurately the different types of faults based on stator current, IS, electrical torque, Te, mechanical 
torque, Tm and ro tor speed,  Wm. The accuracy of the fault detection procedure confirmed the effectiveness of 
the stator winding fault detection in induction generator based wind turbines.

4. CONCLUSION   
In conclusion, the developed ANN model was proven to be a less complicated method to detect 
different types of faults as it was developed by data training from simulated responses of wind turbines. 
Moreover, the developed ANN model for fault detection had shown good efficiency, based on the output and 
target values of  the ANN fault classifier model, which were exactly the same. Therefore, the stator winding 
fault detection and classification procedure for induction generator based wind turbine by using ANN was 
successfully developed.
