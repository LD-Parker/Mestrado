Abstract: This paper presents a short-term wind turbine (WT) outage model based on the data collected
from a wind farm supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. Neural networks (NNs)
are used to establish prediction models of the WT condition parameters that are dependent on
environmental conditions such as ambient temperature and wind speed. The prediction error
distributions are discussed and used to calculate probabilities of the operation of protection relays
(POPRs) that were caused by the threshold exceedance of the environmentally sensitive parameters.
The POPRs for other condition parameters are based on the setting time of the operation of protection
relays. The union probability method is used to integrate the probabilities of operation of each
protection relay to predict the WT short term outage probability. The proposed method has been
used for real 1.5 MW WTs with doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs). The results show that the
proposed method is more effective in WT outage probability prediction than traditional methods.

1. Introduction
In consideration of the intermittency and randomness of wind power, the large-scale wind
power integration has a great inﬂuence on the safe and stable operation of the electrical power
system [ 1,2]. In view of this, the electrical power system in China has clearly claimed to bring the
active output control of the wind farm into the power network dispatching management [ 3]. Currently,
the electric power system dispatching is mainly based on the short-term wind speed and wind power
prediction [4–6], which fails to consider the impact of wind turbine (WT) outages on the wind power
variation. Meanwhile, there is still a lack of warning information of the WT outages to support the
internal coordination control technologies of the wind farm [ 7,8]. In fact, due to the adverse natural
environment, the outage rate of the WT is far higher than that of the traditional electric transmission
and transformation equipment. Therefore, the WT short-term operational reliability evaluation is
an important foundation of the optimal dispatching of electrical power systems and the economic
operation of wind farms.
The short-term operational reliability evaluation of the power system equipment could provide
a quantitative description of short-term outage risks of the equipment in the future (minute, hour
and day) [ 9,10]. Because of the uncertainty of wind speed and wind direction, the operation points
of the WT change quite signiﬁcantly in the short term. Statistics show that the failure rate of the
WT equipment has a strong correlation with the external environment [ 11,12]. Furthermore, the

WT outages are also inﬂuenced by factors such as equipment aging, maintenance strategies, and
geographical environment. Some studies have been conducted to evaluate the reliability of WTs and
the important WT subassemblies [ 12–14]. However, these long-term reliability evaluation methods
cannot reﬂect the impacts of various operation conditions on WT reliability. It is difﬁcult to accurately
estimate the short-term WT outage probability based solely on the statistical data of WT faults.
Compared with the traditional electric transmission and transformation equipment, the WTs have
abundant condition monitoring data, which could provide comprehensive condition information for
the WT short-term operational reliability evaluation. The condition monitoring data of WTs are mainly
obtained from the wind farm supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. The SCADA
system can provide a large amount of monitoring parameters of the natural environment, equipment
operation and electricity system. To ensure the safe operation of WTs, once any parameters exceed their
threshold values of protection relays, the WT will be shut down. The short-term change in the SCADA
monitoring parameters are closely related to the external environment and operation condition of WTs.
By using advanced SCADA data mining methods, various condition parameter prediction models
have been developed to detect the signiﬁcant changes in WT behavior prior to fault occurrences [ 15–19].
These prediction models were established by employing data-driven approaches that involve neural
networks (NNs) [ 20–22], a support vector machine (SVM) [ 23], adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system
(ANFIS) [ 24], and the nonlinear state estimate technique (NSET) [ 25]. In [ 26], different WT performance
curves, such as the power curve, rotor curve, and blade pitch curve were modeled for monitoring
the performance of WTs. A nonlinear data-based modeling approach was proposed in [ 27] to detect
anomalies in WT generator winding and gearbox bearing. In [ 28], a NN based normal behavior model
of generator bearing temperature was developed to analyze bearing faults in WTs. A comparative
analysis of two NN-based models and a regression-based model was presented in [ 29] to detect
anomalies in gearbox bearing temperature and generator stator temperature.
The above studies are mainly for anomaly identiﬁcation of WT condition parameters. These WT
anomaly identiﬁcation models could provide a qualitative description of the WT health conditions.
However, since these methods do not consider the WT outage risks due to the anomalies in WT
condition parameters, it is difﬁcult to quantitatively evaluate the short-term operational reliability
of WTs. This challenge lead to the discovery of a new approach to predict the short-term WT outage
probability based on comprehensive SCADA monitoring parameters.
Currently, the wind farm operators usually use a power curve to estimate the expected WT output
power based on the predicted wind speeds. However, in order to reduce the outage probability and
the number of outages of WTs, power generation schedule for the low-reliability WTs with higher
outage probabilities should be adjusted by performing the active output power control of WTs. Hence,
the short-term WT outage probability prediction is useful for the wind farm operators to monitor the
WT condition and make proper active output power control strategies. Furthermore, since the WT
outages could impact the output power and power variation of a wind farm, the wind farm operators
should evaluate the potential wind power loss due to the WT outages according to the WT outage
probability prediction results and formulate appropriate power generation schedules for WTs and
wind farms.
This paper presents a short-term (i.e., 15-min-ahead) WT outage model based on condition
parameters obtained from the wind farm SCADA system. Prediction models are established to predict
condition parameters that are dependent on environmental conditions such as ambient temperature
and wind speed. The calculation for probabilities of protection operation caused by the threshold
exceedance of the component temperatures is based on the probability distributions of the prediction
errors of the developed prediction models. The calculation for probabilities of protection operation
for other monitoring parameters is based on the setting time of the protection operation. The union
probability method is utilized to integrate the probabilities of each protection relay to predict the WT
short term outage probability. The proposed method has been used for real 1.5 MW WTs with doubly
fed induction generators (DFIGs).

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: The SCADA data that can be used for the WT
outage model development are discussed and grouped in Section 2. Section 3 proposes the methodology
for developing the short-term outage model . The details in developing condition parameter prediction
models and the calculation for POPR are given in Sections 4 and 5. The procedure for predicting the
short-term WT outage probability is given in Section 6. Three cases are investigated to validate the
proposed short-term WT outage model in Section 7. The conclusions are given in Section 8.
2. Parameter Description and Classiﬁcation
Table 1 shows the typical condition parameters measured and delivered by the SCADA system
of a wind farm. The positions of corresponding sensors are shown in Figure 1. These condition
parameters can be grouped into two types:
Type 1 parameters include various component temperatures which are strongly inﬂuenced by
environmental conditions. For example, the relationship between the gearbox input shaft temperature
of a variable speed constant-frequency (VSCF) WT and the wind speed is shown in Figure 2. For the
VSCF WT, when the wind speed is below its rated speed, a faster rotational speed, due to a higher wind
speed, will evidently raise the temperature of the mechanical components. When the wind speed is
over the rated wind speed, the WT will be kept at its rated output power by variable pitch control and
the component temperatures will be less affected by the wind speed. Figure 3 shows the relationship
between the gearbox input shaft temperature and the ambient temperature. The heat dissipation of
mechanical components of a WT is also affected by the ambient temperature. At a lower ambient
temperature, the heat dissipation is faster and the component temperatures can vary in a larger range.
Conversely, at a higher temperature, the component temperature tolerable variation range is smaller
with slower heat dissipation. It is noted that the gearbox will produce a large amount of heat in the
operation of WTs [ 30]. In order to ensure the secure and stable operation of WT, an effective gearbox
cooling system has to be implemented. Therefore, the gearbox cooling water temperature, which has
a large impact on the gearbox component temperatures, is also considered as one of Type 1 condition
parameters. Moreover, wind speed has a major impact on the wind power output and WT component
temperatures, which is also classiﬁed into Type 1 parameters in this paper.
Type 2 parameters include yaw position, yaw angle error, and hydraulic oil pressure. Yaw position
represents the rotation angle of the nacelle. Yaw angle error is the angle between the wind and the
nacelle position. Type 2 parameters do not have an obvious relationship with environmental conditions.

3. Framework of the Wind T urbine Outage Model
Most of the wind farm SCADA monitoring parameters reﬂect the current condition of WTs and
power grid. In order to assure the safe operation of WTs, several outage protections are designed for
the WTs. Once any monitoring parameters exceed their threshold value, the corresponding protection
relays will be activated to stop WTs. Hence, based on the logical relationship between the WT outage
and the operation of each protection relay, the short-term operational reliability of WTs can be evaluated
by applying reliability theory of the series networks [ 31]. Therefore, the WT outage probability can be
calculated by using the union probability method [31,32] as follows:

where Firepresents the probability of the operation of the protection relay (POPR) for condition
parameter iandNis the number of condition parameters.
The POPR for Type 1 parameters: Figure 4 shows the framework of calculating the POPR for
the environmentally sensitive parameters (i.e., Type 1 parameters). First, the short-term wind speed
prediction model is established to predict the wind speed in the next 15 min. Since the WT outages
caused by the lower wind speeds have little inﬂuence on the WT output power ﬂuctuation, the WT
outage probability due to the wind speed lower than the cut-in wind speed is not considered. Then, the
15-min-ahead prediction models are developed to predict the Type 1 parameters at each predicted value
of wind speed. Finally, the threshold exceedance probabilities for Type 1 parameters are calculated based
on the prediction error distribution of the wind speed prediction model and Type 1 parameter prediction
models. Since the protection relays of Type 1 parameters do not have the time delay for the protection
action, the threshold exceedance probabilities of the Type 1 parameters are approximate to the POPR.
The POPR for Type 2 parameters: It is difﬁcult to predict the threshold exceedance probabilities
of Type 2 parameters by using the environmental parameters such as wind speed and ambient
temperature. In this paper, the POPRs for Type 2 parameters are estimated based on operation
principles of the protection relays.

outage probability  due to the wind speed lower than the cut‐in wind speed is not considered.  Then,

calculated  based on the prediction  error distribution  of the wind speed prediction  model and Type 1

the Type 1 parameters,  the error distribution  of the short‐term wind speed prediction  model should 
be analyzed.  Most study results indicate that the wind speed prediction  errors follow the normal 
distribution  [33,34]. In this paper, the autoregressive  moving average (ARMA)  model is used for 15‐
min‐ahead wind speed prediction  and the normal distribution  parameters  of prediction  errors are 
obtained.  The 10‐min averaged  wind speed data are used to develop the prediction  models. Figure 5 
shows the normal distribution  based probability  density function (PDF) of the wind speed prediction  
errors. Based on this, the prediction  errors are divided into nine regions (i.e., −∞ to −1.75 m/s, −1.75 
m/s to −1.25 m/s, …, 1.75 m/s to ∞), as seen in Figure 5. To simplify the calculation  of POPR for the 
Type 1 parameters,  the wind speed prediction  errors are discretized  into nine discrete values (i.e., 0 
m/s, ±0.5 m/s, ±1 m/s, ±1.5 m/s, ±2 m/s) corresponding  to the nine regions. The probability  for each

4.1. Wind Speed Prediction Model
Various studies have been done on the short-term wind speed prediction, however, the current
prediction models still have non-negligible prediction errors. To accurately calculate the POPR for
the Type 1 parameters, the error distribution of the short-term wind speed prediction model should
be analyzed. Most study results indicate that the wind speed prediction errors follow the normal
distribution [ 33,34]. In this paper, the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model is used for
15-min-ahead wind speed prediction and the normal distribution parameters of prediction errors are
obtained. The 10-min averaged wind speed data are used to develop the prediction models. Figure 5
shows the normal distribution based probability density function (PDF) of the wind speed prediction
errors. Based on this, the prediction errors are divided into nine regions (i.e.,  ¥to 1.75 m/s,
 1.75 m/s to 1.25 m/s, . . ., 1.75 m/s to ¥), as seen in Figure 5. To simplify the calculation of POPR
for the Type 1 parameters, the wind speed prediction errors are discretized into nine discrete values
(i.e., 0 m/s,0.5 m/s,1 m/s,1.5 m/s,2 m/s) corresponding to the nine regions. The probability
for each discrete prediction error can be calculated based on (2) and the results are shown in Table 2.

4.2. Prediction  Models of Component  Temperature  Parameters  
The 15‐min‐ahead prediction  models for component  temperature  parameters  are established  in 
this section. To develop the prediction  models, the following  three factors have been carefully  
considered:  (1) input parameters;  (2) training algorithm;  and (3) sample data. 
Input parameters:  For the VSCF WTs, the wind speed is one of the key factors that influence  the 
component  temperatures  [35]. Faster rotational  speed due to higher wind speed will evidently  raise 
the mechanical  component  temperatures.  Consequently,  the output power and the electrical  
component  temperatures  increase [35]. Moreover,  the ambient temperature  can impact on the heat 
dissipation  efficiency  of the WT components  and thus influence  the component  temperatures.  
Therefore,  based on the operating  characteristics  of the VSCF WTs, the wind speed v(t), the previous  
ambient temperature  Ta(t − 1) and the previous  component  temperature  Te(t − 1) are selected as input 
parameters  of the prediction  models of component  temperature  parameters  Te(t). 
Training  algorithm:  Back‐propagation  NN (BPNN),  a widely used NN for prediction,  is applied

4.2. Prediction Models of Component Temperature Parameters
The 15-min-ahead prediction models for component temperature parameters are established
in this section. To develop the prediction models, the following three factors have been carefully
considered: (1) input parameters; (2) training algorithm; and (3) sample data.
Input parameters: For the VSCF WTs, the wind speed is one of the key factors that inﬂuence the
component temperatures [ 35]. Faster rotational speed due to higher wind speed will evidently raise the
mechanical component temperatures. Consequently, the output power and the electrical component
temperatures increase [ 35]. Moreover, the ambient temperature can impact on the heat dissipation
efﬁciency of the WT components and thus inﬂuence the component temperatures. Therefore, based on
the operating characteristics of the VSCF WTs, the wind speed v(t), the previous ambient temperature
Ta(t 1) and the previous component temperature Te(t 1) are selected as input parameters of the
prediction models of component temperature parameters Te(t).
Training algorithm: Back-propagation NN (BPNN), a widely used NN for prediction, is applied
in this study for the prediction of the component temperature parameters. In consideration of the
size of the training set and the training time, the NN is chosen to have only one hidden layer and
the number of neurons in the hidden layer ranges from 2 to 10. The transfer function used in the
hidden layer is tan-sigmoid while the output layer transfer function is log-sigmoid based. The actual
number of nodes (i.e., neurons) in the hidden layer is determined by trial-and-error to ﬁnd the right
number at which the NN has the best generalization performance. The relationship between the
BPNN prediction performances of four component temperature parameters (i.e., gearbox input shaft
temperature, generator bearing atemperature, generator winding U temperature and main bearing a
temperature) of a WT and the number of hidden layer nodes (i.e., neurons) are taken as an example,
as shown in Figure 6. Based on this, the optimal hidden layer node numbers of the four prediction
models are chosen as 10, 8, 7, and 6 respectively.

When the wind speed varies within its low value region, it may cause frequent WT startup or
shutdown. Thus, the data collected during these periods of time have different stochastic characteristics
and should be ﬁltered out. To solve this problem, a lower limit of output power is set at 100 kW for the
1.5 MW WTs for sample data selection. In other words, only the data when the output power is greater
than 100 kW are used to train the NNs.
Furthermore, during certain instances in the operation of a WT, the output power can be curtailed
by adjusting the blade pitch angle. Figure 8 shows the measured power curve of a WT during two time
periods (i.e., 1–30 May 2011 and 1–5 June 2011) for example. The power curve in May is considered to
be in normal condition. However, the WT output power between 1 and 5 June was curtailed through
increasing the blade pitch angle, which can be seen in Figure 9. This reduction in output power for
a particular wind speed is due to change in control by the pitch regulation module and is not related to
a degraded condition of the WT [ 36]. Moreover, the prediction models could not provide an accurate
prediction since few SCADA data for this situation can be collected. Consequently, the data instances
in which the WT pitch control mechanism was engaged (based on the pitch blade angle reading) are
ﬁltered out.

(a) Data scaling: Data scaling is an important step when training the BPNN based prediction models.
The data scaling method can be expressed as follows:
ys=y ymin
ymax ymin(3)
where yis a variable and ysis the corresponding normalized variable.
(b) Missing data processing: Unknown or missing values are particularly harmful when training
the BPNNs. If they are not classiﬁed as not a number (i.e., NaN) but 999 for example, the BPNN
may try to ﬁt these values. This will reduce the prediction accuracy of the BPNN models. Hence,
it is necessary to clarify how the missing values are labeled in the SCADA system. Since there
is a large amount of SCADA data available, no approximation was performed in this paper.
Instead missing input and target values are processed by neglecting the data set [21].
Prediction performance analysis: To analyze the performance of the prediction models, metrics
such as mean absolute error ( MAE ), mean squared error ( MSE ), and mean absolute percentage error
(MAPE ) have been used, as shown in (4)–(6).

where nis the number of test samples, ˆyiis the predicted value for a time period i, and yiis the

Table 4 shows the prediction performance of the component temperature parameters of a WT.
Although the prediction accuracy of each component temperature is different, the maximum of MAE is
lower than 1C. The trained models are tested by using the test data in Table 3. The error residuals and
prediction error distributions for the gearbox input shaft temperature, the main bearing atemperature,
the generator bearing atemperature and the generator winding U temperature are given as an example,
as shown in Figures 10 and 11. It can be seen that the prediction errors coming from the successfully
trained prediction models are normally distributed with a mean around zero.

4.3. The Probabilities of the Operation of the Protection Relays for Type 1 Parameters
The POPR for component temperature parameters: According to the normal distribution
characteristics of the prediction error for component temperature parameters, the threshold exceedance
probabilities of the Type 1 parameters at the predicted wind speed can be calculated as:
Oi(vj) =P(Te>Tlim Tvj) =1 FNc(Tlim Tvj) (7)
where Teis the prediction error of the target component temperature; Tvjrepresents the predicted
value of the component temperature parameter iwhen the wind speed is vj;Tlimrepresents the upper
limit of the Type 1 parameter i; and FNc() represents the CDF of the prediction error.
The anomaly of WT condition parameters can be detected in advance through the normal
distribution characteristics of prediction error [ 22]. The existing statistical anomaly identiﬁcation
methods are mainly based on the assumption that normal instances occur in the high probability
region of a stochastic model, while abnormal conditions happen in the low probability regions [ 37].
In this paper, when the predicted residuals are out of the 99% conﬁdence interval of the normal
distribution, it counts as one invalid prediction.

Three months of SCADA data from 1 April 2012 to 31 July 2012 are collected when the WTs are
under healthy condition, which are used as the test data of the prediction models. The prediction
error series of ﬁve WT temperature parameters (i.e., gearbox input shaft temperature, gearbox cooling
water temperature, generator bearing atemperature, generator winding U temperature, and main
bearing atemperature) are obtained. The prediction error series of gearbox input shaft temperature
are taken as an example, as shown in Figure 12. Based on the 99% conﬁdence interval of the prediction
error, a total of 209 invalid predictions are detected from the error series of the ﬁve temperature
parameters. Then, a ﬁxed-size time window, which contains data in one hour, is used to collect the
prediction error data when the invalid prediction occurs (seen in Figure 12). A total of 182 groups of
the prediction error series are obtained by using the 1-hour ﬁxed-size time window. It is found that
84.62% (154/182) of the error groups contain one invalid prediction, 14.84% (27/182) of them contain
two invalid predictions, and only 0.55% (1/182) of them contain three invalid predictions. Therefore,
in order to avoid misdiagnosis of the anomalies in component temperature parameters, the anomalies
are detected based on the following criterion: if there are at least three invalid predictions in one hour,

 Three months of SCADA data from 1 April 2012 to 31 July 2012 are collected  when the WTs are 
under healthy condition,  which are used as the test data of the prediction  models. The prediction  
error series of five WT temperature  parameters  (i.e., gearbox input shaft temperature,  gearbox 
cooling water temperature,  generator  bearing a temperature,  generator  winding U temperature,  and 
main bearing a temperature)  are obtained.  The prediction  error series of gearbox input shaft 
temperature  are taken as an example,  as shown in Figure 12. Based on the 99% confidence  interval of 
the prediction  error, a total of 209 invalid predictions  are detected from the error series of the five 
temperature  parameters.  Then, a fixed‐size time window,  which contains data in one hour, is used to 
collect the prediction  error data when the invalid prediction  occurs (seen in Figure 12). A total of 182 
groups of the prediction  error series are obtained  by using the 1‐hour fixed‐size time window.  It is 
found that 84.62% (154/182)  of the error groups contain one invalid prediction,  14.84% (27/182) of 
them contain two invalid predictions,  and only 0.55% (1/182) of them contain three invalid 
predictions.  Therefore,  in order to avoid misdiagnosis  of the anomalies  in component  temperature  
parameters,  the anomalies  are detected based on the following  criterion:  if there are at least three 
invalid predictions  in one hour, the corresponding  parameter  is considered  as abnormal.

A case is used for further explanation.  A WT suffered a sudden breakdown  on 20 July 2012 
because of the severe oxidation  of its carbon brush. Figure 13a,b shows the prediction  results and 
error residuals  of the generator  bearing a temperature  from 8 July 2012 to 10 July 2012. It can be seen 
that the original prediction  model could not realize the efficient prediction.  Thus, it is necessary  to 
adjust the prediction  results according  to the abnormal  level of the component  temperature  
parameters.  One simple and efficient method is to set the mean value of original normal distribution  
of prediction  error as the previous  prediction  error. Based on this, the prediction  results of the above 
case are adjusted  after occurrence  of the parameter  anomaly  (more than three invalid predictions  in 
one hour), as shown in Figure 13c. It can be seen that errors of the adjusted  predictions  (MAE from 
19:30, 10 July to 21:30, 10 July is 1.06 °C) are lower than original errors (MAE from 19:30, 10 July to 
21:30, 10 July is 2.34 °C). The condition  parameter  prediction  results for the other eight WT outages 
are used to further verify the proposed  method. Table 5 compares  the MAE errors for the original 
predictions  and the adjusted  predictions  during the period from the occurrences  of the condition  
parameter  anomaly  to the WT outage. It can be seen that the MAE errors of the adjusted  predictions  
are lower than the original MAE errors, which demonstrates  the effectiveness  of the prediction  
adjustment  method.

A case is used for further explanation. A WT suffered a sudden breakdown on 20 July 2012
because of the severe oxidation of its carbon brush. Figure 13a,b shows the prediction results and
error residuals of the generator bearing atemperature from 8 July 2012 to 10 July 2012. It can be seen
that the original prediction model could not realize the efﬁcient prediction. Thus, it is necessary to
adjust the prediction results according to the abnormal level of the component temperature parameters.
One simple and efﬁcient method is to set the mean value of original normal distribution of prediction
error as the previous prediction error. Based on this, the prediction results of the above case are
adjusted after occurrence of the parameter anomaly (more than three invalid predictions in one hour),
as shown in Figure 13c. It can be seen that errors of the adjusted predictions ( MAE from 19:30, 10 July
to 21:30, 10 July is 1.06C) are lower than original errors ( MAE from 19:30, 10 July to 21:30, 10 July is
2.34C). The condition parameter prediction results for the other eight WT outages are used to further
verify the proposed method. Table 5 compares the MAE errors for the original predictions and the
adjusted predictions during the period from the occurrences of the condition parameter anomaly to the
WT outage. It can be seen that the MAE errors of the adjusted predictions are lower than the original
MAE errors, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the prediction adjustment method.

Based on the prediction adjustment, when the WT is under abnormal condition, the POPR for the

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2016 ,9, 882 13 of 21
where"t 1represents the previous prediction error.
Finally, the POPR for the condition parameter iis calculated as follows:
Fi=N
å
j=1P(vj)Oi(vj) (9)
where Nrepresents the number of the discrete wind speed prediction errors and P(vj) represents the
probability of the wind speed vj.
The POPR for wind speed parameter: The WT outages due to exceedance of the cut-out wind
speed (i.e., 25 m/s for the 10 min average wind speed) of WTs also have a major impact on the wind
power output variability, which should be included in the WT short-term outage model.
Based on the CDF of the wind speed prediction errors, the POPR for wind speed can be
calculated as:
Fi=P(ve>vlim v) =1 FNw(vcut out v) (10)
where veis the prediction error of wind speed; vis the predicted value of wind speed; vcut outis the
cut-out wind speed (i.e., 25 m/s); and FNw() is the CDF of the wind speed prediction error.
5. The Probabilities of the Operation of the Protection Relays for Type 2 Parameters
The POPRs for Type 2 parameters are estimated based on operation principles of the protection
relays. In order to avoid the frequent WT startup or stop, the WT outage protections usually have
a speciﬁed setting time. It means that the protection relay operates only when threshold exceedance
duration of the parameter exceeds the setting time. The setting time is decided by the WT producers
and wind farm operators, which is usually less than 1 min. The POPR will increase with the increase of
threshold exceedance duration. However, it is difﬁcult to obtain the threshold exceedance probability
density function by statistics technology due to the lack of outage data. In this paper, the linear
function is used to describe the relationship between the POPR and the duration of parameter threshold
exceedance. The instantaneous data of Type 2 parameters are used for POPR prediction. The POPR for
the Type 2 parameters can be calculated as follows:
Fi=8
>><
>>:1 t<tlim
t/tlim 0<t<tlim
0 t0(11)
where tis the threshold exceedance duration of the parameter and tlimis the setting time. Since the
setting time for the protection relays of Type 2 parameters is short, the time interval of the POPR
prediction is also short, usually within 1 min.
6. Procedure for Predicting the Short-Term Wind T urbine Outage Probability
Following the discussion in the previous sections, a procedure for dealing with the short-term WT
outage probability prediction is established, as shown in Figure 14. The procedure can be summarized
into the following two steps:
Step 1 (Prediction model development): The wind speed prediction model is developed and the
probabilities of the predicted wind speeds (i.e., P(vj)) are obtained based on Table 2. The BPNN based
prediction models of component temperature parameters (i.e., Type 1 parameters) are established
based on what was discussed in Section 4.2 and the threshold exceedance probabilities of the Type 1
parameters (i.e., Oi(vj)) are calculated according to (7) and (8).
Step 2 (POPR and WT outage probability calculation): Based on the probabilities of the predicted
wind speeds and the threshold exceedance probabilities at each predicted wind speed, the POPRs for
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

Type 1 parameters are calculated based on (9). The POPRs for Type 2 parameters are obtained by using
(11). Finally, the short-term WT outage probability can be calculated according to (1).

7. Case Study 
7.1. Case 1 
In this case, a WT suffered a breakdown  because the temperature  of generator  bearing b, which 
belongs to the Type 1 parameters,  exceeded  its threshold  value (i.e., 95 °C). The WT stopped at 15:30 
and restarted  at 17:00. Figure 15 shows the time series of wind speed, ambient temperature,  and 
generator  bearing b temperature  from 05:00 to 17:00. It can be seen that wind speed fluctuated  around 
the rated value 11.5 m/s and ambient temperature  kept increasing  within two hours before the WT 
outage. Measured  values of the generator  bearing b temperature  are always higher than the predicted  
values. According  to the proposed  anomaly  detection  method, the temperature  of generator  bearing 
b has been found abnormal.  Therefore,  under the high‐temperature  and high‐wind speed natural 
environment,  it was the continuous  increase of the bearing temperature  that led to the WT outage. 
The data at 15:30 (i.e., the moment of outage) are used to elaborate  the calculation  process of the 
WT outage probability.  The prediction  result of wind speed at this moment is 11.2 m/s by using the 
ARMA model. According  to the probability  of the discrete prediction  error (Table 2), the predicted  
wind speeds and the corresponding  probabilities  can be obtained,  as shown in Table 6. 
For each predicted  wind speed, the generator  bearing b temperature  is predicted  by using the 
wind speed, ambient temperature,  and the previous  generator  bearing b temperature  as input 
parameters  of the prediction  models. In normal condition,  the mean of the prediction  error for 
generator  bearing temperature  b is 0. Because the WT is in abnormal  condition,  the mean of the 
prediction  error should be superimposed  by 2.5 °C on the basis of the previous  prediction  error (i.e., 
the prediction  error at 15:15. The POPR for generator  bearing b temperature  at each predicted  wind 
speed is calculated  according  to (8), as shown in Table 7. Based on the probabilities  of predicted  wind 
speeds (i.e., P(vj) in Table 6) and the parameter  threshold  exceedance  probabilities  at each predicted  
wind speed (i.e., O(vj) in Table 7), the POPR for generator  bearing b temperature  can be obtained  by 
using (9), which is calculated  to be 0.66. Because the POPR for other condition  parameters  are very 
low at this time (i.e., 15:30), based on (1), the WT outage probability  is approximated  to be 0.66. 
Figure 14. Flowchart of the short-term WT outage probability prediction.
7. Case Study
7.1. Case 1
In this case, a WT suffered a breakdown because the temperature of generator bearing b, which
belongs to the Type 1 parameters, exceeded its threshold value (i.e., 95C). The WT stopped at 15:30
and restarted at 17:00. Figure 15 shows the time series of wind speed, ambient temperature, and
generator bearing btemperature from 05:00 to 17:00. It can be seen that wind speed ﬂuctuated around
the rated value 11.5 m/s and ambient temperature kept increasing within two hours before the WT
outage. Measured values of the generator bearing btemperature are always higher than the predicted
values. According to the proposed anomaly detection method, the temperature of generator bearing
bhas been found abnormal. Therefore, under the high-temperature and high-wind speed natural
environment, it was the continuous increase of the bearing temperature that led to the WT outage.
The data at 15:30 (i.e., the moment of outage) are used to elaborate the calculation process of the
WT outage probability. The prediction result of wind speed at this moment is 11.2 m/s by using the
ARMA model. According to the probability of the discrete prediction error (Table 2), the predicted
wind speeds and the corresponding probabilities can be obtained, as shown in Table 6.
For each predicted wind speed, the generator bearing btemperature is predicted by using the wind
speed, ambient temperature, and the previous generator bearing btemperature as input parameters of
the prediction models. In normal condition, the mean of the prediction error for generator bearing
temperature bis 0. Because the WT is in abnormal condition, the mean of the prediction error should
be superimposed by 2.5C on the basis of the previous prediction error (i.e., the prediction error
at 15:15. The POPR for generator bearing btemperature at each predicted wind speed is calculated
according to (8), as shown in Table 7. Based on the probabilities of predicted wind speeds (i.e., P(vj)
in Table 6) and the parameter threshold exceedance probabilities at each predicted wind speed (i.e.,
O(vj) in Table 7), the POPR for generator bearing btemperature can be obtained by using (9), which is
calculated to be 0.66. Because the POPR for other condition parameters are very low at this time (i.e.,
15:30), based on (1), the WT outage probability is approximated to be 0.66.

probability during a period of Dtcan be calculated according to P=1 e Dt[31], whererepresents

the outage rate of a component. Usually, the component outage rate can be considered as the
statistical average outage rate which is used in traditional power system reliability evaluation [ 32].
Since the wind speed has a signiﬁcant impact on the WT short-term operational reliability [ 11], the
WT outage rate varies depending on the wind speed. Figure 16 shows a relationship between the WT
outage rate and wind speed in the studied wind farm. Based on the multiple predicted wind speeds
and the corresponding WT outage rate as shown in Figure 16, the traditional statistic-based method is
modiﬁed and the WT outage probability during Dt(i.e., 15min) can be calculated as follows:

traditional statistic-based method during the period of high wind speed (i.e., from 14:00 to 15:30).

traditional  statistic‐based method during the period of high wind speed (i.e., from 14:00 to 15:30).

outages.

[3], the maximum  limit of wind farm active power variation  within 1 min shall be no more than 3.3 
MW. It is clear that the output power fluctuation  of the wind farm during this period cannot satisfy 
the requirements  of the electrical  power system. If only the fluctuation  of the wind speed is 
considered,  the output power variation  shall be in normal condition.  However,  after the analysis of 
the operation  condition  of each WT during this period, it is found that many WTs repeatedly  started

reliability  of the WTs at high wind speed is one of the major reasons for the fierce fluctuation  of

The setting time of yaw angle error protection relay is 1 min and the POPR is calculated every
10 s, as show in Figure 19. It is noticed that, when the WT is stopped (as shown in the grey part
of Figure 18), the POPR is set to be 0. At 15 and 56 min, the threshold exceedance duration of the
yaw angle error keeps raising and ﬁnally exceeds the setting time of protection. The yaw angle error
exceeded the threshold value twice at 32 min without the protection relay operation because the
threshold exceedance duration is shorter than the setting time (i.e., 1 min). Since other condition
parameters did not exceed their threshold values, the WT outage probability is equal to the POPR
for yaw angle error. It is proved that the proposed method is able to effectively estimate the WT
outage probabilities.

7.3. Case 3
Figure 20 shows the output power and power variation of the studied wind farm from 18 July to
25 July 2012. It can be seen that the wind farm output power showed a ﬁerce ﬂuctuation at constantly
high wind speed on 21 July 2012, with the maximum of 9 MW. However, according to the Chinese
national standard “Technical Regulations of Wind Power Integration on Electrical Power System” [ 3],
the maximum limit of wind farm active power variation within 1 min shall be no more than 3.3 MW.
It is clear that the output power ﬂuctuation of the wind farm during this period cannot satisfy the
requirements of the electrical power system. If only the ﬂuctuation of the wind speed is considered,
the output power variation shall be in normal condition. However, after the analysis of the operation
condition of each WT during this period, it is found that many WTs repeatedly started and stopped
during this period due to the threshold exceedance of condition parameters. The low reliability of the
WTs at high wind speed is one of the major reasons for the ﬁerce ﬂuctuation of output power of the
whole wind farm.
A WT is taken as an example for the outage probability analysis. This WT stopped nine times
from 11:00, 21 July to 06:00, 22 July due to the threshold exceedance of the gearbox oil temperature.

Figure 21 shows the time series of the gearbox oil temperature, where the time points of the WT
outages are marked. The WT outage probabilities during this period are obtained by using the
proposed outage model. The calculation process is similar to Case 1 and the results are shown in
Figure 22. Compared with the prediction results of outage probabilities only in consideration of
the statistical information, the proposed outage model can accurately predict the short-term outage
probability of the WT. If the wind farm operators could predict the short-term outage probability of
each WT and formulate the proper power generation schedules, the reliability of the wind farm can be
improved. The proposed short-term WT outage model is helpful for the safe and economical operation
of the wind farms and the electrical power systems.

8. Conclusions
This paper presents a novel approach for short-term WT outage probability prediction.
The conclusions of the study can be summarized as follows:
(1) The BPNN based prediction models are established for the WT component temperature
parameters. The test results show that although the prediction accuracy of each component
temperature is different, the maximum of MAE is lower than 1C.
(2) The component temperature prediction models cannot realize the efﬁcient prediction when the
WT is under abnormal condition. The proposed prediction adjustment method could effectively
decrease the prediction errors when the WT is abnormal.
(3) A novel approach is proposed to calculate the short-term WT outage probability by considering
the threshold exceedance of the SCADA condition parameters. Three case studies for an onshore
wind farm in northern China have been carried out and analyzed, which demonstrates the
effectiveness of the short-term WT outage model.
(4) Since the traditional statistic-based reliability evaluation method fails to consider the WT outage
risks caused by the threshold exceedance of WT condition parameters, the proposed method is
more accurate than the statistic-based method.
(5) The WT outages could impact on the power output variation of a wind farm. The prediction results
of short-term WT probabilities are useful for the wind farm operators to estimate the potential
wind power loss due to the WT outages and formulate proper power generation schedules.
Since the proposed short-term WT outage model has not been used in wind farms, there is
still a lack of actual WT outage cases to support a statistical analysis to show how much the WT
outage probability can be reduced by using the proposed method. In future research we will focus
on enhancing the applicability of the proposed short-term WT outage model in large wind farms.
Furthermore, active power control strategies of wind farms based on the short-term WT outage
probability prediction will be investigated. The condition based maintenance strategies with respect to
different WT faults, also deserve further study.
