ABSTRACT
The inverter is one of the key components of wind turbine, and it is a complex circuit composed of a series of
components such as a variety of electronic components and power devices. Therefore, it is dif ﬁcult to accurately
identify the operation states of inverter and some problems regarding its own circuit, especially in the early stages
of failure. However, if the inverter temperature prediction model can be established, the early states can be iden-
tiﬁed through the judgment of the output temperature. Accordingly, considering whether the inverter heats up
normally from the perspective of heat dissipation, a method for the early operation state identi ﬁcation of the
inverter is provided in this paper. A variable selection method based on fusion analysis of correlation and physicalrelationship is adopted to extract variables as input variables, which have high correlation with inverter tempera-
ture. Then multi-input and multi-output temperature prediction model of inverter is established based on a non-
linear autoregressive exogenous model (NARX) network, and the prediction temperature residual is used as the
real-time standard to evaluate the inverter states. For validating this, the validity and reliability of the established
temperature prediction model are veri ﬁed through case analysis, and the performance comparison with various
models demonstrates that the proposed method has higher accuracy. The construction method of the prediction
model can be used for reference to other aspects of wind turbine. All these bring huge bene ﬁts to wind energy
industry.

1 Introduction
The inverter is the hub connecting the generator and the power grid, which is mainly composed of two
inverters with the same structure: the machine-side inverter realizes three-phase recti ﬁcation and converts the
AC voltage on the machine side into the DC voltage on the DC coupling capacitor; the inverter realizes the
inversion and converts the DC voltage into AC voltage with the same frequency as the grid voltage [ 1].
Therefore, as one of the key components of the wind turbine (WT), the reliability level of inverter
directly affects the safety of the entire WT and the power grid.
Since the 1990s, in order to promote the rapid development of wind power integration, a series of wind
power development support policies have been launched. Up to now, the life of large-scale operation WT has

more than half. As an important part of its energy conversion, the components of the inverter system present
different degrees of aging, which is easy to cause imperceptible security risks in serious cases, it even causes
electrical ﬁre. In order to eliminate the hidden trouble ahead of time, reduce the loss of fault shutdown and the
maintenance cost, improve the effective utilization of equipment, and ensure the safe, stable and economic
operation of WT, it is necessary to master the real-time operation status of inverter.
However, the electronic control system is more independent and compact, so unless it is redesigned, it is
not easy to add additional sensors and data acquisition units, and the monitoring system should not interfere
with the normal operation of the electronic control system [ 2]. The SCADA system provides a good
application basis for using the temperature prediction model to predict the operation status of inverter.
Currently, the research work aiming at inverter is mainly carried out on the modular design of inverters,
IGBT thermal balance analysis, performance evaluation, control strategy of cooler, and inverter fault
diagnosis [ 3–9]. A newly developed dual bi-directional IGBT-based inverter in conjunction with
autonomous microgrid system is investigated with particular focus on the thermal management and
performance evaluation under various operation conditions in [ 10], so the inverter is usually equipped
with the ventilation and cooling system. The statistical data presented in [ 11] shows that almost 60% of
failures are caused by temperature cycling. In order to detect such failures, accurate elector-thermal
models are essential. Proper thermal models with heat coupling effect analysis were considered in [ 12],
and it studied a thermal impedance matrix that was convenient for thermal coupling effect estimations
and representing actual heat path through the device. Generally, almost all these researches are linked tocondition monitoring, fault diagnosis and thermal balance analysis of inverter. The understanding of WT
inverter has been deepened via the above research works. However, WT inverter is a complex circuit
system composed of many electronic components, and its working process is also rather complicated.
Hence, it is dif ﬁcult to accurately identify the operation states of inverter and some problems regarding its
own circuit, especially in the early stages of failure.
WT usually equips with SCADA system during the actual operation. Through collecting the data of key
components in WT, the operation status of WT can be mastered, and remote control can be carried out in the
case of necessary. There have been many relevant researches based on the SCADA data, such as WT power
curve calculation, operating state evaluation, identi ﬁcation of abnormal states and fault diagnosis, fault
identi ﬁcation and vibration analysis, etc. [ 13–15]. For example, WT gearbox was monitored through
analyzing lube oil and bearing temperature data in [ 4]. Ageing assessment of WT over time by
interpreting wind farm SCADA data in [ 11]. However, SCADA data are not ideal for conducting a full
condition monitoring of WT due to their low sampling frequency as mentioned in [ 16]. On the contrary,
SCADA data are more suitable to be applied to investigate of the status prediction because the huge data
volume contain all the operating conditions of WT, which can provide abundant training samples when a
prediction model is used for state prediction of WT.
Therefore, it has become a research hotspot to analyze the big data provided by SCADA system and how
to realize the operation status identi ﬁcation and prediction of key components of WT. At present, the related
researches mainly focus on the state prediction of key components such as wind turbine gearbox [ 17],
generator [ 18], pitch system [ 19] by using SCADA data, mainly using long-short term memory (LSTM)
[20], support vector machine [ 21], arti ﬁcial neural network [ 22] and other methods, rarely involving
complex electrical equipment such as inverter. The regression prediction model of wind turbine active
power is establishes based on support vector regression (SVR) algorithm, and realizes the early predictionof wind turbine pitch system fault through the model prediction residual in [ 23]. Neural networks are
used to establish prediction models of the WT condition parameters in [ 24]. However, the above
researches do not consider the relationship between the operation parameters of WTs, and directly use
part of the SCADA data, which makes the accuracy and sensitivity of fault prediction insuf ﬁcient.288 EE, 2022, vol.119, no.1

Monitoring data is essentially a multivariable time series, and there are complex dynamic spatiotemporal
correlation characteristics among different variables, which are often easily affected by strong noise and
random interference and dif ﬁcult to mine. Therefore, on the basis of in-depth analysis of the
characteristics of multivariable SCADA data, it is necessary to further explore and study the robust
multivariable time series deep learning modeling technology, so as to realize the ef ﬁcient fusion of multi-
source heterogeneous monitoring information and the intrinsic eigenstructure feature mining and
extraction. Furthermore, there is a wide variety of methods to build a prediction model, such as neural
network prediction model and multiple linear regression prediction model, and so on [ 25,26].
Nevertheless, prediction values of continuous variables with a related prediction model are based onhistorical data in inverter temperature time series prediction. Accuracy and rationality are extremely
crucial for selecting a prediction method. Hence, many researches have been conducted to improve the
effectiveness of time series models [ 27–30].
For the above problems, this paper aims at large direct-drive wind turbines, and provides a method for
early operation state identi ﬁcation of the inverter by concerning whether the inverter generates heat normally
from the perspective of heat dissipation. The proposed method combines with wind farm SCADA data for
monitoring the status of WT inverter, and uses temperature predictive analysis to study the status of wind
turbine inverters, where multi-input and multi-output temperature prediction model of inverter is
established based on a NARX (Non-linear Autoregressive Exogenous model) network for multi-step-
ahead temperature prediction for the inverter. Furthermore, the performance comparison with other
prediction methods studied extensively at present such as BP (Back Propagation) neural network, linear
neural network, NIO (nonlinear input-output) neural network and NAR (Nonlinear Auto Regressive)
neural network demonstrates that the proposed method has higher accuracy.
The remaining part is organized as follows. In Section 2 , working environment and functional structure
of direct drive WT and the inverter are addressed and analyzed. The data types of the SCADA system are
categorized, and the in ﬂuencing factors of inverter temperature are analyzed in Section 3 . Next, in
Section 4 , the detailed investigation for inverter temperature prediction is carried out, including predictive
model establishment and prediction result analysis. Then in Section 5 , based on the SCADA data, a case
was taken to predict the inverter temperature. Lastly, the main conclusions and future issues for further
investigation are given in Section 6 . All in all, the inverter state prediction and SCADA system are
organically combined, in this paper, to establish a temperature prediction model based on NARXnetwork, so as to identify the status of inverter, which can more effectively provide the operation and
maintenance personnel with planned maintenance decision information, and also provide a theoretical
basis for the thermal management of WT inverter.
2 Analysis of Inverter Working Environment
The typical three-leaf horizontal axis structure of direct drive WT as depicted in Fig. 1 , comprises the
wind rotor, Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSG), inverter and controller, which is one of the
mainstream wind farm models. Affected by time-varying wind speed, PMSG rotor speed is also time-varying, which means the output AC frequency of the generator is unstable. Therefore, it is necessary to
connect the generator and the power grid through a full-scale frequency converter system to control
PMSG rotor speed and the power ﬂowing to the power grid.EE, 2022, vol.119, no.1 289
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
As illustrated in Fig. 1 , the full-scale frequency converter consists of two voltage source converters in the
form of back-to-back, which is located at the bottom of the wind turbine tower. In the generator-side inverter,the three-phase recti ﬁcation is realized, and the AC voltage is converted to the DC voltage. In the grid-side
inverter, the DC voltage is converted into the AC voltage with the same frequency as the grid voltage. In
other words, the voltage and current output by the PMSG will be input to the inverter, it is after being
inverted and recti ﬁed by the inverter that they can meet the speci ﬁc frequency required by the power grid.
During the inversion and recti ﬁcation process, the inverter will generate a lot of heat due to the high heat
dissipation of high-power electrical components inside the inverter cabinet. In particular, the hub speed
changes with the random wind speed, it causes the inverter is always in the operation state. When WT
reaches the rated power under full wind speed conditions, the heat generated by the inverter is also the
largest. WT inverter systems are usually equipped with ventilation and cooling devices, especially large
WTs. However, when the inverter generates heat abnormally, the ventilation and cooling devices are not
sufﬁcient to reduce the inverter temperature to the normal range. Therefore, the temperature in the
inverter control cabinet will also be abnormal.
3 Analysis of In ﬂuencing Factors of Inverter Temperature
Wind farms are usually equipped with a SCADA system, which acquires and records the operation data
of WT and its core components in real time. In this paper, the turbines considered are PMSG WTs from a
wind farm in Chenzhou, China. The wind farm SCADA system can provide two types of data, including
sampled per second (sampling frequency: 1 Hz) and sampled per ten-minute (the ten-minute data
averaged based on the one-second data). There are 55 sensor data, and the remaining 94 data arecalculation data, setting parameters, and state quantities. All these parameters are important to ensure the
safety and ef ﬁcient operation of the turbines. In general, the temperature sensors of the WT inverter are
installed in the inverter cabinet (one at each of the inlet and the outlet), which can better re ﬂect the
temperature status of the inverter. However, inverter temperature has different correlations with other
parameter variables. Some of SCADA parameters have high correlations with inverter temperature, such
as power and current, while some have low correlations with it. Therefore, it is very crucial to analyzePMSGWindWind rotor

and extract which parameters can affect inverter temperature from such multitudes of SCADA parameters.
Next, this paper will explain the in ﬂuencing factors of inverter temperature through correlation analysis and
physical relationship analysis.
Table 1 illustrates the correlation coef ﬁcients between some SCADA parameters in this research due to
space limitations. Table 2 describes the degree of correlation between the two variables. As illustrated in
Table 2 , the larger value of the correlation between two variables means the stronger correlation between them.
Fig. 2 shows the parameter extraction steps. 55 SCADA parameters are divided into 5 categories. The
ﬁrst category has 18 sets of parameters, including some parameters related to the power of WTs, such as hub
speed, generator current, voltage and so on. The second category has 24 sets of parameters, which are the
monitoring temperature of WT main components and the external environment temperature, such as the
main bearing temperature, the generator rotor temperature, and so on. The third category has
5 parameters, mainly affecting the heat dissipation performance of the inverter. The fourth category is
inverter operating parameters, which mainly includes 6 parameters. The last category is vibration
parameters, mainly used to monitor the nacelle vibration. From the correlation analysis of SCADA
parameters shown in Tables 1 and2, there are nearly 20 SCADA parameters have strong correlations
with inverter temperature such as hub speed, wind speed, power, and inverter operating frequency. Some
are negatively related to inverter temperature, such as ambient temperature and so on.Table 1: Correlation coef ﬁcient of SCADA parameter

If more than 20 parameters are used as the input of the inverter temperature prediction model at the same
time, it will not only inevitably bring about information redundancy and increase the dif ﬁculty of
constructing the prediction model, but also even affect the accuracy of the prediction model. In fact, the
correlation coef ﬁcient between hub speed and power is close to 1, indicating that the two are basically
linearly related. Therefore, only the in ﬂuence of power on inverter temperature needs to be considered.
According to the relationship, the methods of correlation analysis and physical relationship analysis are
used to successfully extract 4 parameters that are closely related to the inverter temperature from the
55 SCADA parameters in this paper.
Fig. 3 shows the SCADA data in 1.8 h for a WT including the rotor speed, generator power, wind speed,
inlet temperature of inverter, outlet temperature of inverter, inlet pressure of inverter, outlet pressure of
inverter, ambient temperature, and nacelle temperature.
Through polynomial curve ﬁtting for each signal, in Fig. 3 inverter temperature changes correspondingly
with the change of the rotor speed, generator power, wind speed, inlet pressure of inverter, and outlet pressure
of inverter. Speci ﬁcally, rotor speed, generator power, wind speed, inlet temperature of inverter, outlet
temperature of inverter, inlet pressure of inverter, and outlet pressure of inverter have the same trend.
While, the inlet temperature of inverter and outlet temperature of inverter have different trend with the
ambient temperature and nacelle temperature. The main reason for this difference is that the analysis time
is short and the inverter is not in the nacelle of WT. These indicate that though there is a difference
between the measured inlet and outlet temperature of inverter and the actual temperature of inverter, the
measured inlet and outlet temperature of inverter have the potential to re ﬂect the actual inverter temperature.SCADA parameter pool,

4 The Establishment of the Inverter Temperature Prediction Model
4.1 Inverter Temperature Prediction Model Construction Process
InSection 3 , SCADA parameters that may affect inverter temperature have been analyzed. Next, the
inverter temperature prediction model will be established to identify the inverter status in this section. In
this paper, a non-linear autoregressive exogenous model (NARX) network [ 31] is proposed for multi-
step-ahead temperature prediction for the inverter. NARX network is a nonlinear autoregressive model
which has exogenous inputs, and can learn to predict one time series given past values of the same time
series, the feedback input, and another time series. The network parameters that need to be set mainly
include: the number of input layer delays, feedback layer delays and hidden layer sizes.
The performance of the prediction model is very important. However, as a complex electromechanical
system, the factors affecting WT inverter temperature, especially the relationship between the temperatureand other operation parameters are very complicated. In fact, not all of SCADA parameters are truly
useful for conducting the inverter temperature prediction model. In order to improve accuracy of
prediction, the appropriate input parameters and training sample should be selected. The useful SCADA
parameters will be identi ﬁedﬁrst from these data. Then, the training sample of inverter temperature
prediction model will be designed based on the identi ﬁed SCADA parameters speci ﬁcally. Therefore,
when training a prediction model, the following factors should be considered:
/C15Selection of input parameters
/C15Training data selection rules
/C15Optimal hidden Sizes Row vector

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
/C15Optimal feedback Delays Row vector
In addition, the NARX network has various advantages over other types of recurrent neural networks in
terms of network learning and generalization capability, so missing individual one-second data has no effect
on the model through this method. But the one-second data cannot be used when training the model. There
are two main reasons: (1) The amount of one-second data is very large. There are 86,400 sets of data in one
day, which is very dif ﬁcult to train the model. Training a NARX model with such large training samples will
take a lot of time and even cause the computer system to crash, (2) If a small amount of one-second data is
selected as the training sample, such as 20,000 sets of data, the model training time will be greatly reduced,
which may not be able to simulate all the operation conditions of WT inverter and lead to the very poor
performance of the prediction model. For the ten-minute data, there are only more than 52,000 sets of
data for a wind turbine in a year, and all the power generation conditions will basically appear. However,
ten-minute data is a relatively long-time scale. After the data within ten min is averaged, a lot of valuable
information may be overwhelmed, and it may not necessarily truly re ﬂect the real-time inverter status.
Meanwhile the effect of thermal inertia will be very weak. A new data type which is averaged per 30 s is
provided here, and the 30-s data are averaged based on one-second data, it is de ﬁned as (1):
xnt¼1
30X30
i¼1xi (1)
Because a problem of data collection could cause the value of one or several consecutive data is zero, the
training data with long-term zero power cannot be selected. However, NARX network has a certain
generalization ability, thus the in ﬂuence of individual outliers can be ignored. Based on the above
analysis, the structure of the inverter temperature prediction model based on NARX network is shown in
Fig. 4 .

Firstly, all the power generation conditions of WT are included as much as possible during selecting the
training sample. The training sample would include 6 regions [ 32] and the shutdown situation. In Region 1,
although the wind rotor rotates, the generator power is zero. Region 2 is the transition period of Regions 1 and
3 where the relationship between the torque and the rotational speed of the wind rotor is linear. In Region 3 the
maximum power coef ﬁcient remains constant because the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) is
implemented in this region. Regions 4 and 5 are the transition periods of Regions 3 and 6. Region 6 is the
constant power region where the generator power is limited to 2 MW (rated power). Secondly, the optimal
input delays, optimal output delays, and optimal hidden layers can be set, as shown in [ 33]. And then,
train and test the prediction model repeatedly. Because the residuals are different during each time theprediction model training, there is even a great difference. In order to reduce this randomness, a total of
20 prediction models are trained, and all prediction models are tested. The one with the smallest prediction
residual is selected as the ﬁnal prediction model to verify the effectiveness of the prediction results.
Finally, the prediction set in SCADA database is used to analyze the prediction model residuals.
4.2 Inverter Temperature Prediction
According to implementation steps described in Section 4.1 , once the entry variables have been de ﬁned,
the hidden layer also will be de ﬁned, the reason is that in most practical problems it is not necessary to
include more, and ﬁnally the data are normalized between 0 and 1 [ 34]. Many simulations are performed
using the NARX model varying: the number of delays of the entry variables from 6 to 50, the number of
hidden neurons from 16 to 50, and always using a neuron more than in the entry layer. The network with
the best performance considering the mean square error (MSE) of the test set is the one de ﬁned by
36 delays and 32 neurons in the hidden layer. For the generation of the neural network models,
40,000 sets of 30-s SCADA data are employed to train the neural network models. The division of the
data in the sample used is as follows: 70% for the training set, 15% for the validation set, and 15% for
the test set. These amounts are chosen based on previous rules, which is more convenient to train a
neural network model with the best performance.
Fig. 5 shows the comparison between the real data and predication data with NARX. 40,000 sets
SCADA data used to train the neural network model are shown in Figs. 5a and5b.Fig. 5a shows
the comparison of inlet temperature between the real data and predication data, and Fig. 5b shows the
comparison of outlet temperature. The other 20,000 sets SCADA data are speci ﬁcally used to test the
performance of the model in Figs. 5c and5d. The performance of the model is shown as these ﬁgures.
However, due to the large amount of SCADA data, a signi ﬁcant difference cannot be perceived. To fully
appreciate the prediction model performance, the prediction residuals were plotted and the results are shown
inFig. 6 . Only by using prediction error measurements can this difference be highlighted. Moreover, the
criterion for judging the degree of the prediction residual outliers is the model standard prediction
absolute value percentile, that is, after the training of the prediction model is completed, all training
samples are input to the model, and the absolute value of the model prediction residual is statistically
obtained percentile [ 29].
It is not dif ﬁcult to see from Fig. 6 that the training error and prediction error of the inverter inlet
temperature both are within 1°C, while the training error of the inverter outlet temperature is within 2°C,
and the prediction error is within 3°C. The percentiles of absolute predicted residuals are shown in Fig. 7 ,
where it is not dif ﬁcult to see that during the model training, the percentiles of the training error of the
inverter inlet temperature within 0.5°C is 0.99, and the percentiles of the prediction error within 0.5°C is
0.96; The training error of the outlet temperature is slightly larger than the training error of the inlet
temperature, the percentiles within 1°C is 0.98, and the prediction error within 1°C is 0.84. The resultsdemonstrate that the forecast with the NARX model is feasible. It can be observed that even with the
other SCADA data, the model continues to behave in an outstanding way.EE, 2022, vol.119, no.1 295
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
In order to verify the great performance of the proposed model in temperature prediction accuracy,
several prediction algorithms have been compared with NARX network. It can be seen from Table 3 that
NARX has the smallest MSE of training (MSET) and MSE of prediction (MSEP) and the best accuracy

for inlet and outlet temperature prediction. Obviously, the NARX neural network used in this paper has the
best accuracy for prediction after data selection, determination of input-output variables, which is compared
with BP (Back Propagation) neural network, linear neural network, NIO (nonlinear input-output) neural
network and NAR (Nonlinear Auto Regressive) neural network neural network. The four prediction
methods selected as comparisons in this paper are both traditional and proven effective models. By
comparing with their predictions under the same trade-off indicator, the value and effectiveness of the
work of this paper can be visually displayed.
5 Case Analysis
Finally, a section of measured abnormal data is taken as an example for illustration. SCADA data on
October 28 to 29 are shown in Fig. 8 , which can explain the real-time inverter status. Figs. 8a and8care
respectively employed to analyze the comparison of inlet temperature and outlet temperature of inverter.
To identify the real-time inverter status, Figs. 8b and8dare respectively corresponding forecasted outputs
error of the inverter inlet temperature and the inverter outlet temperature. Generally, the highest operationenvironment temperature of the inverter is lower than 50°C. If the temperature is too high, the inverter
will be easily aged and accelerated the damage. As illustrated in Fig. 8 , for the ﬁrst 1,600 sets, the
prediction error of the inlet temperature and outlet temperature of the inverter remained within a relatively
normal range, and then began to increase signi ﬁcantly, indicating that the inverter status has changed
signiﬁcantly. If the prediction residuals of the temperature at the inlet and outlet of the inverter is larger,
the inverter status needs special attention. When it about reaches 4,200 sets, the prediction error returns to
the normal range.Table 3: Comparison of various model prediction results

6 Conclusions and Future
Inverter status is an important indicator for the safe operation of the WTs. Combining with wind farm
SCADA data, this paper establishes a multi-input and multi-output temperature prediction model based on
NARX neural network, in order to study the multi-step-ahead temperature prediction for WT inverter. The
predicted residual error is obtained to determine the real-time service status of the inverter. Main conclusions
are drawn as follows:
(1) The inverter temperature which can represent the operation state of the inverter is selected as the
output of the model. Based on the fusion analysis of correlation and physical relationship, four
parameters closely related to the output are selected as the input of the model from 55 SCADA
parameters;
(2) Considering the optimal input model parameters (including input layer node, output layer node and
delay layer node), the temperature prediction model of WT inverter is established based on NARX
network and SCADA data, and the predicted temperature residual is used as the real-time index to
evaluate the inverter status;
(3) The analysis of an example shows that the proposed method can effectively identify the operation
state of WT inverter, which can more effectively provide the operation and maintenancepersonnel with planned maintenance decision information, and also provide the practical bene ﬁts
for energy companies and the energy market policy-makers.
In the future, by establishing prediction model of WTs inverter, more intensive investigation conclusions
will be obtained. In order to clearly present the implied information on the health condition of WTs contained
in the model prediction residuals, a new kind of health index from inverter temperature should be developed,
which can effectively re ﬂect some early health problems of WTs to provide a reference for their scienti ﬁc
maintenance. All these new investigation achievements will be reported in separate papers.
