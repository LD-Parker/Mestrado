Abstract: Fault diagnosis and forecasting contribute signiﬁcantly to the reduction of operating and
maintenance associated costs, as well as to improve the resilience of wind turbine systems. Di erent
from the existing fault diagnosis approaches using monitored vibration and acoustic data from
the auxiliary equipment, this research presents a novel fault diagnosis and forecasting approach
underpinned by a support vector regression model using data obtained by the supervisory control
and data acquisition system (SCADA) of wind turbines (WT). To operate, the extraction of fault
diagnosis features is conducted by measuring SCADA parameters. After that, conﬁdence intervals are
set up to guide the fault diagnosis implemented by the support vector regression (SVR) model. With
the employment of conﬁdence intervals as the performance indicators, an SVR-based fault detecting
approach is then developed. Based on the WT SCADA data and the SVR model, a fault diagnosis
strategy for large-scale doubly-fed wind turbine systems is investigated. A case study including
a one-year monitoring SCADA data collected from a wind farm in Southern China is employed
to validate the proposed methodology and demonstrate how it works. Results indicate that the
proposed strategy can support the troubleshooting of wind turbine systems with high precision and
eective response.

1. Introduction
With environmental concerns of fossil-fuel-based energy consumption, renewable energy has been
playing a predominant role in clean and cost-e cient energy production, contributing signiﬁcantly to
the sustainability of human society. One of these renewable energy sources is the large-scale wind
turbines with a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG), which have been widely installed attributing
to their low lifecycle costs. In a DFIG wind turbine system, the gearbox plays an important role in
the drive train of a wind turbine. However, due to the variable heavy load from turbulent wind
and other uncertain factors, gears usually su er unbalanced and varying loads, which results in
dramatic temperature rising and viscosity reduction in the lubricant. As a result, gears might be

gradually deteriorated. These faults take the responsibility of unexpected system breakdown and
extra expenditures on turbine maintenance [ 1]. Therefore, fault diagnosis and forecasting are of
great importance to the resilience of turbine systems and reduction of maintenance costs. Over the
years, a signiﬁcant body of studies has been conducted targeting the troubleshooting of wind turbine
systems. Chen et al. proposed an empirical wavelet transform method for fault diagnosis in wind
turbine generator bearing fault diagnosis and found that this method can enhance performance in
the weak feature detection of wind turbine drivetrain [ 2]. Biswal et al. utilized vibration analysis for
wind turbine fault diagnosis and conclude that the fault size for gear root cracks could be identiﬁed
successfully [ 3]. Moreover, Zhang et al. employed acoustic emission signals for wind turbine gearbox
fault diagnosis, as expected, found that the locations of faults can then be determined [ 4]. The literature
review indicates that most of those fault diagnosis methods are based on vibration and acoustic signals,
however, vibration signals monitored with additional vibration sensors and equipment will result
in extra investment on maintenance, as well as the increase of computational load and di culty in
signal processing.
As to the fault detection and prediction of key components in turbines, recent advances in sensors
and signal processing have been contributing signiﬁcantly to the monitoring and prognosis of WT
gearboxes. However, accurate fault detection and reliable diagnosis in wind turbine gearboxes are still
challenging due to the inherited complexities in mechanical systems and operation conditions [ 5]. Thus,
more accurate and cost-e cient online monitoring is of essential importance on troubleshooting and
enhancement of turbine system resilience. An e ective condition monitoring might either evaluates
component health conditions or helps with the detection and prediction of marginal changes that
indicate incipient faults [ 6]. The WT SCADA system with key parameters can be easily measured
and monitored, including bearing and lubricant temperatures, rotor speed, environment temperature,
and active power. Besides, it can continuously record the historical and present status of a wind
turbine system.
The literature review also shows some successful studies in predicting faults caused by complex
nonlinearity reasons using operational SCADA data combined with diverse approaches such as adaptive
neuron-fuzzy interference systems (ANFIS), Bayesian Networks and Deep Learning Networks [ 7–9].
A hybrid stochastic technique is proposed in reference [ 10], which is based on an augmented observer
combined with Eigen structure assignment for the parameterization and the genetic algorithm (GA)
optimization to address the attenuation of uncertainty mostly generated by disturbances. Data mining
techniques are also applied to this data combination to model the power curve [ 11]. The results of
reference [ 12] demonstrate that the proposed method can e ectively analyze nonlinear data trends,
continuously monitor the WT and reliably detect abnormal problems by using six process parameters.
An exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control chart was proposed in reference [ 13]
and used in Statistical Process Control to determine if the process is out of control. Wang et al. also
presented a deep auto-encoder (DAE) method for anomaly detection and fault analysis of wind turbine
components [ 14]. Although some successful applications have been achieved, the limitations of the
mentioned approaches cannot be overlooked. Firstly, it is di cult to process and interpret a large body
of data collected from the SCADA system simultaneously. Secondly, conventional artiﬁcial intelligent
techniques are ine cient in the extraction of features from raw data [ 15]. Thirdly, the potential of the
SCADA data might have not been fully explored [ 16]. In this study, an algorithmic-level online WT
fault detection method based on SCADA data using support vector regression (SVR) is proposed. The
employed SVR algorithm, which is based on statistical learning and structural risk minimization is a
nonlinear generalization of the Generalized Portrait algorithm developed in 1964 [17,18].
In light of the above, this research is established with the following operations. Firstly, in the case
of decreasing structural risk, SVR can maximally excavate the implicit classiﬁcation knowledge in the
SCADA data. Secondly, as the number of faulty samples is relatively smaller compared with the number
of right samples, SVR can address the imbalanced data issue. Thirdly, SVR can address the nonlinear
system in fault diagnosis. In the developed SVR approach, SCADA data will be preprocessed and

divided into two groups. The ﬁrst group termed as “Training Data” is used to obtain the optimization
function with the “soft margin”, which allows some “  insensitive loss ”. The second group termed
as “Test Data” is then employed to validate the model performance. Once the measured data exceeds
the conﬁdential range, a developing fault then can be spotted.
To present the proposed methodology in a logic manner, the rest of this paper is organized as
follows: the developed methodology is introduced in Section 2, followed by the statistic control
methods demonstrated. Section 3 is focused on the development of an SVR model for wind turbine
gearbox systems using 45 SCADA parameters. After that, a case study is employed to demonstrate
and validate the established system in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 draws to concluding remarks and
recommendations for future studies.
2. Methodology
Support vector machines (SVM), known as a kind of learning machine underpinned by the
statistical learning theory, were ﬁrstly proposed by Vapnik et al. [ 19]. Support vector regression (SVR)
is a machine learning algorithm based on the principle of structural risk minimization is a common
application form of SVMs. The SVR is a powerful function approximation technique of outstanding
generalization performance, which can be used to obtain globally optimal solutions, as well as map a
nonlinear regression problem into a linear regression problem by applying a kernel function. SCADA
monitoring provides a series dataset including bearing and lubricant temperatures, rotor speed and
active power. Compared to the condition monitoring based on vibration and acoustic signals, SCADA
monitoring independent of additional sensors and previous fault datasets. However, raw SCADA data
acquired from wind turbines requires precise mathematical modeling. And the mathematical model is
sensitive to external disturbance. In addition, accurate modeling requires speciﬁcation parameters and
prior data under abnormal working conditions, which limited the application in diverse gearboxes
under variable working conditions. Therefore, an SVR algorithm is developed in the research to
explore the ability of self-study and disposal of complex nonlinearity. Moreover, only standardized
real-time SCADA data is used in the construction of the SVR model to reduce the impacts of external
disturbances. The methodology and framework of this study can be shown in Figure 1.

2.1. Support Vector Regression
SVM is a machine learning tool widely used in classiﬁcation and regression analysis. The SVM
regression is known as a nonparametric technique since it relies on kernel functions. Compared to
other existing fault detection methods, the SVM is specialized in address problems with small sample
size, nonlinear and high-dimensional datasets. Moreover, with the introduction of soft margin, the
generalization ability of SVM is signiﬁcantly enhanced. The initial design of SVM is to map the
input vectors(x1,y1),,(xl,yl)	XRinto a higher dimensional feature space. Then the linear
regression in this high dimensional space will be solved. The input space is deﬁned by Kernel functions

[21].
Given the training data(x1,y1),,(xl,yl)	XR, where ldenotes the total numbers of data
andxidemonstrate the values of independent variables or training data in this study. yiis the output
whileXdenotes the space of the input patterns (e.g., X Rd), one objective of this research is to ﬁnd a
function f(x)that has at most "deviation from the actually obtained targets yifor all the training data,
and at the same time to set it as ﬂat as possible. One of these functions is the Gaussian kernel, with the
maximum tolerance of the deviation between f(x)and yis. By introducing a dual set of variables,
the function then can be expressed as:

2.2. Statistic Control Methods
In order to identify if the wind turbine is working in normal, the statistic control method is applied
to the time series of sample data. Mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum of the data are
collected within control limits. There are several rules to determine whether the data is out of control
limits. In this study, the normal distribution was applied for the wind turbine SCADA data. Here,
the normal distribution set up by central limit theorem as the distribution to which the mean value of
almost any set of independent and randomly generated variables rapidly converges is an important
class of statistical distributions.
The probability density function of the normal distribution is given as:
f(x)=1

whereis the mean or expectation of the distribution, is the standard deviation and 2is the
variance. Di erent values of andwould produce di erent normal density curves and di erent
normal distributions. The normal density can be speciﬁed by means of an equation. The probability
distribution of a random variable xis identiﬁed to be normal if it has a probability density. Figure 2
shows the changes in the normal distribution with the standard deviation. As shown in Figure 2,
68% of the data falls in [  ,+] standard deviation of the average, 95% of the data is within
[ 2,+2] the standard deviations of the average, while 99.7% of the data falls in [  3,+3]
the standard deviations of the average. If the data is within [  3,+3], the process will be

identiﬁed as working in normal. However, once the data goes beyond the control limits [  3,+3],
the process will be considered as out of control, and then faults are detected.

SVR is a detection algorithm based on statistical learning theory. The initial design of this 
algorithm is to minimize error, individualize the hyperplane and set a margin of tolerance. Analysis 
of the SCADA data in this study found that the values of parameters such as bearing temperature,

where 𝜎 is a given constant. One significant advantage of using Gaussian kernel is the possibility of 
operating in infinite dimension space, which results in that the feature space is easier to handle due 
to the linearity in feature space. Three of the parameters can be adjusted for setting an SVR with the Gaussian kernel, namely, 𝐶, 𝜀, and 𝜎. The SVR performance has a heavy dependence on the triplet 
of parameters. The parameter selection aligns with the value selection of the decision variables 𝐶, 𝜀,

sets is measured by the sliding window N with N is further divided into 5 elements. After that, the optimal model parameters are obtained by using the fivefold cross-validation. Finally, the optimal model is used in online fault detection. In a 50% cross-validation, 40% of the sample is used for training and 10% of the sample is used for testing.

To address this concern, grid search is adopted in the scheme. Regarding the optimizations of the

functioned with an exhaustive parameter optimization method. The SVR model will perform optimally
only in the case those parameters have been selected properly. The grid search is based on a deﬁned

3.3. Gearbox Faults Detection Methods and Residual Control 
In order to detect the incipient faults of gearbo xes, warning and alarming limits need to be set. 
In the normal working condition, the residual of  detected data and the online real-time data fall 
within the control limits [ 𝜇−3 𝜎 ,𝜇+3 𝜎 ]. However, when the wind turbine suffers from sudden 
uneven loads, the residual could deviate from the normal working sp ace. The significant changes in 
the estimated residual could result in a varied dist ribution of the mean value and standard deviation. 
As this sudden change would not appear as a trend in time series, thus, once the estimated residual of the data keeping increase and step out of  the thresholds, a faul t is then identified. 
In the proposed model, one year of monitoring data was collected as a baseline to perform a 
validation of normal dist ribution. The mean value 𝜇 and the standard deviation 𝜎 of the residual 
value, as well as the estimated re sidual value, is then used Equation  (17) to support troubleshooting. 
In this formula, with the mean value-centered, [ 𝜇−𝜎 ,𝜇+𝜎 ] employed as the warning limits while 
[𝜇−3 𝜎 ,𝜇+3 𝜎 ] will play as the alarming limits.

3.4. Gearbox Temperature SVR Model Residual Statistic Analysis
In wind turbine SCADA systems, the bearing temperature and the lubricant temperature of
gearboxes are recorded with an interval of two seconds, which helps real-time monitoring and fault
detection. When the wind turbine gearboxes experienced unexpected faults, the recorded vector in the
normal working space would be updated. This would result in a signiﬁcant change in the residual of
the predicted data and real-time data. The mean value and the standard deviation indicated that the
distribution of the residual would be abnormal. To detect the changes of parameters in the time series,
a moving average calculation is then applied. For a given period, the residual sequence of gearbox
temperature from the SVR model can be expressed as
"T=["1,"2,,"N,] (19)
A time window of width N is used to calculate the moving average or mean, as well as the
standard deviation for the N consecutive residuals in the window.
X"=1
NNX
i=1" (20)
S"=vut

N 1NX
i=1
"i X"2(21)
In normal conditions, the residual mean value should be around zero, and the standard deviation
should be with a constant value. As mentioned above, gearbox faults can be identiﬁed when the
residual mean value and standard deviation start to deviate. Speciﬁcally, in the ﬁrst situation, the
residual mean value remains zero, but the standard deviation steps out of the lower and upper
boundary. However, in the second situation, the residual mean value varies signiﬁcantly, while the
standard deviation remains relatively constant. In the third situation, both the residual mean value
and the standard value deviate signiﬁcantly.
4. Case Study and Discussions
In this section, a one-year SCADA dataset of the WT from a wind farm located in Southern China
has been employed for the validation of the proposed methodology. The framework of the studied
wind turbine system is shown as Figure 4, which consists of blades, a multi-stage gearbox, a DFIG,
and a frequency converter and control unit. The gearbox is driven by blades to spin the generator to
electricity production. The stator of the DFIG converts the mechanical energy with high-speed rotation
into power output via the gearbox. Wind turbine faults are found mostly from key elements such as

the gearbox, blades, and the generator. These faults are usually associated with high maintenance costs
and long downtime of turbine systems. Therefore, troubleshooting and e cient fault identiﬁcation of
gearboxes are of great signiﬁcance to reduce the lifecycle expenditures on wind turbines, as well as to
increase productivities of wind farms.

4.1. Structure of the Wind Turbine Gearbox and the SCADA System 
Large-scale wind turbine systems are developed fo r wind energy harvesting in remote regions, 
where strong winds are available. The turbine nacelle is sitting on top of a tower which is usually 
more than 80meters (m) in height. Figure 4 illustrates the major components of a typical utility-scale 
wind turbine drivetrain, which is composed of main bearing, main shaft, gearbox, brake, generator shaft, and generator. The generator converts the mechanical energy with high speed to power energy. The blades and rotor hub are supported by main bearings. 
The SCADA system at the wind farm records all wind turbine parameters with a frequency of 
two seconds. Each record includes a timestamp, output power, stator current and voltage, wind speed, environmental and nacelle temperatures, as we ll as the generator stator winding and cooling 
air temperatures [18]. Indeed, there are 34 variables in total including internal parameters such as 
bearing and lubricant temperatures, as well as exte rnal parameters like environmental temperature 
obtained from the SCADA systems in stalled at the wind farm. In which the lubricant temperature 
will be sampled with a resolution of two seconds. These data will be preprocessed through data normalization before analysis. At the same time, the SCADA system keeps a recording of turbine operating and fault information such as startup, shutdown, generator over temperature and pitch system fault. Each fault record is  composed of a timestamp, a state number, and the fault information.

From the wind turbine SCADA datasets, the 34 systematic features listed in Table 1 can be

algorithm which then leads to the performance enhanc ement in the machine learning process. In this 
study, features were calibrated with a linear function, which ensures the values of each feature in data unit-variance. We use the normalization to av oid overweight that certain features of different

4.3. Results and Discussions 
With the establishment of the temperature de tection model and the processing of all the 
monitoring data, th e WT gearbox working conditio ns can then be analyzed. 
(1) Normal Operation Conditions of Gearboxes 
Figure 7 shows the predicted and actual operating temperatures of the gearbox lubricant and 
bearing. Although there are numerical differences between the measured and estimated values, they 
present consistency in value changes, or it can be concluded that they are of the same tendency in 
value variations. Figure 8 is further employed to fin d errors in the values of residuals. The diagram 
indicated that the results detected by the SVM model  are desirable when the gearbox is working in 
normal conditions. With the intervals [ 𝜇−2 𝜎 ,𝜇+2 𝜎 ] and [ 𝜇−3 𝜎 ,𝜇+3 𝜎 ] are established as warning 
limit and alarming limit respectively (shown as threshold 1 and threshold 2 respectively in Figure 8, 
most values fall in within the thresholds, which indicates that the gearbox was working in normal 
conditions. In this study,  mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), 
mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are employed to measure  the 
accuracy of the model.  RMSE is an estimator that can measure the deviation between the observed 
value and the real value. While the mean absolute MAE is a measure of the difference between two 
continuous variables that can be used to reflect the accuracy of the model. MAPE considering both 
the error between the true value and the predicted va lue, and the ratio between the error and the true 
value, thus, it supports a good eval uation of the stability of the model. In Figure 7, the MAPE, RMSE, 
MAE are 0.4572, 0.3500, and 0.0074, respectively.
