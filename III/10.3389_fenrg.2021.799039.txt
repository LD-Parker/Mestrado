Wind turbines are widely installed as the new source of cleaner energy production.
Dynamic and random stress imposed on the generator bearing of a wind turbine maylead to overheating and failure. In this paper, a data-driven approach for conditionmonitoring of generator bearings using temporal temperature data is presented. Fouralgorithms, the support vector regression machine, neural network, extreme learningmachine, and the deep belief network are applied to model the bearing behavior.Comparative analysis of the models has demonstrated that the deep belief network ismost accurate. It has been observed that the bearing failure is preceded by a change in theprediction error of bearing temperature. An exponentially-weighted moving average(EWMA) control chart is deployed to trend the error. Then a binary vector containingthe abnormal errors and the normal residuals are generated for classifying failures. LS-SVMbased classi ﬁcation models are developed to classify the fault bearings and the normal
ones. The proposed approach has been validated with the data collected from 11 windturbines.

1 INTRODUCTION
Wind energy is the fastest growing form of renewable energy. Continuous operations in all
environmental conditions contribute to failures of wind turbine components, assemblies, andsystems. The generator of a wind turbine is one of the most failure-prone assemblies due to thevariable loads ( Kusiak and Verma, 2012 ). Bearing failures account for more than 40% of the overall
wind turbine generator failures leading to unexpected energy losses ( Tavner et al., 2012 ). Hence, a
solution for effective condition monitoring of generator bearings and early identi ﬁcation of failure
symptoms is needed.
Deteriorating performance of a generator bearing manifests itself on abnormal changes of the
vibration signal, torque, and bearing temperature ( Yang et al., 2017 ;Feng et al., 2020 ). Vibration
analysis and data-driven approaches have been applied for condition monitoring of generatorbearings ( Yang et al., 2018 ). The frequently used classical vibration analysis approaches include
Fourier transformation ( Klein et al., 2001 ), wavelet transform ( Yan et al., 2014 ), Hilbert-Huang
transform ( Peng et al., 2005 ;Huang and Wu 2008 ), and empirical model decomposition (EMD)
(Huang et al., 2008 ). Other models have been developed. Teng et al. (2016) utilized a complexEdited by:

Gaussian wavelet to obtain the multi-scale enveloping
spectrogram for extracting weak features. Lei et al. (2013)
applied an ant colony algorithm to form adaptive stochasticresonance method for failure detection. Peeters et al. (2018)
integrated automated spectru m editing procedure, band-pass
ﬁltering and envelop analysis to detect bearing failures based
on the vibration signal. Vibration analysis approaches arevaluable in monitoring and diagnosis of generator bearingfailures. However, high frequency data from multiplevibration sensors is needed to perform such analysis.However, at present high frequency data is not availablefrom industrial turbines due to the excessive cost and datasharing practices.
Most commercial wind turbines are equipped with the
supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems
collecting data that can be used to model behavior of
generator bearings. Kusiak and Verma. (2012) applied a
neural network to model bearing temperature for failureprediction and identi ﬁcation. Guo. (2012) introduced
nonlinear state estimate tech nique (NSET) for temperature-
based failure detection. Yang et al. (2013) applied correlation
analysis and quantitative assessment based on the SCADAdata. The published literature indicates that the data-drivenmethods provide robust bearing monitoring solutions forwind turbines.
Deep learning is a recent addition to the modeling suite
with promising applications in multiple domains ( Ouyang
et al., 2017 ;Sun et al., 2020a ;Sun et al., 2020b ;Shen et al.,
2021a ;He et al., 2018 ;Li et al., 2018 ). The deep learning
algorithms are capable of extracting in-depth features andpatterns within the training dataset ( Gritsenko et al., 2017 ;
Ouyang et al., 2019 ;Li et al., 2020 ;Shen et al., 2021b ;Shen and
Raksincharoensak 2021 ). Within the wind energy sector, it
has been applied in the prediction tasks of wind speed ( Hu
et al., 2016 ), wind power ( Wang et al., 2017 ), and wind
direction ( Wang et al., 2016a ;Li et al., 2021a ). Extensive
research has also been published using the deep-learning
approaches: Wang et al. (2016b) developed deep auto-
encoders to compress the time-series SCADA dataset andthe blade breakages are extracted from the deep-learnedfeatures. Yang et al. (2018) applied stacked Restricted
Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) to capture the system-widepatterns and then performed condition monitoring withpromising results. Bach-Andersen et al. (2018) selected 1-
dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNN) to extracttemporal features to classify failures of gearbox bearings.Overall, deep-learning algorithms support development ofhigher complexity models.
In this research, a deep-learning approach is explored to
monitor generator bearings. A deep belief network (DBN)integrated with back-propagation (B-P) ﬁne-tuning and layer-
wise training is developed to model normal generator bearingtemperature using SCADA data. Four data-driven modelspredicting normal bearing temperature are constructed.Their performance is assessed with the absolute percentageerror (APE), the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) andthe root mean square error (RMSE). The analysis of industrialSCADA data indicates that that bearing failure is preceded by
the error shift. The exponentially weighted moving average(EWMA) control chart is applied to monitor the error shift. Atemporal binary vector is generated in real-time, and a ﬁnal
failure classi ﬁcation model is developed. The bene ﬁts of the
proposed approach are demonstrated with computationalexperiments.
2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
The use of deep-learning algorithms in prediction andcondition monitoring is growing ( LeCun et al., 2015 ). Deep
learning originates from the research in neural networks.
Deep-learning algorithms avoid the local optima dilemmaand contains superior power in extracting globally robustfeatures from the dataset ( Deng and Yu 2013 ;Qiu et al., 2017 ).
2.1 Deep Belief Network
In this research, a deep belief network (DBN) is applied to model
the generator bearing temperature. Proposed by Hinton et al.
(2006) , the classical DBN algorithm multilayers of restricted
Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and a logistic regression layer(Wang et al., 2016c ).
The restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a commonly used
generative stochastic neural network ( Hinton et al., 2006 ). It
includes a visible layer of binary-valued neurons and a hiddenlayer of Boolean neurons (see Figure 1 ). The connection between
the hidden layer and the visible layer is bidirectional and
symmetrical. There are no inter-connections between neuronsin the same layer.
Training a single restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM)
involves the weight matrix between the two layers. Theconﬁguration of weight matrix is based on the energy function
expressed in Eq. 1 (Wang et al., 2016c ). The joint distribution of a
visible layer vector and the hidden layer vector is expressed in Eq.
2(Hinton et al., 2006 ). The activation functions of neurons in the
visible and hidden layer are presented in Eqs 3 ,4(Hinton et al.,
2006

number of Boolean neurons within the hidden layer; wj,iis the

sigmoid function. Hence, the weight matrix and the layer biases
are obtained in a layer-wise unsupervised pre-training described
in the Section 2.2 .
2.2 Layer-wise Pre-training
A deep belief network (DBN) includes multiple layers of
restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) ( Ouyang et al., 2019 ).
Figure 2 shows the architecture of the proposed DBN. The ﬁrst
RBM of the DBN model consisting of a visible and a hidden layer(hidden layer 1) is pre-trained as an independent RBM. Then,
the weight matrix of the ﬁrst RBM is computed. The output of
theﬁrst RBM becomes the input to the second RBM that
includes two layers. The ﬁrst layer (hidden layer 1) is treated
as a visible layer of the second RBM while the secondlayer (hidden layer 2) is treated as the hidden layer. Theweight matrix of the second RBM is computed. Hence, theweight matrices between the remaining hidden layers areobtained iteratively.
Training each restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is
accomplished with a stochastic gradient descent method(Hinton et al., 2006 ). Based on vector Eq. 2 of the joint
distribution function between the visible and hidden layer, the
objective function of the stochastic gradient descend method isexpressed in Eq. 5 (Wang et al., 2016c ).L(a, b, w )/equals/summationdisplaylogP(v, h), (5)
where: a is the bias vector of the visible layer; b is the bias vector of

6–8. The updating rules are formulated in Eqs 9 –11(Hinton
et al., 2006 ).

2.3 Data-Driven Algorithms
Performance of the deep belief network (DBN) is compared
with three algorithms, support vector regression machine(SVR), neural network (NN), and extreme learningmachine (ELM).
The support vector regression machine (SVR) is considered in
this study includes a Gaussian kernel function ( Drucker et al.,
1997 ). The values of the model parameters (c and γ) are selected
based on the 10-fold cross-validation. The neural network (NN)contains two hidden layers. By testing on a small portion of thetraining data, the sigmoid activation function is selected based onthe satisfactory performance. The extreme learning machine(ELM) algorithm ( Liang et al., 2006 ) is utilized to model the
normal bearing temperature. As a single-hidden layer feed-forward network, the ELM learning model is expressed in Eqs
12,13(Liang et al., 2006 ).

2.4 Performance Evaluation Metrics
To assess prediction accuracy of the deep belief network, three
performance evaluation metrics are computed: the absolutepercentage error (APE) Eq. 14 , the mean absolute percentage
error (MAPE) Eq. 15 , and the root mean square error (RMSE)
Eq. 16 .

2.5 Exponentially Weighted Moving Average
Control Chart
The increasing value of the prediction bearing temperature error
of a data-driven model re ﬂects deterioration of the generator
bearing conditions. In this research, an exponentially weightedmoving average (EWMA) ( Jones et al., 2001 ) control chart is
applied to monitor the error. The weighted average of the pastbearing temperatures reduces the noise and allows detecting smallprocess shifts.
To compute the upper and lower con ﬁdence limits of the
EWMA control chart, the EWMA
tis obtained from Eq. 17
(Wang et al., 2016b ). The upper and lower con ﬁdence limits
can be computed from Eqs 18 ,19(Horng Shiau and Ya-Chen
2005 ).

According to Horng Shiau and Ya-Chen. (2005) , the value of the

2.6 Binary Vectors Generated by Control
Chart
The EWMA control charts used statistical thresholds to label the
prediction error (residuals) as normal and abnormal. The normalresidual usually denotes the bearing temperature is within thenormal range and the wind turbine is at healthy status. On theother hand, the abnormal values often indicate abnormal bearing
temperature change and it can be the warning signal for bearing
failures. Hence, in this research, the normal and abnormalresiduals identi ﬁed by the EWMA control charts are
transformed into binary vectors as described in Figure 3 as
follows.
According to Figure 3 , the statistical thresholds classi ﬁed the
residuals into normal and abnormal ones. Each data point can besimply labeled as 0 (normal) and 1 (abnormal). Hence, the binaryvectors can be generated in real-time and be utilized as theinputs for the ﬁnal classi ﬁcation models introduced in the
Section 2.7 .
2.7 Classi ﬁcation Models
Using the real-time vectors generated by the EWMA control
charts, the ﬁnal failure classi ﬁcation models are constructed in
this research. Here, the dimension of the input vector isdetermined as 20 which represents all normal/abnormalprediction residuals of bearing temperatures. In total of fourstate-of-art machine learning algorithms including supportvector machine (SVM), least-square support vector machine(LS-SVM), extreme learning machine (ELM), and kernel-basedextreme learning machine (KELM) are selected to classify thevectors representing generator bearing failures and vectors from
normal bearing behaviors.
The SVM is the state-of-art supervised learning algorithm
used for classi ﬁcation and function approximation ( Cherkassky
and Ma, 2004 ). It is based on kernel functions and it avoids the
difﬁculty of using linear functions in the high dimensional
parameter space, and the optimization problem is transformedinto a dual convex quadratic programming problem.
The LS-SVM is developed based on statistical theory and
considered as the improved version of SVM ( Zhu et al., 2018 ).
Compared with the vanilla SVM, the LS-SVM modi ﬁes the
inequality constraint in the SVM to the equality constraint.
Meanwhile, the training error square is used to replace the
slack variable in order to transform quadratic programmingproblem into the linear equation problem for greatlyimproving the speed and accuracy of model parameters. The

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
LS-SVM has the unique superiority in dealing with the small-
sample learning problem.
The ELM is a feedforward neural network which contains the
input layer, the output layer and one single hidden layer.Compared with other computationally expensive and time-consuming neural networks, the ELM adopts Penn Moorepseudo inverse to determine the weights and biases betweenthe hidden layer and output layer ( Li et al., 2021b ). This
method enables ELM to learn faster and attain highergeneralization capability compared with other neural networks.
The KELM uses the kernel method over the vanilla ELM and it
solves the problem of random initialization of ELM and has highclassi ﬁcation accuracy ( Pandey et al., 2018 ;Ouyang 2021 ), good
generalization ability and high degree of robustness. TheGaussian kernel function is the most frequently used kernelfunction and thus is selected in this study.
3 COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS
The data used in this research has been collected from SCADAsystems of a large wind farm. The data 10 min resolution datafrom 11 wind turbines is used to investigate failure of a generatorbearing. Two bearing failure instances have been reported duringthe period covered by the dataset.
3.1 Dataset Description and Preprocessing
The ranges of the generator bearing temperature of the 11turbines are provided in Table 1 . The bearing failure incidents
are also included in Table 1 . Based on the maintenance records,
Turbine B, H, I, and K have been affected by bearing failures and
are not considered for modeling normal bearing behaviordiscussed in the Section 3.2 . Rather they are selected to test
abnormal behavior of the bearing temperature.
3.2 Parameter Selection
To capture the normal behavior of a generator bearing, 33parameters relevant to the bearing temperature have beeninitially considered. Using domain expertise, the number ofparameters of interest was reduced to 12. Next, threealgorithms (i.e., the wrapper with genetic search (WGS)(Kohavi and John, 1997 ), boosting-tree algorithm (BTA)
(Sbihi, 2007 ), and the relief algorithm (RA) ( Liu et al., 2018 )
were applied to select the most relevant parameters for predictingthe generator bearing temperature. The wrapper approach uses
supervised learning to perform 10-fold cross validation in
selecting relevant parameters. The boosting-tree algorithmevaluates the importance of parameters by constructing asequence of decision trees and computing the predictionresiduals. The relief algorithm selects the parameter set bydetecting conditional dependence between the parameters. Theeight most important parameters selected by the three data-mining algorithms are listed in Table 2 .
3.3 Modeling Bearing Behavior
Data from three wind turbines (i.e., Turbine C, Turbine D,
Turbine E) have been merged to train the neural network,
support vector regression machine, the extreme-learningmachine presented in Section 2.2 , and the proposed deep
belief network (DBN). Data collected from Turbine A, B, Fand G are used as validation dataset to validate predictionperformance of the proposed DBN algorithm. Data fromTurbine G, J, I and K are used as testing dataset respectively.To design the DBN, the number of hidden neurons in each layeris set at 10% of the training data ( Mitchell, 1999 ). The data from
the remaining 2 healthy turbines (i.e., Turbine 9 and 11) aredesignated as test datasets to evaluate performance of the four
algorithms.
Table 3 presents prediction results produced by the four
algorithms based for the test and validation datasets. Themean absolute percentage error ( MAPE ) and the root mean
square errors ( RMSE ) produced by the DBN algorithm are the
smallest which con ﬁrms the accuracy of the DBN model. This
superior performance may be attributed to the layer-wise pre-training.
Figure 4 illustrates prediction error from testing and
validation produced by the deep belief network (DBN). TheAPEs of healthy wind turbines and turbines with bearing
failures demonstrate different behaviors. Hence, the
emerging bearing failure is indicated by the APE of the
DBN model.
3.4 Condition Monitoring
In this section, behavior of the prediction error associated withthe bearing failure is discussed. The APE was monitored forTABLE 1 | Dataset description.

1 week prior to the bearing failure. The upper con ﬁdence
limit (UCL) and the lower con ﬁdence limit (LCL) of the
exponentially-weighted moving average (EWMA) controlchart are computed from Eqs 18 ,19ofSection 2.4 .
The monitored examples of healthy turbines and theturbines with emerging bearing failures are illustrated inFigures 5 ,6.
Figure 5 illustrates the EWMA charts of healthy
turbines (Turbine G and J) while Figure 6 shows the wind
turbines (Turbine I and K) with problematic generator
bearings of the same wind farm. In Figure 5 ,a l ls t a t i s t i c s
fall within the control limits which indicates normal bearingbehavior. Meanwhile, outliers in Figure 6 begin to emerge1 week prior to the bearing failure and an early alarm is
issued. According to the results presented in Figure 6 ,
bearing failures are visible several days ahead ofthe occurrence. The proposed approach providessufﬁcient time to react and thus minimize power loss and
downtime.
The outcomes of the EWMAs are transformed into the real-
time binary vectors and then the bearing failure classi ﬁcation
models are developed to classify the actual failures. However,
in the temporal domain, the optimal size of the EWMA
vectors are uncertain. Hence, this research performed severalexperiments by trying difference size of the EWMA vectors(i.e., K/equals10, 20, 30, 40). All algorithms introduced in the SectionTABLE 3 | Performance evaluation of four algorithms.

As illustrated in Figure 8 below, the ROC curves for the four
state-of-art algorithms are obtained with respect to the testingdataset. Among them, the LS-SVM achieves the highest areaunder the ROC curve (AUC) as 0.88 which demonstrates itssuperior performance in classifying bearing failures from thebinary vector mixed with normal and abnormal predictionresiduals. Meanwhile, the other performance metrics includingaccuracy, sensitivity and speci ﬁcity along with the 95%
conﬁdence intervals are also provided in Table 4 . The LS-
SVM still performs best among all algorithms tested according
to all evaluation metrics. Hence, using the vectors generated fromthe DBN and EWMA control charts, the LS-SVM is capable ofclassify the majority of the bearing failures in the temporaldomain.
4 DISCUSSION
The condition-monitoring framework proposed in this study hasprovided promising results using ﬁeld SCADA data. Overall, the
advantages of the proposed framework can be summarized intothe following three points: First, it uses deep belief network as thebackbone regressor. It has shown superior power in extractingtemporal abnormal features from the dataset. Second, theframework is designed to be implemented on SCADA datawhich is the standard data collection system for almost allwind farms across the globe. Hence, it can be widelyimplemented on practice. Third, the classi ﬁcation part can
save a lor of labor and time. Conventional control chart-based
identi ﬁcation of mechanical failures requires humans to detectthe statistical outliers. Instead, in this research, the machine-
learning classi ﬁers enables the automation of this process. In sum,
it can be widely applied in wind farms for conditionmonitoring tasks.
On the other hand, there are also few shortcomings at
current stage. For example, the sensor errors can be amisleading factor that cause false classi ﬁcation of mechanical
failures. The reliability of the SCADA sensors is not considered inthis framework. This can be a future direction of our current
research.
5 CONCLUSION
In this research, a deep-learning based condition-monitoring
framework to identify bearing failures was presented in thisstudy. Historical data collected from healthy wind turbineswas utilized to develop a model predicting bearing
temperature with a deep belief network. Data from both
healthy wind turbines and turbines to the bearing failures areserved as the testing dataset. Comparative analysis demonstratedthat the deep belief network model was more accurate inpredicting generator bearing failures. An exponentially-weighted moving-average control chart was applied to captureshifts in prediction error. The control charts generated binaryvectors lead to identi ﬁcation of the emerging bearing failure in
real-time in the temporal domain.
Computational results reported in the paper validated
accuracy of the deep-learning framework in condition
monitoring of wind turbine generator bearings. In the future
