1. INTRODUCTION  
Early fault diagnosis reduces machine failure by 75%. Timely fault identification is crucial for 
reliable wind turbine (WT) operation. Fault diagnosis tech is critical in power and energy generation by 
making it more dependable. The marine current turbine' s rotor blade pitch imbalance defect is proposed in 
[1]. Continuous  Morlet wavelet transform and K -nearest neighbour (KNN) machine learning are used to 
classify fault severity in fault diagnosis. MRnet, a novel technique, utilizes photos taken by automated aerial 
vehicles to identify blade defects in WTs. Mask region -based  convolutional neural network (R -CNN) and 
MRnet networks are used for fault detection, segmentation, and classification. proposes a methodology for 
frequency control of microgrids using droop control in the generator -side converter (GSC) with battery 
energ y storage system (BESS) [2]. The spatiotemporal distribution of natural wind speed and the effects of 
wind shear and tower shadow effect are analyzed along with blade mass imbalance fault in DFIG WTs  [3]. 
Frequency spectrum and Lissajous curves are studied and analysed to detect WTs flaws [4]. Zhang et al. [5] 
proposes an image array for recognizing the defect in tur bine blades using a neural network. Finally, it 
diagnoses faults in the field -oriented control of doubly fed induction generators (DFIG) using frequency 
spectrum and Lissajous curves [6].

Han et al . [7] combined the unstable streamlined and WT dynamic models to compute a unique 
response based on beam theory in a typhoon for 6 MW and 2 MW WTs. Meanwhile, Rolán and Pedra [8] 
proposed a calculation to investigate DFIG WT. At the same time [9] highlighted the need for a geographic 
information system and presented an improved condition monitoring system, and [10] used a parameter 
estimation technique and an observer approach to diagnose mechanical drive train faults in WTs.  
The use of the artificial neural network (ANN) in WTs is analyzed [11]. The study outlines the main 
challenges and technology gaps. Another study [12], highlights how an inter -turn short cir cuit (ITSC) fault 
can impact the performance of an induction generator in WTs. The effect of increasing the power converter 
switching frequency of DFIG during fault conditions is investigated [13]. To improve the fault ride -through 
(FRT) capability o f DFIG, the switching frequency control parallel resonance fault current limiter (SFC -
PRFCL) is applied. Additionally, Shohag et al. [14] reviews the various types of damage that WT blades can 
experience and the preventive measures. Lastly, a novel multi -level inverter is developed in [15] to protect 
the DFIG from voltage drops caused by power system issues.  
Zhao et al. [16], discuss WT impeller mass moment computation under five different circumstances. 
Hichem and Tahar [17] presen ts fuzzy logic for fault monitoring and identification. Yang and Chai [18] is a 
review of fault diagnostics research for wind converters. Qiao and Lu [19] presents a comprehensive review 
of condition monitoring and fault identification methods for offshore WTs. Patel and Patel [20] presents a 
complete study on WT's transient stability. Mishra and Shaikh [21] presents a model for simulating steady -
state behaviours of a DFIG.  
The researchers [22]–[24] respectively report on rotor unbalance, acoustic emission detection method, 
and PQ theory for permanent magnet synchronous generators. Kusiak and Verma [25] analyses data -mining 
algorithms using data from a large wind farm. An algorithm is introduced that restructures mass and aerodynamic 
imbalances by [26]. Amirat  et al. [27] describes a tool for detecting bearing issues and the stator current signal.  
DFIG WTs have different faults su ch as gearbox faults, blade imbalance faults, and interturn faults. 
The most common fault is the blade imbalance fault. It is necessary to identify these faults early for the 
reliability of the system. Various techniques are applied to identify these fault s such as KNN, ANN, CNN, 
and MRnet. The power spectral density method and the order tracking analysis method are proposed for 
detecting imbalance faults by analyzing aerodynamic torque [28]. The spatiotemporal distribution of natural 
wind speed and the effects of wind shear and tower shadow effect are analyzed along with blade mass 
imbalance fault in DFIG WTs [3]. 
In this paper, an analysis is done on stator currents of the DFIG WT to identify any blade imbalance 
conditions in the wind farm. The results of spectrum analysis  and the various wavelet decomposition 
components of the signals show the abnormalities of the signal with the blade imbalance fault. Whenever the 
wind speed exceeds its critical limit, the amplitude characteristic frequency I 02(t) is also exceeded. The de fect 
characterization methodology is used to monitor the changes in the magnitude of the characteristic frequency 
I02(t) under the same wind speed condition to identify the severity of impeller imbalance flaws. This analysis is 
carried out with the variabl e wind speed which changes with respect to the real time. To validate the results, 
wavelet analysis is carried out on the flow of the reactive power of DFIG to determine the disturbances in the 
signal during healthy and faulty conditions. A DFIG Simulink m odel with blade imbalance is developed in this 
study using stator current characteristic analysis and its coordinate transformation. Additional stator currents are 
evaluated in comparison to their spectrum. The fault characteristic component of the charact eristic frequency 
magnitude, I 0(t), grows as the wind speed increases. By keeping track of variations in the stator current fault 
characteristic component's characteristic frequency amplitude under the same wind speed conditions, the 
component may accurate ly assess the sternness of the blade imbalance fault.  
 
 
2. DOUBLY FED INDUCTION GENERATOR  
Nowadays modern power electronics converters control the rotor currents in the DFIG to achieve the 
variable speed necessary to maximize energy from the variable wind. Figure 1 depicts the standard non -
uniform velocity WT system with a DFIG. Rotor turbine b lades, a gearbox, a generator, and a power 
electronics converter are the main components of the DFIG machine. Research by Hammouchi et al . [6] 
GSC, DC link, and rotor -side converter (RSC) are the components that make up the power  converter module. 
The common connection is used to couple the stator, GSC, and DFIG to the grid. The dynamic equations of 
DFIG in d -q components applying the Park transformation are given in accordance with the motor sign 
convention and the synchronous re ference frame.

3. MATHEMATICAL MODELLING FOR BLADE IMBALANCE FAILURE’S EFFECT ON THE 
STATOR CURRENT OF A WT  
When a WT has three blades and is run at a fixed angular speed of m (rad/s), the blade imbalance 
fault can be said to be present in terms of shaft torque.  
 
𝑇=𝑇0+𝑇𝑣sin(𝜔𝑚𝑡 +ϕ) (6)

Here  t(s) is time; T (Nm)  is WT shaft, output torque ; T0 (Nm)  is aerodynamic torque ; Tv (Nm)  is fluctuation 
torque due to blade imbalance fault ; and ϕ(rad)  is early phase angle.  
With its wheels, drive shaft, gearbox, and generator rotor, the DFIG transmission mechanism was 
equivalent to a centred mass symbolised by:  
 
2𝐻𝑀𝑑𝜔 𝑚
𝑑𝑡=𝑇−𝑇𝑒− 𝐷𝑀𝜔𝑚 (7) 
 
Here  HM is equivalent inertia time constant ; Te(N·m)  is electromagnetic torque ; and DM, damping 
coefficient~0 , at a steady condition, dω m/dt=0.  
In (6) and (7) , show the electromagnetic torque oscillates at the same frequency as the shaft torque's 
cyclic oscillation. Co nsequently, the electromagnetic torque can be explained as follows when the blade is 
unbalanced:  
 
𝑇𝑒=𝑇𝑒0+𝑇𝑒𝑣sin(𝜔𝑚𝑡 +ϕ) (8) 
 
Here T e0 (Nm)  is electromagnetic torque established by the related aerodynamic torque T 0 (Nm)  and Tev (Nm)  
is electromagnetic torque formed by the equivalent imbalance torque T v (Nm).  
The isq component in the q -axis direction of the stator current can also be used to express the electromagnetic 
torque Te  (Nm):  
 
𝑇𝑒= 3𝑝
2=𝛹𝑠𝑖𝑠𝑞 (9) 
 
Where p  is No. of pole and s(Wb)  is stator winding flux linkages.  
From (10)  can be calculated using the DFIG stator flux orientation model:  
 
𝑑𝛹𝑠𝑑
𝑑𝑡= − 𝑅𝑠𝑖𝑠𝑑+ 𝑢𝑠𝑑  
σ𝐿𝑠𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑑
𝑑𝑡= − 𝐿𝑠𝑅𝑟+ 𝐿𝑟𝑅𝑠
𝑑𝑡 𝑖𝑠𝑑 + 𝑅𝑟𝛹𝑠𝑑
𝐿𝑟 σ𝐿𝑠𝜔𝑠𝑖𝑠𝑞+𝑢𝑠𝑑 (10) 
σ=1− 𝐿𝑚2
𝐿𝑠𝐿𝑟⁄   
 
where s d is stator flux s, d -axis component, i sd is stator current i s, usd is stator voltage u s, R s and R r is stator 
and rotor resistance, respectively, L s and L r is stator and rotor inductance, respectively , Lm is magnetizing 
inductance, and ωs is slip angular velocity.  
To obtain 𝛹𝑠𝑑 in the steady state operation of the WT, we need eliminate the 𝑢𝑠𝑑 in (10).  
 
𝛹𝑠𝑑=𝐿𝑠𝑖𝑠𝑑−σ𝐿𝑟
𝑅𝑟𝐿𝑠𝜔𝑠𝑖𝑠𝑞 (11) 
 
From the stator flux orientation model, the 𝛹𝑠𝑞 that is the q -axis direction component of the stator 
flux 𝛹𝑠 is equal to 0. Thus,  
 
𝛹𝑠=𝛹𝑠𝑑=𝐿𝑠𝑖𝑠𝑑−σ𝐿𝑟
𝑅𝑟𝐿𝑠𝜔𝑠𝑖𝑠𝑞 (12) 
 
In the steady state case, the stator flux 𝛹𝑠 is constant. The periodic oscillation in Te causes the q -axis 
component of stator current 𝑖𝑠𝑞 to have the same vibration frequency. Thus:  
 
𝑖𝑠𝑞=𝑖𝑠𝑞0+ 𝐴𝑠𝑖𝑞sin (𝜔𝑚𝑡+ ϕ𝑞) (13) 
 
Similarly, when combined with the stator flux 𝛹𝑠 expression in (12), the d -axis component of stator current 
𝑖𝑠𝑑 also shows the same vibration frequency, as (14):  
 
𝑖𝑠𝑑=𝑖𝑠𝑑0+ 𝐴𝑠𝑖𝑑sin (𝜔𝑚𝑡+ ϕ𝑞) (14) 
 
In (13) and (14), the stator current components i sq0 and i sd0 are generated by T 0, respectively. A sid and 
Asiq are the amplitudes of the additional stator currents generated by the imbalanced torque T v, which are 
proportional to Tev. ϕd and ϕq are the initial phase angles of the current i sd and i sq, respectively.  
The stator current can be transformed from the dq coordinate system to the abc three -phase coordinate 
system when combined with the dq-abc transformation, the calculated a phase stator current is as (15):

In (16) indicates that the blade imbalance would cause the DFIG stator current to produce a 
harmonic component with frequency fe ± fm (ωe=2 πf e, ωm=2 πfm) (Hz). Although the harmonic 
component can theoretically be utilized to diagnose blade imbalance failur e, the actual fault's effect on the 
harmonic component's amplitude is typically minimal. Thus, base frequency current leakage and outside 
noise can readily drown out the amplitude.  
 
3.1.  Method used for doubly fed induction generators  system analysis  
Spectrum analysis detects errors by identifying changes in the amplitude of the featured frequency 
of the squared signal stator current vector. To extract fault characteristics, a feature extraction technique 
using Park transform, wavelet and spectrum anal ysis is intended. Blade imbalance results in harmonic 
components with a characteristic frequency of fe ± fm in the stator current. Direct spectral analysis cannot 
extract fault characteristics. Coordinate transformation can analyze stator -phase current fau lt characteristics 
successfully at consistent and tempestuous wind velocities. Wavelet and spectrum analysis can diagnose 
blade unbalance. See Figure 3 for the steps.

4. RESULT ANALYSIS  
Utilizing Sim ulink, a DFIG simulation model with per -unit values and a blade imbalance condition 
is created. This model validates the effectiveness of the suggested approach for the stator current fault 
analysis. Park’s transformation methodology is applied to determin e the impeller imbalance faults in the 
DFIG.  
The block diagram model is presented in Figure 4. This block diagram consists of a 3 -phase source, 
a transmission line of 30 km, and a step -down transformer which is directly coupled with the DFIG WT. The 
dq-axis components as well as the fault characteristic component with fm frequency of the DFIG stator 
current can be observed through the scope under the normal and blade imbalance fault conditions.

4.1.  Characteristic analysis of stator -phase current fault  
Direct spectrum analysis on stator current and turbine speed shows that transforming the 3 -phase 
stator current from 3 -d to 2 -d coordinates using Park's transformation can accurately identify fault 
characteristic frequency, even at high wind velocities, and can successfully detect blade :

3𝑖𝑎− √1
6𝑖𝑏−√1
6𝑖𝑐  
 
𝑖𝛽=√1
2𝑖𝑏−√1
2𝑖𝑐  
 
𝐼2(𝑡)=𝑖𝛼 2+𝑖𝛽 2  
 
Park's transformation and the squared signal I2(t) is used to convert the DFIG stator 3 -phase current 
i(t) into two -dimensional space. Park's transformation's main idea is to translate the 3 -phase stator current 
into 2 -D coordinates. Using envelope analysis to obtain the upper and lower envelopes of I2(t). By removing 
the DC component : 
 
𝐼02(𝑡)=𝐼2(𝑡)−[𝐼𝑑𝑢𝑝2(𝑡)+𝐼𝑑𝑜𝑤𝑛2(𝑡)]/2 
 
The frequency of the fault feature amplitude can be determined by doing spectral analysis shown in 
Figure 5. By contrasting the feature frequency amplitude with the variation in the feature frequency 
magnitude during normal action, the savagery of the blade imbalance fault may be assessed.

The char acteristics of DFIG under normal condition is shown in the Figure 6. The 3 -phase p.u. 
voltage at 575  V bus, 3 phase p.u. current through 575  V bus, and flow of real and reactive power shown in

conditions. Further, Figures 6( e)-(h) show DC excitation voltage, rotor speed in p.u., and the 3 phase p.u.

To investigate blade imbalance in a DFIG WT, a fault was simulated by changing the pitch angle of 
the blades at 0.4 seconds. The resulting characteristics are shown in Figure 7. A comparison was made 
between the normal and imbalance conditions. Due to blad e imbalance condition various changes are 
observed in the results are described in Figure 7 .

operates under blade balance conditions.  Further, Figures 7(e) -(h) are shows DC excitation voltage, rotor 
speed in p.u., and the 3 phase p.u. voltage at 25  kV bus, 3 phase p.u. current through 25  kV bus respective ly.

4.3.  Wavelet analysis  
Figures 8 and 9 are display both the original signal and its respective wavelet coefficients. 
Multilevel wavelet decomposition is carrie d out to divide the signal into two components: approximation 
coefficients and detailed coefficients. Single -level wavelet decomposition divides the signal into low -pass 
(approximation) components and high -pass (detailed) components.  After the first level of decomposition, the 
approximation coefficients are obtained and further decomposed to result in second -level approximation 
coefficients (a2) and detailed coefficients (d2). This process is repeated for a total of 5 levels of 
decomposition, resulting in t he coefficients d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, and a5.  
The wavelet analysis was carried out successfully and showed the waveform of the reactive power 
flow in the DFIG under healthy conditions. The waveforms in Figure 8 consist of various components of the 
reactive p ower absorbed by the DFIG, which validates its steady state. Next, the wavelet analysis was carried 
out with a fault introduced at 0.4 seconds. The waveform in Figure 9 shows the flow of reactive power in the 
DFIG with the fault. The various components of the reactive power consumed by the DFIG are shown with 
changes in amplitudes at 0.4 seconds, which validates the faulty state of the DFIG.  To effectively assess the 
severity of the blade imbalance fault, it is expected that fluctuations in the amplitude co mponent of the fault 
characteristic frequency of the stator current will be possible under the same wind speed conditions. 
Therefore, by comparing the variation in the frequency amplitude feature of 𝐼02(𝑡) with that in normal 
operation, it is possible to  measure the severity of the blade imbalance defect .

5. CONCLUSION  
This study analyses stator currents of a DFIG WT to identify blade imbalance conditions in the wind 
farm. The defect characterization methodology monitors the characteristic frequency I 02(t) to identify the 
severity of impeller imbalance flaws in real time, while wavelet analysis validates the results. The proposed 
approach analyses stator current characteristic extracts and diagnoses impeller imbalance failure in both 
steady -state and turbulent wind conditions. This method can accurately assess the severity of the blade 
imbalance fault by tracking variation s in the stator current fault characteristic component's characteristic 
frequency amplitude under the same wind speed conditions.
