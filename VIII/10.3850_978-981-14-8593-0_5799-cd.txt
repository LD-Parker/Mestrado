The offshore wind industry experience a rising importance for the worldwide energy production, which is ac-
companied by increasing amount of wind turbines and Offshore Wind Farms (OWFs). However, due to its harshenvironment and its role for energy provision, OWFs are confronted with several threats that are impacting its safetyand security. Consequently, decision making at design as well as run time plays an important role for providingsafe and secure operation in OWFs. We propose in this work the application of a Bayesian Network (BN) for ahigh-level representation of the safety and security state of an OWF. The developed BN-model is based on the safetyand security goals and related functions deﬁned in K ¨opke et al. (2019). The derived model enables a user to analyze
the overall importance of high impact functions, like compliance, environmental protection, supply reliability oraccident prevention. Obtained results indicate that the proposed BN-model enables decision makers to explore
cross-system interrelations, and thus, to deﬁne requirements for implementations on lower design levels.

1. Introduction
The offshore wind industry provides a reduced
emission form of energy production that is contin-uously gaining importance in the world-wide en-ergy provision with annual growth rates of nearly30% (see O’Sullivan, 2020). In 2019, Europehad a total offshore wind energy production of67 TWh, which corresponds to 2.3% of the totalEU electricity consumption (Komusanac et al.,
2020). This trend also has economic implications,reﬂected by the prediction that by 2030 the off-shore wind power shall be responsible for 8% of
the total ocean economy adding USD 230 billionof value (OECD, 2016).
However, Offshore Wind Farms (OWFs) are
confronted with plenty safety and security threats.This results mainly from its harsh environment,
the considerable complexity as well as its roleas a relevant power generation system. For ex-
ample, failing components are recurring obstaclesin OWFs requiring well-established maintenanceprocesses (Carroll et al., 2016). These processes,though, are prone to further challenges in terms ofsafety and security.
Several works have focused on the employment
of indicators for supporting the assessment ofthe safety level of OWFs. For example, Pfaffelet al. (2019) discuss the application of Key Perfor-mance Indicators (KPIs) for the operational man-agement of offshore and onshore wind turbines.Seyr and Muskulus (2016) analyze safety speciﬁcindicators for OWF and conclude that most ofthe indicators applied today are relevant whencompared to reported incident data. Furthermore,Gonzalez et al. (2017) review KPIs for the op-eration and maintenance of offshore and onshorewind farms.

However, indicator-based solutions are re-
stricted by the vast complexity and multitude of
stakeholders of OWFs. Consequently, only few
works discuss the interrelation between require-ments in terms of safety and security as well aseconomy, environment and compliance with reg-ulations (see for example Aghahowa and Allen,2007). Based on this observation, K ¨opke et al.
chose a different approach by using a functionalmodel (see Section 3 of K ¨opke et al., 2019). The
authors identiﬁed and classiﬁed the main stake-
holder goals in OWFs and employed the Func-
tional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM; Holl-nagel and Goteman, 2004; Hollnagel, 2012) in or-der to represent the correspondent relations. Fur-thermore, the authors integrated a straightforwardprobabilistic model and Monte-Carlo simulationsfor the determination of the functions of OWFsthat are most susceptible to failures.
In this work, we propose an extension of this
model by adopting a Bayesian Network Analysis(BNA), which leads to a more formal approachfor exploring relations within OWFs in terms ofsafety and security. Using the resulting model andwith help of expert knowledge one can determinehow a failing function impact other functions inthis complex system as well as to help to howdesign changes, e.g. the hardening of selected
functions, inﬂuence the system stability.
The rest of this work is structured as follows.
Section 2 reviews the identiﬁed safety and secu-rity goals. Section 3 describes the methodologyadopted in this work. The model is presented onSection 4. The results and implications are dis-cussed in Section 5. Conclusions are summarizedin Section 6.
2. OWF safety and security goals
This section reviews the safety and security goals
in OWFs and discusses a functional model ofOWF presented in previous works.
2.1. Stakeholder perspective
In order to derive safety and security goals, K ¨opke
et al. (2019) identiﬁed stakeholders and their ob-jectives in the ﬁeld of OWFs . Stakeholders are
e.g. owners, operators, work-managers, coast-guards, vessel and air trafﬁc services. The authorscontinued to analyze their tasks and objectives in
the OWF and proceeded to classify their goals in
nine different categories (see Table 1).Table 1. OWF safety and security goals
taken from K ¨opke et al. (2019).
# Safety and security goals
1 Accident prevention
2 Security
3 Compliance4 Occupational safety5 Environmental protection6 Reputation7 Plant safety8 Supply reliability9 Finance
It is important to note that the goals are inter-
related. It means any change in the status of anycategory may have an impact on the others. Forexample, if the surveillance of an OWF is not
sufﬁcient in a way that it leads to an accident.
Then the safety of the plant may most likely be
compromised; namely a change in accident pre-vention decreases the plant safety and may evenaffect security.
Subsequently, K ¨opke et al. focused on ﬁve
safety and security goals, i.e. #1, #2, #4, #5,and #7 (see Table 1). They detailed these ﬁveobjectives in 64 different functions. The functions
are presented in Table 2 where they are organized
in sub-categories, namely: i)detailed safety and
security goals (function #1 to 21), ii)safety and
security measures (function #22 to 53), and iii)
analysis of sensor data (function #54 to 64) (seeT a b l e1o fK ¨opke et al., 2019).
2.2. Probabilistic FRAM model
In K ¨opke et al. (2019), interrelations between
safety and security goals as well as all the func-tions in Table 2 are deﬁned. These relations wereimplemented using a FRAM-model . Based on the
interrelated functions, the authors proceed to carryout a Monte Carlo simulation where each function
had three features, i.e. i)a scalar which repre-
sented the probability to fail, ii)a scalar providing
the time (in days) it takes to restore the functionwhen it got broken, and iii)a factor with which
that particular function may inﬂuence the ones itis related to.
In this work, we are using the FRAM-model in
order to implement the BN-model in Sect. 4. The
failure probabilities given in Table 2 represent the
probability of being false F. Conditional proba-

bilities are derived from these basic failure prob-
abilities inﬂuenced by adjacent functions and therespective factors f(see Sections 3.1 and 4). The
restoration times are not employed as in K ¨opke
et al. (2019), they were only used in their workto carry out the Monte-Carlo simulation. Theprobability of failure phas the values of low (L,
0.005), medium (M, 0.015) and high (H, 0.02).The factor to inﬂuence functions fhas the values
of low (L, 1.05), medium (M, 1.2) and high (H,1.35), as adopted in K ¨opke et al. (2019, see also
Table 2).3. Methodology
This section presents preliminary information re-
garding the theory behind Bayesian Networks aswell as the supporting programming library.
3.1. Bayesian Networks −BNs
BNs are one of the most popular probabilistic
graphical models. Its application are wide andvary from Computer Vision to support of Medi-cal Diagnosis (for some examples see Zhou andHuang, 2006; Luciani et al., 2003). BNs are Di-

Proceedings of the 30th European Safety and Reliability Conference and
the 15th Probabilistic Safety Assessment and Management Conference 1759
rected Acylic Graphs −DAGs−which represent
random variables and their conditional dependen-cies. BNs combine the DAGs with probability
theory to provide practical means for representingand updating probabilities about events of interest.In order to do so, BNs make use of the Bayes rule
for calculation of the posterior estimate.
Lets consider two different variables AandB,
where their probabilities are expressed as P(A)
andP(B), respectively. The conditional proba-
bility P(A|B), following Bayes rule , is given by:
P(A|B)=P(B|A)∗P(A)
P(B)(1)
where in Eq. 1, P(A)is the prior estimate,
P(B)is the marginal probability of B,P(B|A)is
the likelihood, which is the probability of Bgiven
A. Finally, P(A|B)is known as the posterior
distribution, which is the probability of Agiven
B.
The DAG consists of nodes and a set of edges.
As its name suggests, the nodes are directly con-nected. Figure 1 shows an exemplary schematicrepresentation of such a DAG . In this example, one
of the edges goes from AtoC, meaning that Cis
the child of Aand at the same time Ais the parent
ofCandD. In the same way, one can continue
and mention the rest of the sets of parents andchild of the representation shown in this ﬁgure.
In this formulation the nodes can either be in-
dependent or dependent. In Fig. 1 the node Aand
Bare the independent nodes andC,D, and Eare
the dependent nodes . For each dependent node ,
its probability value is provided by a Conditional
Probability Table (CPT) on the parent node(s),
respectively. Such CPT contains one probabilityvalue for every possible combination of child andparent states (Murphy, 2012).
Lets assume a BN with the following structure
(X, E ), where Xrepresents the random variables
X={x
1,x2, ..., x N}of the nodes and Erep-
resents the edges with conditional independentprobabilities between the nodes. The join prob-
ability distribution of this BN with Nnodes has
the following form:
P(X)=N/intersectiondisplay
i=1P(xi|Pa r(xi)) (2)
where in Eq. 2 has been used the chain rule,A B

besides Pa r(xi)denotes the set of parent nodes
of the random variable xi. The nodes outside
Pa r(xi)are conditionally independent of xi.
3.2. Pomegranate
In order to implement our BN-model , we made use
ofpomegranate (Schreiber, 2017), which is a ma-
chine learning package. It has implemented sev-eral probabilistic models; such as: General Mix-ture, Markov Chains, Bayesian Networks, NaiveBayes, etc. Its great advantage is that: (i)it is
an open source package, (b)it works with Python
and its implementation is being done in Cython in
order to speed up the calculations, and iii)it allows
multi-threaded parallel execution so that can han-dle big amount of data. Therefore, Schreiber madepomegranate a versatile tool ready to be applied to
a wide variety of cases.
4. Bayesian Model for safety and
security
This section presents a model that relies on
Bayesian Networks (BNs) and permits the investi-gation of safety and security goals in OWFs. First,we introduce the parametrization of the proba-bilities adopted for the independent nodes , i.e.
discrete distributions, and dependent nodes , i.e.
CPTs. This is followed by the presentation of theimplemented OWF BN-model .
4.1. Parametrization
A common challenge of BNs is the deﬁnition of
the probabilities. If sufﬁcient data are available
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

the 15th Probabilistic Safety Assessment and Management Conference 1760
one can employ e.g. the maximum likelihood
approach Le Cam (1990) or other learning tech-niques. However, for high-level abstractions asconsidered inhere, one has to rely mostly on ex-pert knowledge (Lichte and Wolf, 2019). Here,we make use of expert knowledge provided inSection 2. Table 2 summarizes this knowledge byintroducing the failure probability and the inﬂu-ence factor for each node as described in K ¨opke
et al. (2019).
In our BN approach, the probability Pof a node
Nbeing true Tor false Fdepends on whether the
node is dependent or independent of other nodes.For independent nodes, the probability of failure,i.e.P(N=F), and the probability of functional
as desired, i.e. P(N=T), are given by the
following discrete distribution:
P(N
i=F)=pi (3)
P(Ni=T)=1−pi (4)
where pirefers to the probability of failure of
node Nigiven in Table 2.
For the dependent nodes, probabilities of being
trueTor false Fare given by conditional proba-
bilities, i.e. CPTs, dependent on their parent nodes(see Section 3.1). Assuming that the node N
iis
now a dependent node, it has a set of Mparent
nodes, i.e. Pa r(Ni)={X1,X2, ..., X M}. The
conditional probability of failure for the depen-dent node is given by:
P(N
i=F|Pa r(Ni)) = piM/intersectiondisplay
j=1Fj (5)
where
Fj=/braceleftBigg
1 ifP(Xj=T)
fjotherwise
The factor fjis given along with piin Table 2.
The probability of a dependent node working asdesired is given as:
P(N
i=T|Pa r(Ni)) = 1−P(Ni=F|Pa r(Ni)).
Finally, equations 3-5 are employed to deter-
mine the probabilities used as input values for the
safety and security BN-model of the OWF.
4.2. Generic OWF model
Having the probabilities, we can then proceed to
work out our model based on the interrelationsdeﬁned in the FRAM-model (see Section 2 and
K¨opke et al., 2019).
Figure 2 shows the overall safety and security
model of a generic OWF as directed acylic graph .
In this representation, the sixty-four ( 64) functions
of Table 2 become the nodes and their relations
the edges . The nodes are formed by: ( i) goals,
(ii) measures, and ( iii) analysis of sensor data.
There are in total twenty seven (27) independent
and thirty-seven (37) dependent nodes, respec-
tively. The independent nodes are boldfaced in
the ﬁrst column of Table 1. This model has beenimplemented as a BN-model by using python-
pomegranate (see Section 3.2; Schreiber, 2017).
After all values of the BN-model have been
computed, each node inherits the probability ofP(T)andP(F), which corresponds to the prob-
ability of whether that node is functional or not
a.
That probability, i.e. whether a node is functionalor not, depends on the joint probability. For thedependent nodes , the joint probability is a func-
tion that considers the probabilities of the nodeson its incoming edges and the probability of thenode itself, which is represented via its CPT (seeequation 2 in Section 3.1). For example, in Fig-ure 2, the value of node Avoid Pollutants depends
on the nodes Observe Leakage as well as Observe
Water Quality .
5. Results and Discussions
This Section explores the implemented and pa-
rameterized BN-model and discusses the results.
5.1. Initial State
Figure 3 shows the resulting distribution of P(F)
for each node in the network. Besides, the average
failure probability of the network is
P(F)=
0.008±0.005. As expected, the results are sim-
ilar to the ones reported in K ¨opke et al. (2019).
However, in contrast to what was determined byK¨opke et al., the most susceptible node is Safety
ROV, and not Safety of worker . While the latter
has a probability of failure of P(F)=0 .0153
(node number # 18 in Table 2), the former hasprobability of failure with P(F)=0 .0201 (node
number # 10).
aThe sum of both needs to add up to one, i.e. P(T)+P(F)=
1.

This results mainly from the different way of
carrying out the analysis. While the authors inK¨opke et al. (2019) analyzed the varying failure
rate over time, the inference executed in heredetermines the overall probability.
5.2. V ariations of the initial model
In order to explore the applicability of the de-
veloped model, we modiﬁed the failure proba-bility of the independent nodes and determined
the impact on the model (see Figure 4 for theratios of the new failure probabilities). In de-tail, we decreased the failure probability of thesenodes by 20 % (red stars in Figure 4), while inthe second experiment we increased the failureprobability by 20 % (green triangles). Figure 4adepicts the overall view of the resulting failureprobability. The decreased and increased failureprobabilities of the independent nodes is clearlynoticeable, i.e. the indicators with values of 0.8and 1.2, respectively, while the failure probabilityof the dependent nodes varied only slightly. Theresulting change of these failure probabilities ismore apparent in the zoomed in view shown inFigure 4b.
For example, in the ﬁrst experiment, the prob-
ability of failure of the function Collision avoid-
ance (node number # 26 in Table 2) decreased by
a factor 0.998 as a consequence of the decreasein the failure probability of its incoming functions(node numbers # 27, 28, 43, 44, 56; see alsoFigure 2). In the second experiment, the probabil-ity of failure of the same function (node number# 26) increased by a factor of 1.002, given theincrease of the failure probability of its incomingparameters. Similarly, it can be explained theremaining nodes in the BN-model .
Finally, one can argue that this relatively low
change follows from the low failure probabilityand factor values initially determined by the ex-perts. Nevertheless, these results clearly indicate
the strength of the implemented BN-model .I t
enables decision makers to explore the impactof failure probabilities on the whole system and,based on that, extract requirements for the imple-mentation of each node.

(OWF). The nodes of the model represent the
main functions within an OWF, which can befunctional or not, while the edges mean the corre-spondent relations. Obtained results indicate thatthe developed BN-model enables the exploration
of the interrelations between all functions in termsof failures on high abstraction level, and thus,permits the extractions of requirements for theimplementations of the functionality of an OWF.
