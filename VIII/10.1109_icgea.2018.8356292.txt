Abstract 
The offshore wind energy industry has grown exponen tially; globally, there is 12GW of 
installed capacity of offshore wind, of which over 95% has been installed in the past ten years. 
Access and maintenance in offshore wind farms can b e difficult and considerably more 
expensive than onshore wind farms. Additionally, wi th low availability levels and greater 
downtime due to failures, there is a growing intere st in the optimisation of operation and 
maintenance (O&M) activities to maximise profitabil ity. 
Traditionally, maintenance activities on critical c omponents and subsystems have deployed 
two maintenance approaches; time-based preventative  or corrective. Time-based 
preventative or scheduled maintenance approaches ar e based on intervening at fixed 
intervals, determined in advance for each component .  Scheduling is based on failure statistics 
such as mean time between failures (MTBF), mean tim e to repair (MTTR) or mean time to 
failure (MTTF).  These come either from publicly av ailable databases or operational 
measurements. As part of preventive maintenance act ivities, there are annual services of the 
turbine to replace and maintain any component or as sembly based on manufacturers’ 
indications. On the other hand, the corrective main tenance approach involves operating 
equipment until it fails and then restoring it, rep airing it, or replacing it.  
Due to conservative estimates regarding the probabi lity of failure, preventive and corrective 
maintenance approaches have financial implications associated with them. In the preventive 
approach, components are frequently replaced before  they reach the end of their working 
life. In contrast, corrective maintenance guarantee s that the serviceable life of a component 
is maximised, but it is subjected to long downtime,  which is expensive regarding energy 
generation loss. Additionally, failure of the compo nent may cause consequential damage to 
other parts of the wind turbine system, resulting i n even greater repair costs, downtime and 
loss of revenue.  
A comprehensive literature review has been undertak en in the areas of maintenance, turbine 
reliability, turbine failure modes and causes, phys ics of failure, condition monitoring 
techniques, and costs.  The limitations and disadva ntages of current operation and 
maintenance practices are identified, and new appro aches combining the knowledge of the 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
4 condition of components and historical data are pro posed and compared to achieve optimal 
turbine availability and maintenance cost reduction .  
A Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) was per formed for the functional modes of each 
system, subsystem, assembly and component following  the British standard BS EN 
60812:2006. Currently, the most common offshore win d turbine uses three blades, a 3-stage 
gearbox, induction generator and a fully rated powe r converter.  The Siemens 3.6MW -120 
turbine is selected for this project as an example of this configuration.  The main objectives 
of undertaking this comprehensive FMEA are to ident ify critical components and their failures 
with significant impact on the wind turbine operati on in terms of maintainability, safety and 
availability.  The assessment identified 500 compon ents and almost 1000 failure causes.  The 
most critical assemblies identified in terms of sev erity, occurrence and undetectability of the 
failure are; the frequency converter, pitch system,  yaw system and gearbox. 
The implementation of a condition-based maintenance  philosophy, including the 
development of real predictive approaches which est imate the remaining useful life of 
degrading critical components has been analysed by the recent literature.  However, 
developing such capabilities for the critical assem blies identified is a significant technical 
challenge.  This study aims to develop and demonstr ate the implementation of a 
methodology and appropriate algorithms to optimise O&M of offshore wind farms, by 
estimating the remaining useful life of critical co mponents with greater accuracy using a 
combination of physics-based models, statistical-ba sed models and data mining approaches. 
A register of trends and likely the main causes of failures of the power converter, gearbox, 
yaw system and pitch system was generated through a  thorough literature search and 
participation in conferences and workshops during t he project. The main sources of failure of 
the power converter and gearbox have been represent ed by algorithms and physics-based 
models developed in Python and proprietary software , respectively. These algorithms 
comprise two phases: diagnosis or learning phase us ing historical data (such as SCADA or 
digital information recorded by condition monitorin g systems) and prognosis phase using 
simulated data (using as a basis the wind turbine a ero-elastic software FASTv8).  The pitch 
system failure mechanisms were explored using a com bination of data mining approaches 
and subject matter expert knowledge.  Examples of a pproaches investigated and 
implemented include: Support Vector Machine (SVM) t o define normal behaviour and K 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
5 Nearest Neighbour (KNN) to classify new observation s regarding operation state (green for 
normal operation, amber for abnormal operation, red  for failure).  New observations with 
amber or red colours need to be analysed further, t o diagnose potential failure modes using 
a decision tree algorithm with more variables relat ed to the pitch system.  
The goals of developing a well-defined strategy for  maintenance interventions and optimised 
management of wind farm logistics are required to e ffectively improve wind farm availability 
while reducing the cost of operations.  Additionall y, a clear identification of uncertainties 
inherent in stochastic processes, necessary for est imating access, failure prognosis and failure 
probabilities is required for operators to make inf ormed decisions.  The final output of this 
work is an O&M cost model which analyses and compar es a conventional O&M strategy using 
a combination of preventive and reactive maintenanc e against an O&M strategy using the 
approaches described above for failure prognosis an d diagnosis.  The analysis is performed 
for a fictitious offshore wind farm with one-year o perational data.  The results include 
availability, downtime, the cost of repair, loss of  production, revenue losses and the hidden 
CO2 emissions of the maintenance activities taking into account a combined probability level 
to account for the uncertainties.

19 Definitions of key terms 
Reliability  ‘is the ability of an item to perform a required f unction under given conditions for 
a given time interval. Reliability represents the p robability of items to perform their required 
functions for a desired period of time without fail ure in specified environments; however 
reliability does not account for any repair actions  that may take place’  (IEC 60050-191) [1]. 
Risk  is “defined as the combination of the probability of an event and its consequences 
(ISO/IEC Guide 73)” [2]. 
Maintainability  ‘is the probability that a given active maintenanc e action for an item under 
given conditions of use can be carried out within a  stated time interval, when the 
maintenance is performed under stated conditions an d using stated procedures and 
resources’. 
Accessibility  ‘is a qualitative or quantitative measure of the e ase of gaining access to a 
component for the purposes of maintenance’. 
Availability  ‘is the ability of an item to be in a state to per form a required function under 
given conditions at a given instant of time or over  a given time interval, assuming that the 
required external resources are provided. In other words, availability represents the 
probability that a system is capable of conducting its required function when it is called upon, 
given that it is not failed or undergoing a repair action. Therefore, not only is availability a 
function of reliability, but it is also a function of maintainability’ [1][3].  
Life Cycle Cost Analysis  ‘is the quantification of the expenses in differen t phases of the 
project. This is important due to capital costs and  risk placement involved in offshore wind 
farms’  [4]. 
CAPEX  (capital expenditures) are one-time expenditures a nd comprise the cost of planning, 
manufacturing and installing the offshore energy pr oject.  
OPEX are  expenditures occurring for marine energy project op eration e.g. inspection, 
maintenance, repair.  
Failure  is the inability of a sub-assembly to perform its required function under defined 
conditions [3].  
Failure Mode  is the specific manner or way by which a failure o ccurs[3]. 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
20 Failure Root  what caused the failure mode to occur[3]. 
Maintenance Optimisation is a process that attempts to balance the maintenan ce 
requirements (legislative, economic, technical, etc .) and the resources used to carry out the 
maintenance program (people, spares, consumables, e quipment, facilities, etc.) [5]. 
Prognosis and Diagnosis  differ in the nature of the analysis; diagnosis in volves posterior event 
analysis identifying the occurrence of an event whi ch has already happened. Prognosis is 
concerned with prior event analysis predicting the future behaviour of a system under 
observation [6] [6].  
Failure Mode and Effects Analysis is used to determine what parts fail, why they usua lly fail 
and what effect their failure has on the system[7].  
Repair action can be an addition of a new part, exchange of parts , removal of a damaged part, 
changes or adjustment to settings, software update,  lubrication or cleaning  [8]. 
Non-repairable system  is discarded after a failure. Examples of non-repa irable systems are 
small batteries or light bulbs  [8]. 
Repairable system:  A system that, when a failure occurs, can be resto red into operational 
condition after any action of repair, other than re placement of the entire system. Examples 
of repairable systems are WTs, car engines, electri cal generators and computers  [8]. 
Mean time between failures  defines the mean time between failures expressed i n hours of 
operations for a specific module population. It doe s NOT mean that a module will operate for 
that many hours before failure [3]. 
Mean time to failure  is used when evaluating no repairable systems. MTB F assumes that a 
device is to experience multiple failures in a life time, and after each failure a repair occurs. 
For non-repairable systems, there is no repair. The refore, in the lifetime of a non-repairable 
device, the device fails once and MTTF represents t he average time until this failure occurs 
[3]. 
Weather window  is a period of time during which if a given mainte nance operation is started, 
it can be completed  [9].

22 CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION 
 
“In the last 20 years turbines have increased in po wer 
by a factor of 100, the cost of energy has reduced,  
and the industry has moved from an idealistic fring e 
activity to the edge of conventional power 
generation” 
“A modern wind turbine operates for about 13 years 
in a design life of 20 and is almost always unatten ded. 
A motor vehicle, by comparison, is manned, 
frequently maintained and its design life of about 
150,000 kilometres is equivalent to just 4 months o f 
continuous operation.” 
European Wind Energy Assoc., Wind Energy - The Fact s, 2005 
1.1 Introduction 
This chapter aims to provide a general understandin g of the project and current the 
methodologies to optimise the O&M of offshore wind turbines; section 1.2 describes the 
current state of the offshore wind industry, proced ures and challenges. Section 1.3 describes 
the objectives of the project, thesis structure and  publications, and finally, section 1.4 
describes the contribution to the knowledge of the thesis.  
1.2 Thesis Background 
Renewable energy resources that directly or indirec tly come from the sun and moon have 
different operational availabilities, which is the ability of a system to perform its function 
under certain operational conditions and time. Curr ently, among renewable energy 
technologies, wind energy technology is the most av ailable and mature. The contribution of 
offshore wind energy has made an impact on the ener gy systems during recent years 
compared with other technologies [10]. In Europe, 1 8GW of offshore wind has been installed 
since 2008, of which over 95% has been installed in  the past ten years [11] .  
The largest offshore wind market is in the UK with 36% of the global installed capacity, 
followed by Germany with 29%. In 2016, China took t hird place with 11% leaving Denmark in 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
23 the fourth place with 8.8%  [12]. Table 1 shows the  total number of offshore wind turbines 
connect to the grid in European countries.

The offshore wind industry has grown in the past ye ars in European waters, and further 
growth is expected in Europe with the target of 20%  of renewable energy by 2020. Wind 
energy plays a key role around the world to satisfy  future energy demand  [13]. The UK 
government considers that offshore wind power shoul d play a major part in meeting the UK’s 
renewable energy and carbon emission targets by 202 0. Therefore, it is developing a strategy 
of having a diverse mix of low-carbon energy source s  [14].  
In offshore wind turbines, the cost of maintenance is a considerable part of the total life-cycle 
cost, between 20 – 35% of the lifetime power genera tion cost  [15]. Studies have shown that 
most of the downtime is due to some critical compon ents of the turbines. Reliability and 
productivity can be improved by optimising maintena nce practices and focused condition-
based maintenance for those critical components ewh ile reducing costs and improving safety 
[8].  
One of the major targets of the marine energy indus try is to reduce the cost of energy. When 
considering future wind farms located far offshore,  in remote locations, with increased power 
rating, maintenance strategies and advanced O&M too ls are likely to be expensive, requiring 
large resources and will be technically challenging  [1][16]. According to the International 
Energy Agency (IEA), US$380 trillion are needed to meet the projected worldwide energy 
demand until 2035, and a significant portion is due  to maintenance and operation of wind 
energy systems  [17]. Typical maintenance costs for  the offshore situation, including costs for 
maintaining the farm infrastructure, civil structur es, etc. are given below  [18]: 
• Preventive maintenance 0.003 to 0.006 (€/kWh) 
• Corrective maintenance 0.005 to 0.010 (€/kWh)

24 Table 2 below shows the operational performance in the early operation in 2010 of four UK 
offshore wind farms. The annual average technical a vailability for reporting the UK round 1 
offshore wind farms is 80.2%, much less than the av erage availability of 97% achieved by 
onshore wind farms in the UK or the availability at  93.3% achieved by an established EU 
offshore wind farm [14]. In 2018, the UK’s offshore  wind farms showed an operational 
availability above 94% [19]

1.3 Thesis Description  
1.3.1 Aims 
The main aim of this work is to reduce the cost of maintenance activities and to improve 
turbine availability through the development of new  methodologies for failure prognosis and 
diagnosis. The failure prognosis will be based on a  deterministic model in combination with a 
risk-based assessment. The proposed project will be  delivered by the completion of the 
following objectives: 
• Initial literature review of failure rates, mode an d analysis of critical components of 
offshore wind turbines.  
• To create a risk model to analyse structural, mecha nical and electrical failure modes 
of critical components of the offshore wind turbine . 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
25 • To create a physical model of the device to calcula te loads associated with identified 
failure modes. 
• To create a deterministic model with algorithms of individual damage accumulation 
based on a combination of measurements and numerica l model simulations. 
• To develop a cost function for maintenance tasks an d data processing system. 
 
The datasets used for this project come from dispar ate data sources. The following lists 
some key inputs: 
• FMEA of a generic wind turbines 
• Recognised and peer-reviewed long-term reliability data (for instance from the EU 
Framework 7 Project, Reliawind) 
• Lloyd’s Register experience built up from working w ith wind farm operators 
• Operational data of a UK’s offshore wind farm: Main tenance task reports, 
technicians’ logs, marine coordinators’ records, ve ssel skippers records, personnel 
tracking systems, Automatic Identification System r ecords (AIS), showing vessel 
movements 
• Reliability data from SCADA databases (UK’s offshor e wind farm) 
• Reliability data from other industrial sectors for similar components under 
equivalent conditions of operation. 
1.3.2 Thesis Outline 
Figure 1 describes the thesis structure:  
Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 introduce the research prob lem and present a literature review of 
the factors impacting Operation and Maintenance (O& M) optimisation of offshore wind 
farms. Furthermore,  these chapters explore key fin dings, outputs and definitions related to 
the research problem of key offshore wind industry stakeholders. 
Chapter 3 describes a risk assessment using the too l Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA). 
The risk assessment is performed for the turbine Si emens 3.6MW-120. The chapter describes 
the procedure based on standards, data sources, a n ew methodology for data and uncertainty 
control, results and final discussion. The main out put of this section is the definition of the 
four most critical assemblies in the Siemens 3.6MW- 120, which are explored further in the 
following chapters. 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
26 Chapter 4 describes the physics-based models of the  gearbox, power converter and yaw 
system, respectively. The models determine the accu mulated damage and the remaining 
useful life. This chapter also introduces the metho dology proposed to generate future events 
for prognostic purposes. The aero-elastic computer- aided engineering tool for horizontal axis 
wind turbines FASTv8 developed by NREL is used to r epresent the turbine structural and 
mechanical behaviour. The outputs of this section a re several variables such as torque, wind 
turbulence, wind speed and rotational speed. A meth odology is proposed to predict these 
variables for several months in advance.  
Chapter 5 aims to describe a data mining approach t o detect any abnormal behaviour in the 
pitch system using subject matter expert knowledge.  The approach proposes a decision tree 
algorithm to diagnose failure mode using a combinat ion of SCADA data variables.  
Finally, Chapter 6 presents the development of the O&M cost function, which includes 
outputs such as cost of repair, downtime, availabil ity, Mean Time to Repair, etc.. The cost 
model is able to analyse the most salient aspects o f the O&M strategy including turbine 
availability, spare parts logistic, access, cost of  components and others.

1.4 Thesis contribution to knowledge 
The main contribution of this project is the identi fication, development and demonstration of 
methodologies applied in the optimisation of offsho re wind farm O&M. It is based on the 
synthesis, combination and demonstration of establi shed approaches of previous studies, 
which have combined deterministic and probabilistic  methods to identify factors contributing 
to the O&M costs and turbine availability. The spec ific contributions are: 
• Development of a rigorous, systematic and consisten t index to manage data and 
uncertainties in the risk assessment of the offshor e wind turbine. 
• Application of methods and software routinely used in design analysis for O&M 
diagnostics including the calculation of damage acc umulation and remaining useful 
life for critical assemblies.  
• Development of a comprehensive approach for O&M cos t analysis including outputs 
such as turbine downtime, cost of repair, logistic delay time; and inputs such as virtual 
sensors, failure rates and weather windows, cost of  spare part, spare part availability 
and time to repair.

29 CHAPTER 2 – LITERATURE REVIEW 
This chapter critically reviews publications releva nt to O&M of offshore renewable energy 
systems, particularly literature related to offshor e wind turbine reliability and maintenance 
optimisation. Maintenance optimisation is a key par t of the research, and it is described from 
different point of views. In order to understand th e component’s functionalities and materials 
used in the construction and design of offshore win d turbines, Section 2.1 presents a turbine 
description and analysis of components and failure characteristics.  
In Section 2.2, current maintenance strategies for wind farms and relevant factors for their 
optimisation are presented. A review of failure det ection approaches are presented in this 
section, which is the base for Section 2.3; a risk based assessment for wind turbines.  
2.1 Offshore Wind Turbines – configuration and syst ems 
The differences of the terms used to describe the s everal parts of the wind turbine are a 
common problem when different wind turbine failure surveys are analysed. The following 
terminology used in [20] [20] will be adopted in th is work: 
• System: for the entire wind turbine and the connect ion infrastructures. 
• Subsystem: to generically indicate part of the wind  turbine that deals with the same 
form of energy, for example the entire drive train.  
• Subassembly: to indicate devices performing more sp ecific functions for which the 
failure data are recorded separately, for example, the gearbox. 
• Component: to indicate small devices typically non repairable constituting the 
subassemblies, for example, the gearbox/generator c oupling. 
 
This section discusses the functions, design materi als and condition monitoring of the main 
components, subassemblies and subsystems of a wind turbine shown in Figure 2. It also 
identifies from the literature critical components,  probabilities, causes of failure, 
consequences of failures and, diagnosis techniques.

31 2.1.1 Components Functionality, Materials and Failu re Characteristics 
Rotor and Blades 
Due to their physical characteristics such as achie ving high strength and stiffness to weight 
ratio, blades are usually made from composite mater ials in Table 3. They have good corrosion 
resistance for the hostile environment and good ele ctrical insulation  [23]. 
Table 3. Composites and binders used in manufacturi ng wind turbine blades [5] 
Composites  Binders or Resins  
Fibreglass  Polyester (unsaturated)  
Carbon fibre  Vinyl ester 
Wood Epoxy 
  
Blades comprises two main parts: the spar and the s kin. The spar gives the structural stiffness 
and, the skin shapes the airfoil. The three most co mmon shapes of blades are defined based 
on wind turbine technology and aerodynamic consider ations; near optimum, linear taper and 
constant chord [5]. Blades also have bushes glued i nto their root which copes with the 
dynamic loads, and are linked to the hub by bolts [ 5,20,24] [5,20,24]. 
Usually, blades failures are produced by cycling lo ading which comes from the interaction 
between centrifugal, gravitational forces and, wind  thrust and turbulence. Blades can fail due 
to cracks arising from fatigue during normal operat ion as well as materials defects, lightning 
strikes and icing [5]. The author in ] [25] describ es the four main failure mechanisms of 
composite materials: fibre fracture, fibre/matrix d ebonding, matrix cracking and 
delamination. 
Other rotor faults are described by the authors in  [26] and [27]: blade surface roughness due 
to pollution such as dirt and insects, damages of t he painting in the surface such as cracks and 
blowholes and, icing. The imbalance in the rotor an d aerodynamic asymmetry may be caused 
by the following reasons: manufacturer defects, non -uniform accumulation of ice or 
moisture, or accumulated damage to the rotor blades . It is necessary to stop the turbine when 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
32 there is a severe imbalance. Production tolerances or permanent deformation during 
operation could be another cause of imbalance. 
Main Shaft 
The drive train is a crucial subsystem for the reli ability of the wind turbine. It includes the 
main shaft, the main bearings, the coupling, the ge nerator and the gearbox. The main shaft 
connects the hub with the gearbox supported by the main bearing and transmitting rotational 
forces. Usually, the main shaft is made from forged  alloy steel or graphite iron to allow more 
complex shapes. It also has a hole bored down the c entre to enable communications and 
monitoring and to reduce the overall weight  [5,20, 24]   
Failures of the main shaft will be analysed separat ely in the following sub-sections. 
Main Bearings 
The purpose of the main bearing is to decrease fric tion in the connection of hub and the main-
shaft. The main bearing is attached to the nacelle.  It is typically designed specifically for wind 
energy applications with spherical roller shape. To  deal with radial loads and axial forces, the 
main bearing has two sets of rollers. The spherical  shape allows the rings of the bearing in 
operation to have a maximum of a half degree of mis alignment without damaging [5] [5]. 
Among the main causes of failure in the main bearin gs are poor lubrication, wear, pitting and 
deformation of bearing components  [26].   
Gearbox 
The gearbox is the heaviest and most expensive part s of the turbine. It constitutes 13% of the 
value of a typical onshore wind turbine. There are 175,000 geared turbines in operation with 
1,200 failures reported each year with a cost in th e range of US$200,000 to US$300,000  [28]. 
The replacement of the complete gearbox, including equipment, crane time, labour and lost 
production, can reach up to $500,000 [29]. The auth or in  [30] states that gearboxes cause 
only 6.7% of total turbine stops but 55% of the dow ntime.  
The gearbox increases the low speed of the rotor in  the main shaft to high speed in the 
generator, usually around 1500 to 1800 rpm. A three -stage planetary gearbox is usually used 
in a multi-megawatts turbine, see Figure 4 [31]. Th e first two stages are planetary 
configuration, and the third one is a parallel. The  planetary parts comprise a ring wheel which 
is an interior toothed gear wheel, three or more pl anet wheels which are smaller toothed 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
33 gear wheels and the sun wheel, a toothed gear wheel  in the centre [5].  The high speed shaft 
of the gearbox is connected to the generator throug h a flexible coupling made from rubber 
to absorb and allow misalignments between the gearb ox and the generator [32].   
 
 
Figure 4. Typical Wind Turbine 3-stage Gearbox [31]  
 
The gearbox as one of the most problematic critical  components based on the latest 
literature. Mean time between failures (MTTF) of ge arboxes is projected to be approximately 
ten years [33]. The most important issue in the rel iability in the drive train is the wear of the 
gear teeth and bearings in the gearbox  [27]. The m ain causes of failure of the gearbox include: 
particles in the oil owing to contamination during assembly, corrosion and wear; variations in 
rotor speed owing to imbalance, variations in wind speed, etc., The main failure modes are: 
the gear teeth to chatter, causing fretting and gen erating particles; stress concentrations in 
gear teeth due to wear or machining; mechanical int erference or other manufacturing 
problems such as heat treatments or surface finish out of specification; loss of oil or oil 
circulation, see figure 5, 6 and 7. Additionally to  the mentioned causes of failure, it is also 
possible to add false brinelling due to vibrations of small loads or small contact areas with 
very large local stress that can arise during trans port or long periods of "parked-braked-
status". For that reason, the main shaft of the gea rbox can be rotated slowly during transport 
to vary contact location and distribute lubrication  over rolling elements of bearings and gear 
teeth.  
Common gearbox failures identified in  [28]are manu facturing defects, cracking of bearing 
coatings, and ineffective lubrication. Based on [34 ], one major cause of -bearing failures in 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
34 the gearbox is axial cracking, identified with irre gular white areas that appear when affected 
bearing surfaces are examined. Axial bearing cracki ng are lengthwise cracks on the bearing’s 
inner ring along the roller path. Axial-cracking fa ilures are common in bearings of the 
intermediate and high-speed stages.  
The main causes of failure identified in [35] are i nsufficient or contaminated lubrication, the 
share of total failure costs are shown in Table 4 . The author also concluded that half of the 
failures were caused by the bearings and caused by poor fitting, poor lubrication, 
contamination and fatigue. On the other hand, gearw heel failures represent the highest 
downtime. The causes of the main failures of the ge ars are fretting corrosion and bending 
fatigue. 
Table 4. Share of total failure costs in the gearbo x [35] [35] 
Failure Mode  Failure cost as percentage of total cost  
High speed shaft bearing failure  27.8%  
Broken intermediate s haft  21.2%  
Intermediate shaft bearing failure  10.1%  
Planet bearing failure  9.6%  
Broken centre post  6.2%  
High speed shaft bearing black spot  5.4%  
Sun gear - Broken teeth  5.3%  
Low -speed shaft bearing failure  5.0%  
Intermediate shaft bearing failure  4.8 % 
High speed shaft grinding temper failure  2.3%  
Broken low -sp eed wheel  1.2%  
Oil pump failure  0.8%  
Intermediate shaft splash plate failure  0.2%  
 
The author in [30] represents the criticality of th e gearbox components in a vulnerability map, 
Figure 5. This map is based on the fatigue damage o f gears and bearings  [31]. The most critical 
components are the high-speed bearings and the high -speed gears.

Generator 
Due to its advantages of mature technology, low cos t and compact structure, induction 
generators are commonly used in wind and marine tur bines. Studies present that wind 
turbine generators show a higher failure rate than steam turbo-generators. The author in  
[36], shows the distribution of failure (stator, ro tor, and bearings) summarised in Table 5. 
Failure in rotating machines depends on size, volta ge and type of machine. It is also possible 
to conclude, based on the surveys described in this  study that the larger the wind turbine 
generator, the less reliable it is as dielectric st ress and vibration are more significant than in 
small machines [37].

Stator  9% 2% 37% 13% 
Rotor  6% 1% 10% 8% 
Other  10% 2% 12% 38% 
 
The main cause of failure of an induction generator  occurs in the bearings, so maintenance is 
mainly focused on lubrication. Generators can opera te at different power frequencies, 
however, overheating and torque pulsations may occu r if it is connected to a weak grid with 
an unbalanced three-phase load [5][23]. 
There are different types of WT configurations ther efore; there are different types of 
generators with different reliability and failure m odes. A common configuration is WT with 
gearbox, high-speed asynchronous generator and part ially rated converted DFIG. On the 
other hand, a less common configuration is a direct  drive WT without gearbox, low-speed 
synchronous generator and a fully rated converter.

37 Pitching System 
The blade pitching system is one of the control sys tems of a wind turbine to maximise energy 
conversion, limits power extraction and, evade stre ss or damage in the components due to 
variable wind. The pitch system is designed to work  within a minimum and maximum wind 
speed. The pitching system has two purposes; aerody namic power control and aerodynamic 
braking [24][38].  
 
Figure 7. Hydraulic unit of pitching system (Turbin e VESTAS V39/V4x/V90). [24] [24] 
Each blade has an independent pitching actuator whi ch comprises a hydraulic cylinder and 
piston rod [5]. An example of the hydraulic unit of  the pitching system is shown in Figure 7. 
Unexpected distribution of stress within the bearin g due to raceways flexibility is the main 
cause of failure. The hydraulic system can show fai lure modes such as leakages, overpressure 
and corrosion [38].  
Mechanical Brakes 
A mechanical brake is essential for any turbine sin ce a fault in braking the wind turbine 
rotation may result in loss of the whole structure or catastrophic failure [24]. 
The mechanical braking system has two objectives: t o support the function of the pitch 
system and its aerodynamic brake when the rotationa l speed of the drive train reaches 
intolerable levels and, to brake the wind turbine w hen it is not operating. The mechanical 
brake is usually located on the high speed shaft, b etween the gearbox and the generator and 
it comprises a brake disc, brake pads and callipers   [5] [23]. See figure below. 
 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
38  
Figure 8. Example of wind turbine brake system [24]  [24] 
Mechanical brake failures can be caused by excessiv e wear on brake linings. The hydraulic 
system pump can present failures caused by contamin ation of hydraulic fluid, wrong oil 
viscosity, premature failure of cylinders as a resu lt of high hydraulic fluid temperature, 
hydraulic valve failure caused by cavitation, fault y circuit protection devices, and seal failure  
[5]. 
Control System 
The control system is defined in IEC 612400-2 as “… a sub-system of wind turbine that receives 
information about the condition of the wind turbine  and/or its environment and adjusts the 
turbine in order to maintain it within its operatin g limit”. The design requirements of the 
control system can be found in the standard IEC 614 00-1  [5].  The main objective of the 
control system is to avoid excessive mechanical loa d, to maximise power output and power 
quality [39].  
There two main control strategies in variable speed  wind turbines: below-rated power where 
the speed controller will adjust the rotor speed to  maintain the maximum power coefficient 
at that speed level. The second strategy occurs abo ve the rated wind speed, where the pitch 
angle is controlled to maintain a constant rotor sp eed [40]. 
Despite the fact that the sensors, cables, software  and hardware have a high quality, damaged 
sensors giving false positive or false negative can  result in WT shutdown. National Renewable 
Energy Laboratory (NREL) states that software relia bility is not estimated and its failure modes 
are not predictable. It is extremely difficult to t est all in-put sequences therefore; a large 
number of harmful faults in the software will not b e detected [5]. 
 
 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
39 Electrical System 
In addition to the generator which constitutes a di fferent subassembly, the electrical system 
comprises all the electro-mechanical devices that a llow the connection of the generator to 
the network. The electric system of a wind turbine is by far the most complex subassembly. 
The complexity of the electric system is reflected in the frequency of failure, which is generally 
high, if not the highest in the wind turbine system s of the selected databases. 
The main components of this subsystem are: power co nverter, transformer, switchgear, 
power cables, protection relays, power factor corre ction units, circuit breaker and the 
earthing system. Failures in these components depen d on different mechanical or electrical 
failure modes  [20].  
Structure: Tower, Foundation and Nacelle 
The structure comprises four main parts: the founda tion, the tower, nacelle and the yaw 
system [20]. The nacelle is the housing for most of  the main components of the WT: gearbox, 
generator, brake system, low and high-speed shaft, and others. The nacelle also provides the 
proper environmental conditions in terms of tempera ture, pressure, humidity and salinity, to 
allow the normal operation of the components [23].  
It is worthy to mention the scour activity around t he offshore wind turbine foundations, which 
comprises many technical challenges related to the following issues [41]: 
• Reduction of the structure’s stability 
• Vertical, horizontal and angular misalignment of th e tower 
• Increased hydraulic loading on the vertical face of  the structure 
• Increased maximum moments at the foundation structu re 
• Decrease and variation in the natural frequency of the turbine 
• Need for more complicated foundation design require ments 
• Increased bending stresses on cables, which may exc eed the design limits. 
Yaw System 
The yaw system allows the nacelle to align with the  wind direction, and it is essential to the 
functioning of a turbine with an upwind rotor  [20] . The specific type of yaw system is defined 
based on the topology of the rotor, there are two t ypes of yawing systems; active and free. 
Active yaw consists of a motor that actively aligns  the turbine with the wind direction, see 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
40 Figure 9  [5]. A WT could have, depending on the WT  types and construction, between 4 and 
8 independent hydraulic or electric yaw drive syste ms. See figure below. 
 
Figure 9. Example of a yaw system.[42] [42] 
Bearing failures, pinion and bull gear teeth pittin g, yaw brake failure, pinion and bull gear 
teeth wear-out are the main causes of failure of a yaw system  [5][43]. 
2.1.2 Critical Components of an Offshore Wind Turbi ne 
A reliability study can be useful in areas of risk analysis, optimisation of operations and 
maintenance. Reliability data is analysed to provid e information as a basis for the decision. 
This work identifies critical wind turbine componen ts based on the analysis of reliability data 
in previous studies. These identified critical comp onents will optimise the necessary resources 
to performed risk-based assessment of the wind turb ine. The risk analysis is a way of 
identifying probability of causes and consequences of failure events, and the optimization is 
a way of telling how failures can be prevented, whe re to focus the efforts on and how to 
improve the availability of a system [23]. 
This section identifies critical components based o n cost, failure rates, consequences of 
failure that represent significant financial loss a nd downtime. One of the hardest matters of 
reliability engineering is obtaining accurate failu re data. Offshore wind turbines are a 
technology highly specialised and due to the commer cial sensitivity of failure data of wind 
turbines, operators and manufacturers are reluctant  to disclose data about reliability or 
failure patterns. Consequently, the sources of info rmation are restricted to databases of 
onshore wind farms publicly available [10,20]. 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
41 WindStats D (WSD), WindStats DK (WSDK) and LWK are three examples of publications 
collecting failure data of different populations of  wind turbines and constitute the main 
source of information to select critical components   [23].

The failures frequency of wind turbines varies with  the scale and type, and it is only possible 
to find in failure analysis based on onshore wind t urbine databases as it is shown in Table 7. 
There is an overall tendency of an increasing failu re rate with turbine size, so it is possible to 
assume the initial failure rate as the turbine size  will increase for offshore applications. Studies 
showed the distribution of failures of the main com ponents divided into five groups; electrical 
system, control system, hydraulic system, sensors, and rotor blades, are responsible for 67% 
of failures as shown in Figure 10 and Figure 11 [21 ][16]. 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
42  
 
Figure 10. Distribution of failures for wind turbin e components  [21].  
It is not possible to detect all the faults occurri ng in an offshore wind turbine using a limited 
number of sensors and huge amount of data to be ana lysed. The study done by Wisznia, 
shows a criterion to select critical components of offshore wind turbines. It states that faults 
must be detectable using simple, reliable and demon strated instrumentation; failures have 
to be detected in the early stages to allow mainten ance plan and, this early detection must 
lead to a significant cost reduction in maintenance  activities [44]. 
 
Figure 11. Failure rates across wind turbine sub-as semblies  [45]. 
The consequence of a failure event can be measured according to numerous criteria, 
commonly failure modes effects analysis (FMECA or F MEA) is used to evaluate the criticality. 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
43 Unfortunately, the failure data do not allow a prac tical and rather accurate criticality index 
such as the total cost of the repair however; downt ime information is available and can be 
used as a criticality index. Availability of spare parts, availability of personnel, accessibility to 
the WT site, weather conditions and the corrective maintenance policy are factors that might 
affect downtime of the turbine [20]. 
The author in [15] concluded that the failure contr ibution of critical assemblies out of the 
total is: pitch system (16%), frequency converter ( 12%), yaw system (12%), control system 
(14%), generator (6%) assembly and gearbox (5%).  
Blades, gearbox, generator, yaw system, hydraulic s ystem, electrical and control system are 
shown in Figure 11, as the main sources of failure.  Likewise, the blades, gearbox, generator, 
electrical, drive train and control system are cost  significant items within a wind turbine in 
terms of downtime. Therefore, it is essential to fo cus the maintenance efforts on the 
identified critical components [5][21]. 
2.1.3 Condition Monitoring Techniques for Offshore Wind Turbines 
An efficient condition monitoring system relies on the correct understanding of the machine 
and its subassemblies, objective and analysis of re liability data, correct selection of critical 
components or subassemblies, proper data acquisitio n techniques, correct analysis of 
monitored data and reasonable strategy for machine condition assessment [46].  
Due to clear benefits of offshore wind energy compa red with the industry onshore, including 
a greater capacity factor, there is a wide number o f condition monitoring techniques currently 
available [47][16]. 
Condition monitoring techniques have been used in m any industrial sectors. Different 
systems have become commercially available for appl ication to wind turbines, such as 
vibration monitoring systems for bearings and gearb oxes, online oil monitoring systems as 
well as the temperature of bearings, generator wind ings, etc. [47] [48]. 
The reduced offshore availability and accessibility  and increasing trend for offshore wind 
deployment require an effective and reliable condit ion based maintenance process with 
condition monitoring systems instead of the combina tion of reactive and scheduled 
maintenance strategy. The goal of a condition monit oring system is to enhance the availability 
of expensive critical assets and reducing overall O &M costs. Condition based maintenance 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
44 approach aims to reduce maintenance costs by reduci ng the number of planned PM actions; 
thus only when there is evidence of irregular behav iour, maintenance staff will perform 
actions [49][50]. Furthermore, insurance companies give another reason for installing a 
condition monitoring system. Insurance companies re quire for example, that the complete 
drive train of the wind power plant has to be overh auled after 40.000 hours of operations. 
The exception to this clause is if a condition moni toring system recognised by the insurance 
company is installed. The leading insurance compani es within wind power have created 
requirements for condition monitoring systems on wi nd power plants [23]. 
CMS, detection and diagnosis of failures techniques  have been increasingly used in the 
offshore wind energy sector. CMS has been regarded as a crucial tool for achieving their 
expected availability as a result of the economic l oss caused by the unexpected breakdown. 
Furthermore, the added values of their CM can be fu rther extended to guarantee the quality 
of the power they generated [24,37]. The main reaso ns to use CMS are: 
• Maintenance cost reduction 
• Detection and prediction of faults in the early sta ges 
• Reliability and availability improvements 
The importance of monitoring system due to its char acteristics are listed in Table 8: 
Table 8. Characteristics of condition monitoring sy stems [51] 
Characteristics  Advantages  Benefits  
Early warning  -Avoid breakdowns  
-Better planning of maintenance -Avoid repair costs  
-Minimise downtime 
Identification of 
problem -Right service at the right time  
-Minimising unnecessary 
replacements.  
-Problems resolved before the time of 
guarantee expires -Prolonged lifetime  
-Lowered maintenance costs 
-Quality-controlled operations 
during time of guarantee 
Continuous 
monitoring -Constant information that the wind 
power system is working -Security. Less stress  
  
Condition monitoring system (CMS) involves several sensors gathering physical data from the 
functional subsystems of the offshore wind or tidal  turbine. Sensors also transfer the data to 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
45 a centralised node for processing. The final aim of  the CMS is to predict the fault of a critical 
component to optimise the required actions and impr ove the reliability and availability of the 
OWT. It is important to mention that any failure wi thin the sensors creates an extra 
maintenance cost for the installed system.  
CMS can be divided into three stages, first detecti ng an unusual operation condition that is 
outside of the right theoretical behaviour or healt hy range. The second stage is diagnosing 
the failure root responsible for the unusual operat ion condition and third forecasting the 
remaining life of the component based on physics of  failure of probabilities  [44].  
Wind turbine CMS commercially available shown in su rveys [22] [43][50] show a clear trend 
towards vibration signals based techniques. The vib ration monitoring mainly covers the 
turbine drive train where rotating machinery is inv olved. Other techniques such as fibre optic 
based strain measurement for blades and oil debris analyses for gearboxes  are also used to 
monitor key subsystems and components of offshore w ind turbines.  
Based on  [52], CMS with the basis of a significant  change is a symptom of a developing failure, 
include combinations sensors and signal processing equipment that provide constant signs of 
the component, subsystem and system condition. CMS could be performed on-line to provide 
real-time condition feedback or, off-line where dat a are collected at regular time intervals 
using measurement systems that are not integrated w ith the equipment. The following 
techniques possibly applicable for offshore wind tu rbine have been identified based on the 
literature  [43] [50][51]: 
Vibration analysis  
Vibration analysis is the most known technology app lied for rotating equipment. The types of 
sensors used depend on some degree on the frequency  range relevant for the monitoring. 
Some sensors of this technique are position transdu cers for the low-frequency range, velocity 
sensors in the middle frequency area, accelerometer s in the high-frequency range and 
spectral emitted energy sensors for very high frequ encies (acoustic vibrations). Vibration 
analysis is used in wind turbines to monitor the wh eels and bearings of the gearbox, bearings 
of the generator and the main bearing [51,53].   
Fast Fourier transformation is the signal processin g technique commonly used to convert a 
time-domain signal into a frequency-domain signal. The vibration analysis technique is 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
46 applied to shafts, bearings, gearboxes, and blades,  and it is standardised in ISO10816 which 
defines the positioning and use of sensors. Vibrati on analysis methods are easy to implement 
in existing equipment and have a high level of inte rpretation, making it easy to locate the 
exact damaged component, see Figure 12. However, th is approach comprises the use of 
additional hardware and software, which increases t he production costs [21]. 
In [54], the author explores the problem of automat ic signal validation. A number of typical 
signal inaccuracies encountered in large databases were shown. As a result of the research, 
the authors show an algorithm for automatic validat ion of vibration signals. The algorithm for 
automatic signal validation was extended to the sta tistical signal description, followed by a 
short discussion on additional vibration signal con strains concerning random impacts, 
transient states and signal offset.

An example of implementation and allocation of acce lerometers of a Vestas turbine is shown

narrow band analysis, the nacelle oscillation induc ed by the rotational speed of the rotor with 
static accelerometers and the vibration induced by bearings and gearwheels [51]. 
Oil analysis 
Oil debris monitoring is a practical condition moni toring technique for the early detection of 
faults in bearing and gears of the gearbox. 80% of gearbox problems can be attributed to the 
bearings with consequential damage to the gearing [ 21].

This technique could have two aims; protection of t he oil quality which can be contaminated 
by parts or moist and, protection the components in volved. It is typically performed off-line, 
by taking samples but, for protecting the oil quali ty on-line sensors application is increasing. 
Condition monitoring of oil filter state by measuri ng the pressure loss over the filter now is 
mostly applied for hydraulic as well as for lubrica tion oil. Excessive filter pollution, oil 
contamination or change in component characteristic s can give an indication of components 
with excessive wear [22,51]. 
This analysis uses the pumped oil in a closed-loop system of the component, and metal debris 
from cracked gearbox wheels or bearings is caught b y a filter. The amount and type of metal 
debris can indicate the health of the component. Si x main tests are mentioned in [21]: 
Viscosity analysis, oxidation analysis, water conte nt or acid content analysis, particle count 
analysis, component condition (wear) analysis and t emperature. 
The technology for on-line detection can be broadly  divided into three subcategories 
depending on the sensing techniques applied: electr omagnetic sensing, flow or pressure-drop 
sensing, and optical debris sensing. In terms of co st, size, accuracy, and development, suitable 
oil monitoring technologies are online ferrography,  selective fluorescence spectroscopy, 
scattering measurements, Fourier transform infrared  (IR) spectroscopy, photo acoustic 
spectroscopy, and solid-state viscometry [33][50]. In  [56] the author presented a high-
throughput, high-sensitivity inductive sensor for t he detection of micro-scale metallic debris 
in nonconductive lubrication oil. The device is abl e to detect and differentiate ferrous and 
non-ferrous metallic debris in lubrication oil with  high efficiency. The main disadvantages of 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
48 this technique are that it is very expensive, and i t is only focused to detect a failure in the 
gearbox [50]. 
Thermography and Temperature Measurement 
Thermography technique is usually applied in electr onic and electric components. 
Deterioration, damage or bad contact of these type of components generate higher 
temperatures (hot spots) that can be identified wit h this technique. It is applied offline, and 
often involves visual understanding.  Currently, it  is not particularly designed for online 
condition monitoring however, the necessary equipme nt, such as cameras and software, are 
starting to become available [22][51] 
On the other hand, temperature measurement techniqu e is able to detect excessive 
mechanical friction due to faulty bearings and gear s, insufficient lubricant properties, and 
loose or bad electrical connections [42]. It provid es an indication of the ongoing deterioration 
process. Due to each component or equipment has a l imited operational temperature this 
technique is considered reliable however, as the te mperature develops slowly, the 
temperature measurement technique is not sufficient  for early failure prognosis and 
diagnosis. It can also be affected by ambient condi tions  [50].  
Electrical effects 
Condition monitoring of electrical equipment such a s power converter, generators and 
transformer is typically performed using voltage an d current analysis. Discharge 
measurements are used for medium and high voltage g rids. A spectral analysis of the stator 
current in the generator can be used for detecting isolation faults in the cabling without 
influencing WT operation [22]. 
Nuisance Alarms 
Nuisance alarms have been an issue for operators du e to the additional cost that they might 
cause. The author in [54] developed an algorithm fo r the automatic validation of vibration 
signals in the condition monitoring system to minim ise the risk of anomalies in a wind farm. 
Based on amplitude validation, the vibration data a re validated via an original implementation 
of Parseval’s theorem. The “N-point” rule is a simp le and powerful technique for automatic 
signal error detection [21,54].

2.1.4 Condition Monitoring using SCADA data 
The Standard IEC61400-25 is used as a basis for the  data exchange and communication 
software and procedures between condition monitorin g techniques, the wind turbine 
controller, the SCADA System, Farm Server and human  users. Data has to be made available 
without any time delay, "real-time data". For this type of data, hardware signals must be 
made available according to analogue and digital bu s system. Figure 14 shows an exchange 
network structure for real-time data  [57]. 
 
 
Figure 14. Real time data exchange network structur e  [57]. 
The SCADA system has been used in the wind industry  for more than 35 years. SCADA sends 
turbine operational and meteorological data, usuall y in a 10-minute averaged, in real-time to 
a remote central computer via a communication syste m  [50][52]. SCADA system provides 
data of the rotational speed and pitch angle of the  rotor, information of the drive train such 
as the gearbox oil and bearing temperatures, power output from the generator, wind speed 
and ambient temperature. This operational health da ta of the turbines can be used as part of 
a general turbine condition monitoring system [16].   
Condition monitoring based SCADA has the advantage over traditional CMS of significantly 
lower cost due to the lack of need of expensive sen sors. Using accelerometers to obtain 
vibration signals is an example of expensive system s. Furthermore, CMS has a significantly 
greater volume of data to be analysed than the SCAD A system and also a greater requirement 
of data storage. The higher frequency of sampling, defined in  [50], is more than 10kHz 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
51 sampling frequency for a vibration monitoring syste m and the SCADA system samples has a 
frequency of less than 0.002Hz [16].  
Techniques that are commonly used for traditional w ind turbine condition monitoring 
including the approaches based on turbine physics a nd data-based modelling, can be 
implemented using SCADA data. According to  [58], 1 0 minutes averaged signals often 
monitored in modern SCADA systems include: 
• Active power output (and standard deviation over 10  min interval) 
• Anemometer-measured wind speed (and standard deviat ion over 10 min interval) 
• Gearbox bearing temperature 
• Gearbox lubrication oil temperature  
• Generator winding temperature 
• Power factor 
• Reactive power 
• Phase currents 
• Nacelle temperature (1-hour average).  
Most modern SCADA systems comprise additional alarm  settings based on temperature 
transducers and based on vibration transducers in t he gearbox, generator bearings and the 
turbine main bearing. Vibration being observed over  the 10 minutes average period is the 
basis of alarms. ReliaWind carried out a research o f CMS through SCADA  [7]. 
SCADA combined with other machine learning’s techni ques represent a powerful tool. The 
study in  [7] proposes and compares two methods to detect and identify incipient faults in 
key components of wind turbines, such as main beari ng, gearbox and blades. The analysis of 
this SCADA data comprises two methods: Artificial N eural Network (ANN) and mathematical 
model method. In [59] presents a machine learning m ethodology to detect and diagnose the 
delamination of the wind turbine blades. Delaminati on is the separation of the composite 
material layers and generates stress concentration in certain points. The techniques applied 
in this study are: autoregressive Yule-Walker model , K-nearest neighbours and ANN. Most 
recently, a complete review of machine learning tec hniques for condition monitoring of wind 
turbines is presented in [60]. ANN, support vector machines and decision trees are the most 
common techniques for blade fault detection and gen erator temperature monitoring.

52 2.2 Maintenance of Offshore Wind Farms 
British Standard (BS) 3811 defines maintenance as “ …the combination of all technical and 
associated administrative actions intended to retai n an item or system in, or restore it to, a 
state in which it can perform its required function ”. Internationally, it is defined that the 
highest priority for O&M is the safety of personnel  and to facilitate the remote control access 
of turbine control systems in order to investigate,  rectify and re-set trips where possible [61] 
[59]. 
 
There are different ways of reducing the operation and maintenance costs, for example, by 
reducing the need for maintenance. Maintenance opti misation can be achieved by designing 
a simpler wind turbine, reducing the number of comp onents and using components with high 
reliability. However, even with a very reliable win d turbine, maintenance will be necessary 
[62] [60][63] [61]. 
Studies suggest that the cost O&M represents 14% to  30% of an offshore wind farm total 
operation cost. O&M activities are governed by regu lations requirements, condition 
monitoring techniques available in the market and t heir associated costs  [13]. It is estimated 
that optimal maintenance could reduce 40-70% of the  direct O&M cost and could improve 
7% of the turbine availability  [5]  [17].

53  
The most common maintenance approaches are Correcti ve Maintenance (CM) activity which 
is performed after the failure occurs and Preventiv e Maintenance (PM) activity which is 
performed before the failure of a component, see fi gure 3. CM strategy is typically applied 
when failure consequences do not represent revenue losses or health and safety impact [23]. 
Failures of critical components of a turbine can be  catastrophic with severe operational and 
Health, Safety and Environmental consequences. Ther efore, the feasibility of a CM strategy is 
given by the consequences of failures on the electr icity network and revenue generation [5]. 
PM activities can be divided into two different tec hniques; statistical based and condition 
based preventive maintenance.PM activity following a predefined schedule, e.g. once a year, 
is called Scheduled Maintenance (SM) and based on s tatistics of failures. PM activity planned 
based on sensor information or condition of the com ponent, is called Condition Based 
Maintenance (CBM) [64] [62][65]. PM strategy, commo nly also called Time-Based 
Maintenance (TBM), includes periodic maintenance ac tions at regular intervals of time. This 
strategy is often implemented due to warranty reaso ns with the OEM and to maintain critical 
components with known failure data under control. N evertheless, the selection of the proper 
length of the interval of time to perform the maint enance tasks has the disadvantages; Figure 
16 shows frequent maintenance actions will increase  operational costs, it wastes production 
time and it unnecessary replaces components in good  condition [5].  
 
Figure 16. Corrective Maintenance compared to Sched uled Preventive Maintenance [3].  
As it is stated before, O&M management of offshore wind turbines has gained big significance 
with the increase of wind energy capacity installed  in the electric power systems. Several 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
54 maintenance strategies focused on optimising the co st have been developed by experts. It is 
important to understand the reliability of a wind t urbine to formulate an optimal 
maintenance strategy however; offshore wind turbine  failure statistics are not freely available 
due to commercial restrictions. In his study Spinat o [20] presented results of reliability 
analysis on a subassembly level based on publicly a vailable databases from Germany and 
Denmark [64] [62].  
In the literature, different approaches for reliabi lity analysis of wind turbines have been 
proposed. Reliawind project was founded by EU FP7 t o improve the design, maintenance and 
operation of wind turbines. Within Reliawind projec t a reliability analysis procedure has been 
outlined to give procedures for performing reliabil ity evaluation of wind turbines.  
To effectively manage the reliability and availabil ity of offshore wind turbines, a number of 
tools and techniques taking into account economic, health, safety and environmental issues 
have been proposed. These techniques include  [5]: 
• Reliability-Centred Maintenance (RCM)  
• Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) 
• Hazard and Operability studies (HAZOP) 
• Hazard Analysis (HAZAN)  
• Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) 
• Event Tree Analysis (ETA) 
• Critical Task Analysis (CTA) 
• Quantified Risk Analysis (QRA)  
• Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) 
• Risk Based Inspection (RBI) 
• Root Cause Analysis (RCA)  
• Structured What-if Technique (SWIFT) 
 
The following table summarises e advantages and dis advantages of the three most common 
maintenance strategies [23]:

2.2.1 Reliability Centred Maintenance (RCM) 
The author in [66] [63] defines RCM as “an approach  that employs reactive, preventive, and 
proactive maintenance practices and strategies in a n integrated manner to increase the 
probability that a machine or component will functi on in the required manner over its design 
lifecycle with minimum maintenance”. 
Large and complex technology systems such as aircra ft and wind turbines must be reliable 
and maintainable in order to operate in both ways, safe and cost-effective. This task requires 
the application of sound engineering effort from de sign to decommissioning.  
The integration between the RCM with reliability an d maintainability engineering practices 
was first done the 1970s in the airline's industry.  RCM is now extensively applied by several 
industries, including power plants.   
The author in [67] [64] states that RCM is based on  the premise that more efficient life time 
maintenance and logistic support programs can be de veloped using a disciplined decision 
logic analysis process. This process is focused on the consequences of failure and the 
necessary preventive maintenance tasks. RCM is  tec hnique, that can be applied in every step 
of the project development, from design to developm ent process and re-assessed after 
deployment, during operation.  
The main tasks of the RCM process are performed bas ed on the following areas: 
 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
56 • Hard-time replacement (HTR): degradation due to age  and usage before functional 
failure can be prevented by replacement or overhaul  at a fixed interval or loading 
cycles. 
• On-condition maintenance: degradation before failur e is detected by inspections and 
assessments during a certain period. The inspection  interval should be the largest that 
comprises a reasonable probability of successful de tection.  
• Condition monitoring: degradation before failure is  detected by a sensoring system 
(e.g. temperature, vibration, pressure, etc.). This  represents a permanent surveillance 
using built-in test equipment.  
 
In general, terms, the complete RCM process can be described as follows: 
1.  Critical component identification using a failure m odes analysis tool.  
2.  Definition and application of the RCM decision logi c to each critical component. This 
will allow the optimal combination of hard-time rep lacement, on-condition 
maintenance and condition monitoring tasks. It will  also define if a new design is 
required. 
3.  Implementation of maintenance tasks and definition of data requirements for logistics 
analysis.  
4.  RCM process optimisation using operational data.  
 
The risk assessment tool, FMECA is one of the most relevant data sources since it provides a 
strong foundation for the RCM decision logic. The A uthor in [67] [64], states that RCM 
structure for an operating system might be used as an information management system. RCM 
is able to register failure and their consequences,  assess reliability based on the age of critical 
assemblies, incorporate new maintenances tasks, ass ess on-going tasks, and deal with 
unexpected failures.  
The application of the RCM technique comprises desi gn features and operational functions 
information of the system, its failures and consequ ences to select the most effective CMS, 
on-condition maintenance and HTR maintenance tasks.  The overall objective is to develop a 
maintenance strategy focused on the consequences of  failure and designed to generate the 
expected safety and reliability level, while the co st of maintenance is reduced.

57 RCM of wind turbines 
RCM in wind farms is the way to manage turbine down time and poor performance by failure 
prevention. It comprises a proactive approach of O& M however, for large wind farms the 
complexity increases due to the large number of int eractions between individual elements.   
The authors in [65] present a RCM approach using a sequence of several activities and steps 
(see Figure 17) that can be summarised in two steps  [66] [63]: 
• Inductive analysis of potential failures: use of FM EA tool to define critical components 
or assemblies.  
• Application of logical decision diagrams: specifica tion of preventive maintenance 
activities, replacements, etc. 
 
Figure 17. RCM stages [66] [63]. 
 
The author in [66] [63] presents the RCM framework described in Figure 18, where it is possible to 
analyse how RCM stages interact with each other. Da ta collection and analysis are crucial input for 
RCM and spans across the lifecycle of the project [ 66] [63].

2.2.2 Spare parts management 
Spare part management has been identified as a key factor in O&M strategies and can account for 
between 8.3% and 16.7% of the total O&M costs [68] [65]. Therefore, its successful deployment can 
lead to cost reductions. Each wind turbine can have  around 8000 of components, therefore, to 
minimise the downtime due to spare part availabilit y, there must be sufficient access to them at all 
times [69] [66]. There is a lack of understanding o f the related information and data. ORE Catapult 
organisation in [68] [65] compares the offshore win d industry with the aerospace industry, which 
shares the same asset lifetime, technology complexi ty level, supply chain and logistics challenges.  
The positives impacts of tools and solution related  to spare part logistics in the aerospace industry are 
a reduction of aircraft on-ground time which is equ ivalent to offshore turbine downtime, reduction of 
the value of the spare part in inventory, and impro ving the spare part availability.  
There are thousands of components in each offshore wind turbine and to minimize any logistic delay 
time, the access to replacements need to be expedit ious.  
The key performance indicators defined in [68] [65]  to control the spare part logistics are: 
• Unscheduled downtime 
• Spare part availability 
• Inventory management 
• Response time 
• Abortive work, parts delayed 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
59 2.2.3 O&M Strategy factors 
There are three factors used to select an appropria te maintenance strategy for any physical 
asset such as a wind turbine; failure consequences,  predictability of lifetime, and the 
feasibility of installing CMS on the wind or tidal turbine. A maintenance strategy that is 
appropriately optimised now may not be optimal in t he near future due to the 
unpredictability of factors such as interest rate, components cost, failure behaviour, etc. Thus, 
maintenance optimisation is a continuous process wh ich requires periodic evaluation of 
performance and improving based on previous actions  [5]. 
2.2.4 Condition Based Maintenance 
Condition-based maintenance involves continuous mon itoring of system data to provide an 
accurate assessment of the component status of a wi nd turbine and taking actions based on 
its observed health. To be able to assess the statu s of a wind turbine components, it is 
necessary improved sensor technologies, data collec tion, storage and processing capabilities, 
and continuous improvements in algorithms and data analysis techniques. It uses real-time 
system monitoring and data processing as described in section 2.6. The aim of this approach 
is to provide an accurate estimation of the remaini ng useful life and the current condition of 
the monitored critical component; this is called fa ilure prognosis  [49] [27].  
Condition monitoring of components enables planning  of maintenance prior to failure and 
will minimise downtime and repair costs since compo nents remaining life will be optimised 
and the coordination of spare parts will be easy. A dditionally, trends and statistical data such 
as mean time to failure can be provided which is im portant for getting reliable data for the 
remaining lifetime of components in the system. Wit h site-specific data the prediction of the 
remaining time for the components can be more preci se [23]. Figure 19 shows a comparison 
between condition-based, corrective and preventive maintenance strategies. 
 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
60  
Figure 19. Condition based maintenance compared to scheduled and corrective 
maintenance. [23] [23] 
The Authors in [70] and [65] propose a maintenance strategy selection method to improve the cost 
effectiveness of offshore wind systems. These metho ds comprise an algorithm to optimise grouping 
several maintenance tasks. The algorithm has inputs  such as turbine reliability, weather condition, 
maintenance tasks characteristics, power generation  and so on.  
2.2.5 Fault Prognostic 
The author in [71] [67] reviews some of the most im portant issues concerning fatigue 
degradation, test methods for materials characteris ation, and how the damage mechanisms 
behave. Most life prediction models are experientia l and are based on macroscopic 
measurements. There are many empirical relations fo r predicting fatigue life such as power 
laws like Baquin’s relation, straight fits to S-log  N data, Coffin and Manson’s relation.  
Prognosis is based on the assumption that failure i s a process, not an event. Therefore, early 
detection of the failure will give more flexibility  to manage the degradation process [27]. 
Failure prognosis is the process of generating pred ictions and pattern understanding of a 
signal or fault indicator. The final aim is to esti mate the remaining useful life (RUL) [72] [68]. 
The main limitation of failure prognosis is the unc ertainties associated with the predictions 
and it can be approached with to techniques; uncert ainty representation and uncertainty 
management.  
Figure 20 shows the probability density function of  the RUL generated by a prognosis process, 
giving a distribution of when is likely the failure  occurs in time. At time tp, the remaining life 
prediction is made and a maximum allowable probabil ity of failure has to be selected to define 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
61 what is called “just on time point” at which it is carried out the corrective maintenance actions 
[49]. 
 
Figure 20. Remaining useful life probability distri bution [49]. 
 
The lead time interval provides a real-time estimat e of the remaining time before a system 
operates above the maximum allowable probability of  failure (PoF). Maintenance actions 
must be performed before this time elapses. Factors  such as safety, criticality and economic 
considerations determine the maximum allowable prob ability of failure. [49].   
The author in [6] [6] divided prognostic techniques  into three categories: experience-based 
approaches, trending or data-driven approaches and model-based approaches. See Figure 21. 
 
 
Figure 21. Prognosis techniques [6] 
 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
62 Experience-Based Prognostic Approach is the simples t technique due to it depends on 
statistical historical failure rates of wind turbin e components. Models of components’ lifetime 
can be developed in terms of distributions of failu re rates over time using preventive 
maintenance schedules. Mean time between failures ( MBTF), derived from lifetimemodels, is 
a parameter used to define the maintenance actions’  intervals. This approach does not have 
any prognostic ability and cannot be considered as really predictive prognostic technique. 
However, such approaches are used in situations whe re sensor data is not available and the 
criticality or cost of the component is low.  
On the other hand, a model-based prognostic techniq ue has ability to incorporate physical 
understanding of the component behaviour, predictin g degradation under variable or 
oscillating loads and operating conditions. It uses  the physics of failure models of the system 
or component under observation. The most popular ap plication of this approach is fatigue 
models for modelling the initiation and propagation  of cracks in structural components.  
Finally, the last approach is used when the complex ity of the systems under observation does 
not allow deriving accurate models for prognosis. D ata-Based prognostic technique model the 
relationship between monitored signals, and the rem aining life of the system. An example of 
data-driven techniques is Artificial Neural Network s (ANN) [6].  
ANNs are defined in [49] as a tool “to model relati onships between input and output variables 
with a model structure inspired by the neural struc ture of the brain. The network weights and 
biases, which define the interconnections between t he neurons, are adapted during a training 
process to maximise the fit between the input and o utput data on which the models are 
trained”. 
The author in [73] summarises the methods to predic t the remaining useful life of wind 
turbines. They are categorised into four groups: 
1.  Knowledge-based models 
2.  Life expectancy models 
3.  Artificial neural networks 
4.  Physical models 
Most of the techniques for failures prognosis are a pplied to gearboxes, main bearing and, 
blade and pitch control.  
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
63 Another Data-Driven approach for fault detection of  wind turbines is proposed in [74]. This 
study uses random forests and xgboost techniques to  classify failures.  
One of the most relevant limitations of these model s representing degradation of 
components is the type of data available. SCADA dat a sample does not have the resolution 
require for some applications. On the other hand, t he sensoring system installed in a turbine 
can degrade or improve reliability. Additionally, t he condition monitoring system are 
designed to diagnose a particular component using c ertain parameters that are not always 
useful to conclude about the overall health of the turbine.  
2.3 Risk Assessment Approach for Offshore Wind Turb ines 
Quantitative analyses of failure data have shown im portant features of failure rate values and 
trends  [46]. Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FM EA) has been extensively used by wind 
turbine assembly manufacturers for risk and reliabi lity analysis. Basically, each failure mode 
of the wind turbine is evaluated in the FMEA taking  into account Severity (S), Occurrence (O), 
and the difficulty of detection (D). The combinatio n of the three results in the Risk Priority 
Number (RPN). 
Several limitations are associated with its impleme ntation in offshore wind farms:  
• Unreliable data: failure data gathered the data sys tems such as SCADA system, is often 
missing or unreliable. The risk assessment regardin g severity, occurrence, and fault 
detection are mainly based on subject matter expert  knowledge.  
• Uncertainties and assumption: it is difficult for s ubject matter experts to precisely 
evaluate the risk factors. 
• Factors weights: the relative importance among the risk factors is considered in the 
evaluation therefore, the results may not necessari ly represent the true risk priorities. 
To express fuzzy linguistics terms, the author in [ 75] [69] proposes a grey theory analysis to 
incorporate the relative importance of the risk fac tors into the determination of risk priority 
of failure modes.  
The advantages of this approach are:  
• An organised framework to combine the qualitative a nd quantitative data as inputs 
in the FMEA. 
• The relative importance weights of severity, occurr ence and detection factors.

64 A fuzzy-FMEA approach for risk and failure mode ana lysis in offshore wind turbine systems is 
proposed in [76] [70]. Fuzzy logic is a tool for tr ansforming the vagueness of human feeling 
and recognition into a mathematical formula. It als o provides a meaningful representation of 
measurement for uncertainties and vague concepts ex pressed in natural language. In line 
with this, there has been a growing trend in FMEA l iterature to use fuzzy linguistic terms for 
describing the three risk factors S, O, and D.  
A probabilistic model of Risk-based Maintenance is presented in [77] [71]. Here, a prior 
damage model is combined with data from load measur ements, inspections, and the SCADA 
system to improve the estimate of the probability o f failure. To make probabilistic graphical 
models that represent the relationship between rand om variables, it is possible to deploy 
Bayesian networks  [16]. Bayesian networks are grap hical models based on Bayes’s Rule. This 
rule presents the probabilistic relationship betwee n variables with uncertainties [78] [72].

65 CHAPTER 3 – FAILURE MODES AND EFFECTS ANALYSIS (FME A) 
A risk assessment is required to identify critical assemblies and components of the Offshore 
Wind Turbine (OWT). This section comprises a qualit ative analysis of failure mechanisms, 
global and local effects and, the maintenance effor t required to improve the condition of the 
assemblies.  
The FMEA comprises almost 500 components with about  1000 failure modes in total. This risk 
assessment gives details of the failure impacts at the component level. The comprehensive 
FMEA also delivers two analysis in parallel; operat ional risk with the Risk Priority Number 
(RPN) and the criticality analysis with four catego ries, environment, asset integrity, safety and 
operation. Additionally, new data sources managemen t tools are designed. This tool allows 
identifying those areas where more research or real  data are required. Finally, this thesis 
proposes a three-dimensional risk assessment adding  to the traditional FMEAs with failure 
consequence and frequency, the variable failure det ectability.  
3.1 Introduction 
This chapter presents the results of Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) conducted for 
the horizontal axis OWT described in section 3.1.2.  The FMEA was performed for the 
functional modes of each subsystem, assembly and co mponent following the British standard 
BS EN 60812:2006 described in section 3.2.5. This r isk assessment was an iterative process 
and outcome of a combination of available data and practical experience with the operation 
of wind farms.  
The main objectives of the FMEA are to identify fai lures with significant impact on the wind 
turbine operation and to highlight areas of risk fo r maintainability and availability. Critical 
components and failure modes will be explored furth er in Chapter 3  and 4 which are related 
to physics-based models and data mining. The proced ure allocates numerical values from 1 
to 5 to each risk associated with a failure, using Severity, Occurrence and Detection as 
categories. The values of the ranking rise when the  risk increases. These are then combined 
into a Risk Priority Number (RPN), which can be use d to analyse the system. By targeting high 
RPN values the riskiest components and assemblies c an be further studied. RPN is calculated 
by multiplying the Severity, Occurrence and Detecti on of the risk. 
Additionally, this chapter comprises the descriptio n of a Criticality analysis to assess the 
impact of a failure mode from an environmental, fin ancial and reputational point of view. 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
66 Based on EN 60812:2006, Criticality can assume diff erent meanings; for the purposes of this 
study Criticality is defined as “a qualitative meas ure of the magnitude of the failure mode 
effect in different categories: Environment, Safety , Asset Integrity and Operation.” 
3.1.1 Scope 
This analysis delivers an assessment for the propos ed Offshore Wind Turbine (OWT) mounted 
in a monopile foundation. FMEA provides a bottom-up  approach to the analysis of each main 
assembly in order to identify potential failure mod es and, the local and global effects in the 
system. It also provides current monitoring techniq ues and methods to prevent failure.  
The qualitative FMEA will answer the following ques tions for each assembly’s component: 
• How can a component fail? How many failure modes ea ch component can have? 
• What are the causes of each failure mode? 
• What are the effects of the failure on the wind tur bine? 
• How critical are the effects? How frequent are the effects? Can be the effects 
detected? 
• How is the failure detected? 
• What are the critical components/assemblies? 
Critical components analysis provides a summary of the selected components whose failure 
modes can represent a negative impact on the system  in different severity categories: asset 
integrity, environmental impact, operational impact  and safety.   
The FMEA is intended to be a living tool that will be iterated in order to represent real failure 
modes and contribute to improve reliability, mainta inability, availability and survivability of 
offshore wind turbines. This tool is also crucial t o assess the amount of maintenance required.  
3.1.2 Wind Turbine System 
Until 2014, 2488 offshore wind turbines were instal led representing 8GW of capacity 
connected to the grid in Europe. In 2018, the total  amount of grid-connected offshore wind 
turbines was 4.545, reaching 18.5GW of installed ca pacity in 11 European countries. The UK 
and Germany accumulate more than 14GMW today [11]. 63% of this capacity is installed in 
the North Sea. 91% of these turbines use a monopile  foundation type installed in an average 
water depth of 22.4m. In terms of wind turbine manu factures, Siemens Company reached 
86.2% of market share in 2014 [79] [73]. The market  is dominated by Siemens and followed 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
67 by Vestas with a percentage of 15% to 20%. Among th e population of turbines installed in 
Europe the turbine configuration with a fully rated  power converter, 3 blades, monopile 
foundation, 3 stages gearbox and induction generato r is the most common one. As it is shown 
in Figure 22, 64% of the turbines use Squirrel Cage  Induction Generator (SCIG), 29% Double 
Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) and 7% Permanent Mag net Synchronous Generator (PMSG). 
Therefore, 93% of the turbines are using asynchrono us generators of which 63% with fully 
rated power converter as the turbine Siemens SWT 3. 6-120 [79,80] [73,74].  
 
Figure 22. Wind turbine market trends. 
Based on the market description above, the turbine configuration of the Siemens SW3.6 
corresponds to the most utilised turbine technology  of the European offshore wind energy 
market in 2014.  Then, this FMEA is done for the pr oven technology of the world’s most 
popular offshore wind turbine. SWT3.6 is an axial t hree-bladed rotor turbine with pitch 
regulation and asynchronous squirrel cage generator  with fully rated power converter[81] 
[75].

3.2 FMEA and FMECA methodology 
The FMEA and FMECA are conducted in accordance with  the international standard IEC 
described in the British Standard BS EN 60812:2006 “Analysis techniques for system reliability 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
68 - Procedure for failure mode and effects analysis ( FMEA)”. This standard provides procedural 
steps necessary to perform the analyses identifying  appropriate terms, assumptions, 
criticality measures and failure modes. [82] [76] 
The analysis consists of the following five main st ages: 
• Establishment of the basic ground rules for the FME A/FMECA and defining the scope.  
• Defining systems structure including information on  different system elements with 
their characteristics, performances, roles and func tions. 
• Executing the FMEA using the appropriate worksheet with a pre-defined system 
boundary and level of the analysis.   
• Summarising and reporting of the analysis to includ e any conclusions and 
recommendations made. 
• Updating the FMEA as the new inputs are incorporate d. 
3.2.1 Assumptions and Ground Rules 
The analysis has been undertaken for the each subsy stem and component function. In order 
to perform the FMEA, the following assumptions and ground rules are defined [83] [77]: 
1.  The evaluation of the severity, occurrence and dete ctability will be performed at the 
component level of the following hierarchical struc ture which is based on the structure 
proposed in the project ReliaWind [84] [78]:  
 
Figure 24. Hierarchical Wind Turbine Structure [84,85] [78,79] . 
2.  Each component’s failure mode will be evaluated for  the local and global impact on the 
system. Local impact is considered as the impact on  other components or sub-assemblies 
directly mechanically, electrically or structurally  connected. 
3.  A failure mode will be allocated a severity level b ased on the most critical consequence of 
that failure.

69 4.  A failure mode will be assigned an Occurrence categ ory based on the data available.   
Occurrence refers to the frequency that a Cause of Failure (CoF) is likely to occur, 
described in a qualitative way e.g. remote or occas ional. 
5.  Each failure mode identified has a Detection catego ry based on the techniques 
commercially available. Due to this FMEA forms part  of a project to predict failures with 
greater accuracy, Detection category refers to the likelihood of detecting a failure in terms 
of “prognostic horizon” or advance warning.  
6.  The potential failures modes for each component of each subassembly described in Figure 
24 are identified. Potential failure modes are assi gned based on the following criteria 
listed in order of relevance: 
o Numerical data analysis 
o Expert opinions 
o Theoretical data analysis 
o Pre-defined generic failure modes: In the absence o f an expert opinion of a 
particular failure mode, failure modes listed in [8 6] [80] and Lloyd’s Register's 
experts [87] [81] have been used in the FMEA. Gener ic failure modes were defined 
to cover all the possible failure modes that can oc cur in the offshore wind turbine. 
This is shown in  Table 11.

industry. It is listed all the methods available an d defined in the literature review. Generic OWT Failure Mode Description

70 Redundant items are considered in this thesis as a prevention method because this 
strategy allows detecting a failure of a critical c omponent without stopping the operation 
of the system and giving an alert of deviations fro m the normal behaviour of the 
component.

3.2.2 Data sources 
Failure mechanisms in offshore wind turbines and th eir consequences arise from several data 
sources. Using a consistent approach, a knowledge b ase can be developed in order to assess 
events in the offshore wind turbine. Disparate sour ces of data or information are used to 
develop the FMEA: 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
72 • Recognised and peer-reviewed long-term reliability data (for instance from the EU 
Framework 7 Project, Reliawind)  
• Lloyd’s Register experience working with wind farm operators which allow having access 
to expert knowledge of maintenance technicians and managers, maintenance task 
reports, technicians’ logs, marine coordinators’ re cords, vessel skippers’ records. 
• Reliability data from SCADA databases. 
• Reliability data from other industrial sectors for similar components and operational 
conditions. 
• On-going measurements and observations. 
 
3.2.3 Functional Block Diagram 
To aid the analysis, symbolic representations such as functional diagrams of the system and 
operation are very useful. Functional diagrams are created highlighting all the crucial 
functions of the wind turbine. Blocks representing components are linked together by lines 
that represent mechanical, electrical or hydraulic inputs and outputs, as described in Table 
14. 
The diagrams show redundancies and functional inter dependencies of the components that 
allow the analysis of failure through the system. 
The block diagram contains the following items: 
• Breakdown of the system (Figure 25) into major subs ystems, assemblies and components 
(e.g. Figure 26 and Figure 27) including functional  relationships. 
• Appropriately labelled block with names, inputs and  outputs.  
• Redundancies, alternative signal paths and other en gineering features which provide 
protection against system failures.

75 3.2.4 FMEA Worksheet 
Based on the standard BS EN 60812:2006, terms and d efinitions are defined to carry out the 
FMEA: 
Item:   part or component that can be individually consid ered. 
Failure:  termination of the ability of an item to perform a  required function. 
Failure Local Effect:  consequence of a failure mode in terms of the oper ation, function or 
status of the item. The expression “local effects” refers to the effects of the failure mode on 
the system element under consideration. 
Failure Global Effect:  A failure effect may also influence the next level  up and ultimately the 
highest level under analysis. Therefore, at each le vel, the effect of failures on the level above 
should be evaluated. When identifying end effects, the impact of a possible failure on the 
highest system level is defined and evaluated by th e analysis of all intermediate levels 
Failure Mode: the way in which an item fails. 
Failure Mode Reference Number:   The failure mode reference number is a unique ide ntifying 
number assigned to each component of the system bei ng analysed. 
System:  a set of interrelated or interacting elements. 
Failure Severity:  the significance of the failure mode’s effect on i tem operation, on the item 
surrounding, or on the item operator. 
Detection:  For each failure mode, it is determined the way in  which the failure is detected 
and the means by which the user or maintainer is ma de aware of the failure. 
3.2.5 Ratings  
The basis of the FMEA is the Risk Priority Number ( RPN) which is a multiplication of the 
numerical values of severity, occurrence and detect ion ratings assigned to each failure modes.  
Severity Classification Definitions 
To facilitate the analysis of severity and occurren ce ratings and further correlation with 
previous quantitative surveys or studies it is used  reliability concepts based on [3] [3]. The list 
below described key concepts of reliability to asso ciate a qualitative FMEA with quantitative 
variables.  
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
76 • Availability (A): (technical availability: percenta ge of time that an individual turbine 
WT or wind farm is available to generate electricit y expressed as a percentage of the 
theoretical maximum. 
• Mean time to failure MTTF 
• Mean time to repair MTTR 
• Logistic delay time LDT 
• Downtime MTTR+LDT 
• Mean time between failure MTBF = MTTF 
• MTBF=MTTF+MTTR+LDT 
• Failure rate:  λ=1/MTBF 
• Repair rate: μ=1/MTTR 
• Commercial availability: A=(MTBF-MTTR)/MTBF=1-(λ/μ)  
• Technical availability: A=MTTF/MTBF<1-(λ/μ)  
Regarding BS EN 60812:2006, Severity is an assessme nt of the significance of the failure 
mode’s effect on item operation. 
Table 15. Severity Levels 
Label  Value  Description  
Catastrophic  5 wind turbine inoperable with destructive failure wi thout warning  
Critical  4 wind turbine inoperable with equipment damage  
Marginal  3 wind turbine operable with significant degradation of performance  
Minor  2 wind turbine operable with minimal interference  
None  1 no effect on wind turbine operation  
 
The severity ratings in Table 15, give an indicatio n of MTTR, which at the same time is 
represented by repair rate μ. Downtime is the sum o f mean time to repair and the logistic 
delay time.  
Occurrence Classification Definitions 
Regarding BS EN 60812:2006, the probability of occu rrence of each failure mode should be 
determined in order to adequately assess the effect  or criticality of the failure mode. This 
parameter is associated with the failure rate. When  there is no access to registered failure 
rates of offshore wind farms, a good starting point  for estimation is the failure rates data 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
77 available in public databases. The table 16 shows t he failure rate from different databases of 
onshore wind farms. 
Table 16. Failure rates (failures/turbine/year) fro m WSD, WSDK and LWK databases. 
 
Table 17 shows the description of the occurrence ra ting and its association with MTBF. 
Table 17.Occurrence Levels 
Label  Value  Description  
Inevitable  5 failure is almost inevitable, will definitely occur  
Frequent  4 repeated failures with regular occurrence  
Occasional  3 occasional but not necessarily  regular failures  
Rare  2 rare and irregular failures  
Extremely -Unlikely  1 failure almost never occurs, extremely unlikely  
 
Where λ=1/MTBF is the failure rate.  
Detection Classification Definitions 
Since the aim of the project, of which this FMEA ta kes part of, is to optimise the O&M activities 
by improving the accuracy of failure prognosis, thi s rating is defined in terms of the prognostic 
horizon or advance warning. This categorisation all ows for identifying hidden failures.  
Detection classifications are classified from 1 to 5 regarding the following criteria in Table 18 
Table 18.Detection Levels 
Label  Value  Description  
Undetectable  5 Undetectable until failure occurs  
Detectable by O&M  4 Detectable by maintenance team in an average of 3 m onth routine  
Detectable by CMS  3 Detectable by safety system when operat ional parameters are 
exceeded 
Early Prognosis  2 Early prognosis, detectable by the control system during normal 
production

Figure 28 shows the steps followed by the analyst t o allocate the right information for each 
component in the FMEA. After all the components are  listed, the analyst performs the analysis 
of the components one by one.

The last step is to register the data source used i n the assessment by assigning a Confidence 
Level index described in section 3.5. 
3.3 Criticality Analysis 
Criticality concept could assume different perspect ives; in this study, criticality analysis aims 
to qualitatively measure the magnitude of a failure  effect in the different categories as it is 
described in Table 19: safety, environment, asset i ntegrity and operation. It considers a wider

3.4.1 RPN and Failure Contribution 
Table 20 shows a summary of the FMEA describing the  total number of components per 
assembly, the average number of failure per compone nt and, the failure contribution of the 
assemblies. The FMEA comprises 18 main assemblies, 76 sub-systems and 493 components. 
963 potential failures modes are identified and cla ssified by the Risk Priority Number (RPN).  
The failure contribution is the number of the failu res modes identified for each assembly out 
of the total number of failures modes in the turbin e.  1 2 3 4 5

81 Figure 30 presents the average RPNs with the standa rd deviation, which gives an indication 
of the range of RPN values among the components of one particular assembly. The standard 
deviation of the RPNs for each assembly is calculat ed using the following equation: 
 1
  1	
  	
′
 
Where RPN’ is the mean value of the risk priority n umber, and N is the number of components 
for each assembly.  
The assemblies nacelle structure and hydraulic syst em have little variations of RPN values 
while the frequency converter has a wide range of R PN values amongst its components.  
 
Figure 30. Average RPN per assembly. 
 
In order to identify those assemblies that are crit ical for the wind turbine, severity ratings are 
filtered. Those components with “marginal”, “critic al” and “catastrophic” impact on the WT’s 
performance are analysed and highlighted in red in the figure below.  
 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

Figure 31. Average RPN of critical components. 
Figure 32 presents failure contribution as a percen tage of the total number of potential failure 
modes in the offshore wind turbine. This is compare d with the number of failures per 
component of each assembly. It is possible to see t hat the frequency converter has the largest 
failure contribution, but its components have fewer  ways in which to fail. On the other hand, 
assemblies such as pitch system and nacelle structu re, represent a lower contribution to the 
total number of failure however, their components h ave a wider range of failure mechanism. 
From the graph, it is possible to conclude that the  assemblies with greater failure contribution 
are frequency converter, gearbox and the yaw system . Amongst these three assemblies, 
frequency converter has the highest failure contrib ution of the whole wind turbine system 
with 18%, however its identified number of failures  per component is approximately the half 
of the number of failures per component of the gear box with 16% of failure contribution. The 
number of failure per component could be considered  as an indication of component 
reliability, therefore, if the number of failure pe r component if high, the estimated reliability 
of that component could be degraded as it has more chances to fail due to different failure 
root causes. 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

Figure 32. Failure contribution per assembly. 
Once critical assemblies are identified, it is nece ssary to identify how they can fail to put more 
efforts on avoiding those failures with greater imp act on the assembly and therefore, on the 
turbine operation. The figure below shows that the main failure modes for the gearbox and 
frequency converter are electrical failures, and mo st of the main failure modes of the yaw 
and pitch system are mechanical failure.

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
84 To analyse the failure modes in the FMEA, they are grouped into major families of failures.  
Figure 34 shows the major failure mode families and  the number of events counted per failure 
type in the FMEA analysis. It is evident that senso r system failure, and electrical failure are 
the most common type of failures in the wind turbin e. Material and mechanical failure is also 
above average. This graph shows what is the type of  failures that could represent the greatest 
cost in O&M due to their probability of occurrence and where some new strategy could be 
implemented to focus the effort on that number of t he identified failure modes. 
 
Figure 34. Families of failure modes and their numb er of events. 
Figure 35 shows the unique types of failure modes i dentified and their RPN in the FMEA. Here 
it is possible to observe that the majority of the failure in the list has an electrical nature. 
However, the number of events per failure mode, as it is described above; do not represent 
the severity of the failure or the impact on O&M ac tivities. The FMEA shows that failure 
modes with a low number of events like “loose bar” or “shaft scuffing” have high RPN which 
means that this kind of failure needs to be address ed for further analysis due to their 
consequences in the system.

3.4.2 Consequential Damage 
The determination of affected components and conseq uential damage is another capability 
of the FMEA.  
Using a detailed functional diagram of each main as sembly, it is possible to determine 
functional interdependencies between components and  therefore, the potential 
consequential damage and affected components. Each failure mode of a component might 
affect directly another component. The connection b etween both components could be 
mechanical, electrical or hydraulic.  An example of  failure modes and potentially affected 
components are shown in the table below.  Undetectable Failure Modes Count of Failure Modes Ave rage of RPN

3.4.3 Failure Detectability and Criticality 
The RNP comprises the rating ‘detection’ to assess each failure mode from a failure prognosis 
point of view. 173 undetectable failures are identi fied. Amongst this group of failures, there 
are 27 failure modes that bare been identified as c ritical in terms of operation (Ref: Severity 
rating, Critical: wind turbine inoperable with equi pment damage) and undetectable in terms 
of early prognosis. (Ref: Detection rating, Undetec table: Undetectable until failure occurs).

Further analysis of the failures has been performed  in Annex 1: FMEA Failure analysis . Here, 
graphs show the failures that can be detected by CM S (28), failure detectable by the O&M 
team (58) and failures able to generate turbine shu tdown (24).  
3.4.4 Criticality Analysis Results 
In this study, criticality analysis was designed to  complement the RPN analysis identifying 
those failure modes that have a negative impact in other areas such as environment and 
safety. It is also identified the severity of failu re in asset integrity and operation to validate 
the RPN, i.e. acting as a “double check” of the ope rational consequence of failure. 
The values assigned for each category are described  in Table 19, and the identified 
components and failures modes that have a greater i mpact on the environment and safety 
are shown in Table 25 and Table 26, respectively.  
Those components and failures modes that are not id entified by the RPN as severe damage 
to the personnel or the environment are identified by criticality analysis. For example, the 
high friction of the components of the gearbox like  spur gears could produce risky high 
temperature for personnel. Leakage on hoses could h ave a negative impact on the 
environment or health if it is in direct contact wi th the skin. There are other dangerous failures 
modes for personnel in the auxiliary electrical sys tem like live wires with loss of insulation, or 
mechanical damage in the firefighting system in the  nacelle. The results shown in Table 25 
and Table 26 allow the analyst to identify failure for components that can be critical for the 
other wind farm stakeholders: operator, manufacture r, investor, regulators and on. It also 
shows the ranking for the asset integrity and opera tional categories. These two categories 
validate the independent RPN as a combination of bo th would give the analyst a better 
approach and an “error checking system” in the allo cation of values for severity, occurrence 
and detection ratings of the RPN.

As RPN only combine aspects related to turbine oper ation, criticality analysis is performed to 
show an integral analysis with interesting aspects for different wind farm stakeholders.  
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
91 There are four categories: safety, environment, ass et integrity and operation.  
To have consistency in both analyses, the operation  category in the criticality analysis 
assumes the same values assigned to the Severity ra ting in the RPN evaluation. All the 
categories take into the account a frequency which is also matched to the occurrence rating 
of the RPN.  
Table 27 shows that the assembly “Main shaft set” i s the only assembly with high values in all 
the categories.

3.4.5 Top 30 chart for failure mechanisms 
The FMEA allows determining the top 30 chart of fai lure mechanisms of a generic offshore 
wind turbine. The first 10 failures are in the freq uency converter, mainly power electronics 
components at both sides of the converter, generato r and grid side. The type of failures is 
short or open circuit failures due to overheating o r insulation degradation. The second ten 
failures are in the frequency converter but also in  the pitch system with a combination of 
electrical and mechanical failures. Finally, the la st ten failures are in the yaw system and 
frequency converter.

93 3.4.5 Sensitivity Analysis 
Sensitivity analysis provides the sensitivity of ea ch output variable such as RPN, to its input 
variables such as severity and occurrence. It is po ssible to identify the most influential inputs 
affecting RPN or other output in the criticality an alysis. In this study there are two kinds of 
sensitivity analysis, the first one is shown in Fig ure 36, here once the RPN is computed all the 
ratings are decreased by one value and increased by  one value to calculate the minimum and 
maximum RPN possible. The second sensitivity analys is is only varying the severity and 
occurrence variables; this is shown in Figure 37.  
RPN sensitivity analysis aims to establish the best  and worst scenario regarding the estimation 
of the variables “severity”, “occurrence” and “dete ction”. This allows determining the impact 
of an incorrect estimation in the final conclusions  given by the analyst.  
Severity, occurrence and detection ratings are the inputs of the sensitivity analysis and vary 
from 1 to 5. The analysis delivers the minimum and maximum values of the RPN based on the 
nominal or assigned values of the inputs for each f ailure mode. For example Figure 36 shows 
the item in the first column of the FMEA spreadshee t: Gearbox-> Carrier Barings->Failure 
mode: Bearing Stuck->Failure cause: Tooth Failure-> RPN:32 
 
Figure 36.Sensitivity Analysis 
Once the critical components of the assemblies are identified, the three-variable sensitivity 
analysis will be performed. This analysis is shown in Figure 37, where the detection variable 
is assumed to be certain or with a high degree of c onfidence of the rating. Detection rating is 
based on techniques commercially available and well  recognised in the industry. Then, once 
the detection variable is defined, the appropriate matrix can be analysed varying severity and 
occurrence only.  

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
94 For example: Figure 37 is the sensitivity analysis of the carrier bearing of the gearbox with a 
failure mode of “bearing stuck” due to a “tooth fai lure”. The assigned RPN is 32 and the 
“detection rating” is considered as the low chance that the control system will detect 
potential cause or mechanism and failure mode, whic h represents a value of 4. Therefore, the 
sensitivity analysis is carried out with the fourth  matrix. Here we can see that the variation of 
one unit of either occurrence or severity the RPN w ould be 40 of 48, which is still in an 
acceptable “yellow colour band”. The conclusion of this is that even though the analyst, based 
on the information available, made a mistake alloca ting the severity or occurrence values, the 
impact of this specific mistake on the FMEA results  is negligible.  
If the sensitivity analysis of a particular compone nt shows that varying a value of occurrence 
or severity makes the colour band turns orange or r ed, that means that the allocation of the 
severity and occurrence values need to be analysed with greater accuracy to reduce the 
impact on the final FMEA results.

3.4.6 3D Risk Matrix 
The 3D risk matrix developed in this study aims to analyse the criticality of failures looking at 
the risk severity, occurrence and detection ratings  at the same time. The 3D risk matrix shows 
a clear different between failures of the four most  critical assemblies: frequency converter, 
gearbox, pitch system and yaw system.  Figure 38 sh ows an example of the RPN values of one 
assembly in a 3D graph.RPN values toward the top pa rt of the 3D graph mean that the failures 
tend to be hidden or undetectable failures. It is p ossible to see that the frequency converter 
has value mostly in the top part. The gearbox and t he yaw system values tend to be 
concentrated in the centre, and the yaw system has one value highly undetectable but with 
very low consequence.  RPN OCURRENCE RPN OCURRENCE RPN OCURRENCE RPN OCURRENCE RPN OCURRENCE

95 The analysis also delivers the most critical failur es per assembly and their number of 
occurrence. The RPN values are also counted in each  3D matrix.

3.4.7 FMEA comparison with European projects 
Figure 39 shows a comparison of the failure contrib ution of each assembly obtained with the 
FMEA and the average failure rates of onshore wind turbines regarding the WSD, WSDK and 
LWK databases. Those assemblies with a failure cont ribution greater than 6% have also the 
greatest failure rates in the databases. By contras t with the number of failure per components 
of the gearbox and frequency converter, in this cas e gearbox has lower value of failure rate 
than the frequency converter, showing that in an on shore situation the components of the 
gearbox are more reliable than the components of th e frequency converter despite the larger 
number of failure modes per component.

In order to compare the results of the FMEA and the  failure information available in databases 
shown in table 29, the original graphs are combined  in figure 41.   Figure 40 is the original 
graph showing the results of WMEP and LWKF. Here is  possible to appreciate that electrical 
system and control systems have the highest values of annual failure rates and, rotor blades 
and gearbox represent one of the highest downtime i n days of the surveys.

98 Figure 41 aims to reproduce the original graph in F igure 40 along with the FMEA outputs. The 
identified assemblies with highest average values o f occurrence rating that vary from 1 to 5 
are rotor hub and mechanical brake. On the other ha nd, the assemblies with highest average 
values of severity rating are drive train and mecha nical brake. To represent in a better way 
the results of the FMEA, only those components with  a significant impact on the turbine 
performance have been selected. Regarding the Sever ity rating, values related to “marginal”, 
“critical” and “catastrophic” represent the signifi cant degradation of performance, 
equipment damage and destructive failure.

99 3.5 Confidence of the Accuracy of the Assigned Rati ngs (CAAR) 
In order to enable continuous improvement, to ensur e consistency and to incorporate new 
information, a structured audit approach and indexh ave been developed; Confidence of the 
Accuracy of the Assigned Ratings (CAAR) . The main aim of the CAAR index is to answer the 
question of how confident the analyst of the FMEA i s. The main purpose is to standardise the 
confidence level of the accuracy of the assigned ra tings of severity, occurrence and detection 
for each component and assembly. CAAR index is also  a data control strategy registering the 
type of data source used in each evaluation for eac h component. The confidence level 
assessment is based on the availability of the foll owing information and is assessed at the 
component level. The type of data used in the FMEA is categorised as follows: 
• Numerical raw data: quantitative information coming  from a data system such as 
SCADA data. 
• Expert review: subject matter expert review of the FMEA spreadsheet in a particular 
assembly. 
• Theoretical data: information available in the lite rature review with outputs based on 
theory.  
• Analyst judgement: non-expert opinion.  
 
To define criteria on which the confidence can be a ssessed, it is performed a goal sketching 
technique, goal decomposition graph, which helps to  identify main goals and its sub goal to 
reach it. The figure below shows a goal decompositi on graphwhere the main goal is to obtain 
a good accuracy of the assigned ratings of severity , occurrence and detection for each failure 
mode [88] [82]. In this graph, the main goal can be  reached using the analyst judgment (sub-
goal) or using expert opinions (sub-goal). The gree n circle represents that the sub-goal is 
enough to reach the main goal; in this case, the ex pert opinion will satisfy the condition to be 
very confident of the FMEA conclusions. Likewise, t he sub-goal “analyst judgement” is divided 
into two sub-goals: analyst judgement using raw num erical data; and analyst judgement using 
theoretical data.  
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
100  
Figure 42. Goal decomposition graph 
From the goal decomposition graph, it is clear that  there five options to comply with the main 
goal with different percentages of confidence. 
• Numerical raw data (100% Confident) 
• Expert review (90% Confident) 
• Theoretical data (70% Confident) 
• Analyst judgement only (20% Confident) 
• No data at all (0% Confident) 
 
To quantify and standardise the confidence level, a  flow chart is developed, Figure 43. It is 
also considered that for all of the options above t here are uncertainties associated with 
processes and different criteria, therefore, “assum ptions” is defined as a confidence factor 
which describes “the confidence that the assumption  is sound”. This confidence factor is used 
in the flow chart shown in Figure 43 and described in Table 30.

final percentage is multiplied by the assumption le vel (AL) so the CAAR is calculated by: 
CAAR=% * AL.

All the possible results of the CAAR flow chart are  summarised in Table 31. There are three 
ranges A, B and C with different colours. RPNs in t he Range C are considered with a high level 
of confidence in the accuracy of the assigned ratin gs. RPNs in Range A and B need to be 
reviewed further to improve accuracy based on more information.

3.6 Con clusion  
A risk assessment of an offshore wind turbine is cr ucial to generate a database of turbine 
failure rates, failure modes and causes. It is a co mmon tool in the industry to stablish 
inspections intervals. The FMEA tool has been the f oundation of this work identifying critical 
assemblies in terms of operation and consequences o f failure. A comprehensive analysis and 
methodology are proposed to explore the reliability  of the components. The definition of the 
taxonomy of the wind turbine has been essential for  the development of this FMEA and to Value CAAR

103 establish the interfunctional relationship between components. Based on the European 
project ReliaWind, a comprehensive turbine breakdow n was proposed using a hierarchical 
structure. 
The RPN has been developed using three ratings: sev erity, occurrence and detectability of the 
failure. The detectability dimension of the analysi s allows to explore areas of the condition 
monitoring system and to identify the type of failu res that are difficult to detect.  
The FMEA results are the basis for the physics-base d and data mining models as well as for 
the O&M optimisation allowing the determination of consequential damage and local and 
global effects of failures. Gearbox, pitch system, yaw system and power converter have been 
identified as the most critical assemblies in the F MEA.

104 CHAPTER 4 – FAILURE PROGNOSIS BASED ON PHYSICS-BASE D MODELS 
The critical assemblies identified in the previous chapter, power converter and gearbox, are 
analysed using physics-based models of the main fai lure mechanisms. This chapter describes 
the process and the main assumptions and outputs.   
4.1 Introduction 
This chapter describes the methodology developed to  estimate accumulated damage of 
critical components. Section 4.2 presents a method to generate future data to estimate the 
remaining useful life of a particular component of a wind turbine in a particular location. The 
prognosis process comprises the digital representat ion of the turbine Siemens SWT3.6-120 
and Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) Simulations. Se ctions 4.3 and 4.4 present the physics-
based model approaches for the gearbox and power co nverter.  
The power converter and gearbox have been identifie d in the FMEA as one of the most critical 
assemblies regarding risk to the turbine operation.  A method to estimate the remaining useful 
life (RUL) of a fully-rated power converter and a g earbox in a variable speed wind turbine is 
proposed.  
There are two main sources of data used in the phys ics-based models are: 
• SCADA data commonly available for offshore wind far m operators. This historical data 
is used to estimate the accumulated damage. This is  called “diagnostic model”  in 
Figure 50. 
• Wind turbine simulation (FASTv8). These outputs are  used to predict damage in the 
future and the RUL for a particular assembly in a s pecific location. This is called 
“prognostic model” in Figure 50. 
4.2 Prediction methodology 
In order to assess the accumulation of damage withi n the power converter and gearbox, it is 
necessary to realistically emulate the same operati onal conditions in terms of turbine 
structural and electro-mechanical behaviour, and wi nd profile. The digital representation of 
the offshore wind turbine and operation conditions are developed using the aero-hydro-
servo-elastic simulator FASTv8 developed by Nationa l Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). 
The methodology proposed to create variables in the  future for failure prognosis uses a 
Monte Carlo Markov Chain technique.

105 4.2.1 Wind Turbine dynamic integrated system in FAS Tv8 
To achieve realistic results, load cases proposed b y the IEC 61400-3 (power production 
category) using FASTv8, are used. The standard prop oses some design situations representing 
the various modes of operation that an offshore win d turbine would experience during its 
operational life; each design situation leads to a number of Design Load Cases (DLCs). The IEC 
standard distinguishes two types of load cases, ult imate and fatigue load cases and 
recommends appropriate load factors to be associate d with these load cases to evaluate the 
structural integrity. The selected load cases are s hown in Table 33. A turbulent full-field wind 
matrix is created by TurbSim [89] [83] as an input to FASTv8.  
The analysis is based on the three-bladed horizonta l 3.6MW turbine model, variable speed 
control system, mounted on a monopile with a rigid foundation, induction generator, 3 stage 
gearbox and fully power converter. Wind condition i s site-specific.

106 In this design situation DLC 1.2, a wind turbine is  running and connected to the electric load. 
DLC 1.2 represents the requirements for loads resul ting from the atmospheric turbulence that 
occurs during normal operation of a wind turbine th roughout its lifetime (NTM). DLC 2.4 
describes a transient event triggered by a fault or  the loss of an electrical network connection 
while the turbine is producing power. DLC 3.1 inclu des all the events resulting in loads on a 
wind turbine during the transients from any standst ill or idling situation to power production. 
DLC 6.4 comprises a number of hours of non-power pr oduction time at a fluctuating load 
appropriate for each wind speed where significant f atigue damage can occur to any 
components. Finally, DLC 7.2 considers deviations f rom the normal behaviour of a parked 
wind turbine, resulting from faults on the electric al network or in the wind turbine [90] [84].  
The range of wind speeds may be represented by a se t of discrete values, in which case the 
resolution shall be sufficient to assure the accura cy of the calculation.  In general, a resolution 
of 2 m/s is considered sufficient. Therefore taking  into account the cut-in and cut-out wind 
speeds [81] [75], the wind speeds bin are: 
Vin = 5 (m/s) 
Vout = 25 (m/s) 
Wind speeds (m/s) to the model are 11 bins:  
5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 
 
Normal turbulence model (NTM)  
For NTM, the representative value of the turbulence  standard deviation, σ1, shall be given by 
the 90 % quantile for the given hub height wind spe ed. This value for the standard wind 
turbine classes in Table 34, is being given by: 
1 =  0.75ℎ +  ;  = 5.6"
# 
Where Vhub is the wind speed at the hub height. Ire f is the expected value of hub-height 
turbulence intensity at a 10 min average wind speed . Vref is the reference wind speed average 
over 10min. A, B and C designate the category for h igher, medium and lower turbulence 
characteristics. Iref is the expected value of the turbulence intensity at 15 m/s.

Values for the turbulence standard deviation σ1 and  the turbulence intensity hub σ1/Vhub

FASTv8 can create a full-field, turbulent-wind simu lation. A time series of three-component 
wind-speed vectors at points in a two-dimensional v ertical rectangular grid that is fixed in 
space is created to represent operational condition s, see Figure 46 [89] [83].

FASTv8 outputs 
FASTv8 is able to deliver many types of variables f rom mechanical and structural parameters 
to electrical variables. For the estimation of the remaining useful life of the gearbox and 
power converter, the variables power output, low-sp eed shaft torque, low and high-speed 
shaft rotational speeds, generator current and gene rator voltages are selected. 
The load case DLC 1.2 represents most of the situat ions of the turbine operational conditions. 
Simulations are categorised by Wind speed [m/s], Tu rbulence intensity [%], Significant Wave 
Height [m], Wave spectral period [s], Yaw error [de g], and Turbulent wind speed.  
For DLC 1.2 there are 66 simulations of 620 second each. For each wind speed, there are six 
simulations for three different yaw errors (-8, 0, 8 degrees) with two turbulent wind seeds. 
An example of the outputs is given in Table 35.

4.2.2 Generation of future events for failure progn osis 
After the simulation of FASTv8, it is necessary to establish a methodology to create a future 
time series of variables to estimate RUL of the com ponents. This innovative approach starts 
with the assumption that not all the simulated load  cases in Table 33 , wind speeds and 
random seeds are experienced by the turbine in 1-ye ar period. Therefore, it is necessary to 
derive statistical (probabilities of occurrence) in formation of load cases and wind speeds from 
the SCADA data. A decision tree is proposed to filt er and identify load cases, wind speeds and 
turbine operational conditions in the data set. Thu s, the probability of each simulation output 
of FASTv8 is determined and added to Table 35, in r ed. These probabilities are the input for 
the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) tool to create a random sequence of variables and 
their respective simulated time until a future year  is created.  
MCMC tool is selected assuming stationary transitio n probabilities. A sequence of random 
elements of some set, such as wind speeds or load c ases, can be defined by MCMC if the 
conditional distribution X n+1  given X 1, X2…, X n depends on X n only [92] [85]. Figure 47  shows 
an example of a transition graph and transition mat rix of a discrete MCMC where each event 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
110 in the sequence only depends only on the events occ urring directly before. For instance, when 
the current state is load case 1 (LC1), there is a probability of 0.6 to move to LC2, then there 
is a probability of 0.3 to stay in LC2, a probabili ty of 0.1 to go back to LC1, a probability of 0.4 
to move to LC3 and so on. Therefore, it is possible  to generate future scenarios of variables 
by applying MCMC with probabilities distribution of  load cases and wind speeds, Figure 48 .  
The simulation of each load case in FASTv8 gives th e same outputs in the time domain which 
are related to structural loading, bending moments,  and operation parameters such as 
rotational speed, wind speed and direction, shaft t orques and power output. These FAST 
outputs are the inputs for the physics-based models  of the gearbox and power converter.

Figure 48. Example of the probability distribution of load cases. 
The IEC standard suggests simulation time for each load case (620 seconds with a resolution 
of 0.05 seconds), these time periods are concatenat ed in order to generate the whole period 
(1 year) in the future for prediction purposes. Fig ure 49 shows an example of a future scenario

113 4.3.1 Gearbox failure investigation 
The complexity of failure interaction is extensivel y reviewed in the fields of WT reliability. The aut hor 
in [93], describes three types of failure interacti ons: first, failure of a component results in the t otal 
failures of all other components; second, failure o f component 1 increases the failure rate of 
component 2 and; third, a system can presents a com bination of the option 1 and 2. In this study, the 
overall condition is represented by the failure wit h the known highest failure rate.  A probabilistic 
approach is proposed in [94], where a Bayesian Netw ork (BN) is used to represent the conditional 
dependency between failure root causes.  
The gearbox to be modelled consists of three stages : two planetary and one parallel stage 
with helical gears. The load spectrum for failure d iagnosis to estimate the current damage and 
the load spectrum for failure prognosis to estimate  the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) are 
obtained through historical SCADA data and FASTv8 s imulation outputs, respectively.  
A vulnerability map of the gearbox has been generat ed to focus the computational efforts on 
the weakest gearbox parts which represent the healt h of the assembly. The fatigue damage is 
estimated by counting load cycles in bearings and g ears in conjunction with material S-N 
curves. The load cycles accumulated in the future f or prognosis purposes are estimated using 
a representative one-year load spectrum based on ou tputs from FAST simulations of the 
fatigue load cases described in IEC 61400-1/3.  
A gearbox failure investigation was performed to id entify the main sources of stress and 
vulnerable components. The author in [31] presents a detailed analysis of the design of a high-
speed gearbox for a 5MW baseline offshore wind turb ine. Wind turbine technical 
specification, environmental conditions, and load r esponse analysis are considered to define 
the vulnerability map of a 3-stage gearbox; two pla netary stages and one parallel stage, in 
Figure 51. High-Speed Shaft (HSS) bearings, second stage planet bearings, Low-Speed Shaft 
(LSS) sun gear and third stage gears are the most c ritical components in term of fatigue

gearbox are given in Table 36. Failure investigatio n shows that the high-speed shaft bearings 
are one of the gearbox components with a higher pro bability of fatigue damage.

Gearbox failure modes and causes are described in [ 95] [86]. The presence of foreign objects 
and manufacturing defects are identified as common failure causes. The author in [96] [87] 
states gearboxes have historically experienced fail ures in both planet and HSS bearings. The 
HSS bearings can be replaced on site. However, plan et bearings failures require the removal 
of the gearbox for it to be repaired at the port. F or that reason, the gearbox represents 25% 
of the maintenance cost.  
A comparative study between a 2MW 3-stage gearbox p rototype and gearbox model was 
performed in [97] [88]. The results of the tooth ro ot stress for both analyses show the highest 
values for contact and pitting stress are experienc ed in the HSS.  

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
115 In terms of consequences of failure related to the gearbox, the study in [35] [35] found that 
the HSS bearings and the 2 stage shaft and bearing failures could account for more than 50% 
of the total gearbox failure cost; see Table 37. 
This gearbox vulnerability map ranks the gearbox co mponents from highest to lowest fatigue 
damage. The gearbox vulnerability map and, conclusi ons of the literature review allow the 
most critical components within the gearbox to be i dentified: the high-speed shaft and second 
stage bearings and the sun gear of the first stage and the parallel gears of the high-speed 
shaft.

4.3.2 Physics-based model of the gearbox 
The gears, bearings, and shafts follow the design s tandard IEC 61400-4 described in [98] [89]. 
The general gearbox specifications are given in Tab le 38. The design lifetime is calculated, 
assuming that the turbine will be operating 60% of the time; it will have a capacity factor of 
60%.  Damage accumulation is calculated using the r espective S-N curves for all mechanical 
elements and each step of the load spectrum. The da mage is accumulated continually and 
transformed into a lifetime at the end of the analy sis. The analysis of the gears is according to 
DIN, ISO or AGMA standards, the analysis of the bea rings according to standard L10 calculation 
or DIN/ISO 281 [15].

Torque and shaft diameters are calculated as follow s [99] [90]: OWT with an electrical 
generator of 3.600 kW of power output. The low-spee d shaft (LSS) rotates at 12 rpm, and the 
high-speed shaft (HSS) rotates at 1600 rpm. Maximum  stress recommended for solid steel 
shafts available is 55MPa [12]. The gearbox efficie ncy at rated power is 0.94, and generator 
efficiency at rated power is 0.93. Using the termin ology described in table 39, the rotational 
speed (angular velocity) is calculated:

The diameter of the shafts to carry a given torque can be calculated by selecting a maximum 
shearing stress which will be allowed for a given s haft material. This stress take place at r=r 0. 
Based on [99] , the shearing stress in a solid shaf t is given by :

Where r is the distance from the axis of the shaft to point of maximum shearing stress and, J 
is the shaft’s polar moment of inertia. 
?=@>AB

Where r 0 is the shaft radius.  
The maximum stress is usually selected with a signi ficant safety factor (x2) for designing 
purposes. The shaft diameter to bear the maximum st ress is given by:

Where d HSS  and d LSS  are the diameter of the high and low speed shaft, respectively, k is equal 
to 1,22 for a shaft is fitted with a continuous lin er and is oil lubricated, su is the specified 
minimum tensile strength of the shaft material, in N/mm 2, P is the maximum shaft power in 
kW and R is the rotational speed in rpm. This equat ions disregard losses in gearboxes and 
bearings.  
The results are shown in Table 39. Both methods con cluded that the LSS diameter should be 
around 15cm and the LSS should have a diameter betw een 1.5m and 3m.  
 
The gearbox to be modelled consists of three stages : two planetary and one parallel stage 
gears. This detailed model of the gearbox is achiev ed by the use of the proprietary software 
Kisssys [101] [92], see Figure 52.

There is two parts of the remaining useful life (RU L) model as shown in Figure 50: i) prognostic 
model using one year historical SCADA data (Table 4 0) and ii) predictive model using 
simulations (FASTv8). Both cases will generate a lo ad spectrum of 19 torque bins as an input 
for the KISSsoft gearbox model defining frequencies  (sum of all frequencies = 1), the relative 
torque and rotational speed.  
 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
120 For each part of the load spectrum, the KISSsoft so ftware calculates the damage for all 
mechanical elements, using the respective S-N curve s. The damage is accumulated continually 
and being transformed into a lifetime according to DIN, ISO or AGMA standards for gears and 
according to standard L10 calculation or DIN/ISO 28 1 for bearings [102] [93]. The RUL of gears 
is calculated based on the theory that every load c ycle produces damage. The amount of 
damage depends on the stress level, and for lower s tress, the damage is considered null. 
Bending and pitting fatigue life of the gears is an  estimate based on the accumulation of 
discrete damage until failure occurs and using the load spectrum (derived from SCADA and 
FASTv8 simulations), material fatigue properties gi ven in the KISSsys gearbox model (S-N 
curves) and the damage accumulation method (Palmgre n-Miner rule) described in IEC 
standards [103] [94].

4.3.3 Physics-based model outputs: Gearbox 
The most vulnerable components in the gearbox that have been selected for further analysis 
are the HSS bearings. They are assigned as B1 and B 2 in Table 41. The method outlined in ISO 
281 for determining the bearing life assumes a cons tant load. However, methods have been 
proposed for determining the bearing life when the loading is fluctuating. For example, 
reference [104] [95] proposes a method for deriving  an equivalent mean constant load (from 
a fluctuating loading). Such a method is incorporat ed into the proprietary Kisssys [14] 
software. The damage is calculated for each torque bin in Table 40 and then added up to 
obtain the total damage done in 1 year (historical SCADA data). B1 shows 3.11% of damage or 
consumed lifetime and, B2 shows 3.45% of damage. As suming the load spectrum remains 
similar to the that shown in Table 40, and since th e data for this analysis was representative 
of one year's operation, the remaining useful life for B1 is 100 / 3.11 = 32 years approximately.

122 4.4 Power converter physics-based model 
Similar to the methodology proposed for the gearbox , a systematic physics-based method has 
been proposed to predict the damage accumulation of  power converter of offshore wind 
turbines. The approach was implemented using python  codes. The total fatigue life is 
calculated in two steps shown in Figure 53: 
• Historical estimation of pre-existing damage, accum ulated during operation (diagnosis 
model). 
• Future estimation of simulated accumulated damage ( predictive model). 
 
Figure 53. Power converter physics-based approach t o estimate accumulated damage. 
This section explains each block of the flow diagra m shown in Figure 54. The predictive model 
takes into account the thermal cycling in power ele ctronic components as the main source of 
stress in the predictive model.

4.4.1 Failure investigation of power converter 
An Isolated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) is very similar to a metal oxide semiconductor field 
effect transistor (MOSFET) driving a gate of a bipo lar junction transistor but with superior on-
state conductivity. The MOSFET has a gate that is v ery easy to drive, meaning that it is not 
drawing too much current. A fully rated power conve rter, or back to back converter comprises 
a rectifier (generator side, conversion of AC to DC ) and an inverter (grid side, conversion of 
DC to AC). These two independent systems are connec ted via a DC link to deal with different 
and incompatible electrical parameters such as freq uency voltage and short-circuit capacity. 
The power electronic converter has shown high failu re rates in the risk assessment, SCADA 
data analysis and literature review [105] [96]. Rel iability of power electronics is a critical and 
developing need for offshore wind farm operators; t he assessment is essential for design as 
well as for the lifetime extension which leads to a  reduction of energy cost [106] [97]. 
Damage accumulation or ageing of power converter mo dules is due mainly due to differing 
properties of adjacent materials, especially differ ent coefficients of thermal expansion of 
adjacent layers, see Figure 55. Bond wire lift-off and solder delamination have been identified 
as the main failure modes [107] [98].  Based on [10 8] [99], the main source of stress giving 
rise to failures of power electronic components is temperature cycling. Figure 56 shows that 
55% of the failure mechanisms are triggered by ther mal activity, followed by vibration with 
20%.

For this project, failure in the IGBTs and diodes o n both sides of the power converter due to 
thermal cycling represent the overall health of the  assembly. 
4.4.2 Induction generator model 
The details of the electrical drive to extract elec trical variables are not usually modelled in 
FAST; instead, the focus is on getting the torque-s peed curve correct, which effects turbine 
loads.  For an induction machine, the most sophisti cated built-in model available in FAST is 
the Thevenin-Equivalent Circuit (TEC) model. The an alysed turbine uses a squirrel cage 
induction generator (SCIG); therefore, a model to e xtract voltage and current variables are 
proposed to complement FAST simulations.  
SCIG is a three-phase induction machine and has thr ee windings in the stator and three 
windings more in the rotor, although, these can be imaginary.  Generators can be described 
with the same set of the equation than motors, see Figure 57. To simplify the equations, the 
following hypothesis is commonly used  [110] [101]: 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
125 • Symmetric and balanced three-phase induction machin e, with a single winding rotor 
(Squirrel cage simple) and constant gap.  
• The material is assumed to be linear, that is to sa y, the iron saturation is discarded. 
• The iron magnetic permeability is assumed to be inf inite in front of the air permeability, 
which means that the magnetic flux density is radia l to the gap. 
• All kind of losses in the iron are neglected. 
• Both the stator windings and the rotor windings rep resent distributed windings which 
always generate a sinusoidal magnetic field distrib ution in the gap

Where S is the complex power, P is electrical activ e power and Q is reactive power. 
4.4.3 Power losses calculation 
IGBT and Diode power losses can be divided into con duction losses (P c), switching losses (P sw ) 
and blocking (or leakage) losses (P b) which is normally neglected.  
Power 	losses PlPGm PnoPlPGm  (8) 
IGBT Conduction losses can be calculated as follow:

Where u CE0  is the DC voltage source, r c is the collector-emitter on-state resistance, i c is the 
collector current as shown in Figure 58.

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
127 The same approach can be used for the anti-parallel  diode: 
uuiu=uut +ruiu (10) 
The parameters r D and r C can be derived directly from the IGBT Datasheet (s ee Figure 59 and 
Figure 60). In order to take into account ambient a nd junction temperature changes in every 
simulation step, the u CE0  and u D0  values are read from the diagram as temperature de pendant 
extrapolating junction temperature values between 2 5 oC and 125 oC.

128 To describe the temperature dependency of the curve  for the conduction losses calculation 
in the IGBTs the coefficients (a=r c,b) can also be made temperature dependent [114] [1 05].

Therefore, the relationship between collector curre nt and voltage is given by:

With r c and r D derived from Figure 59 and Figure 60 are junction temperature dependent. 
Based on [112] [103], the switching losses in the I GBT and the diode are a product of switching 
energies and switching frequency (f sw ). This characteristic is given by manufacturers as  is 
shown in Figure 61. As current values would be vary ing due to a stochastic characteristic of 
the wind and turbulence intensity, the switching lo sses will be dependent on the input current 
using the slope in Figure 61 [115] [106]. 
 (14) 
Finally, the total power losses in the IGBT and the  diode can be expressed as the sum of the 
conduction and switching losses [109] [100][112] [1 03]:

4.4.4 Thermal model  
Power losses have to be conducted through the conne ction layers and insulation layers to the 
heat sink as it is shown in Figure 55. The heat dis sipation generated during forward on-state 
and blocking state and during switching is expresse d by the difference of temperatures 
between the layers described by the following equat ion:  
 (16) 
As mentioned before, different materials used durin g power converter module construction 
have different thermal expansion coefficients. This  feature of the physics is represented by 
the thermal resistance and thermal impedance of the  material which comprises geometry, 
conductivity and heat transfer area. The thermal re sistance can be calculated as follow: 
 (17) 
Where d is material thickness, λ is heat conductivi ty and A is heat flow area.

e2=∆I/ ∆E

130 Table 42. Material commonly used on power converter s [109] [100] . 
 
Similarly to an electrical circuit, the thermal mod el of the power converters can be expressed 
with an equivalent circuit as shown in Figure 62. H ere power loss is the input (representing 
the current in an electrical circuit), the differen ce in temperature is analogous to the drop in 
the electrical voltage and thermal resistance is an alogous to the electrical resistance. 
The temperature differences ΔT over the thermal res istances are calculated for constant 
power dissipation P T of the IGBT switches and Diodes inside the power m odule as follows: 
 (18) 
 
Figure 62. Static thermal model (R th ) without base plate [109] . 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
131 After losses have been calculated, the temperature during stationary operation can be 
calculated with the aid of thermal resistances R th , final values of the Z th  curve given by 
manufacturers (Figure 63).  
 
Figure 63. Transient thermal impedance [109,113] [100,104]  
Temperature calculation starts from the ambient tem perature T a outside to the inside as it is 
shown in Figure 64.  
When there is more than one heat source on the heat sink, all the sources are added up.  Each 
loss of electrical power in the electrical circuit represents a source of heat which is input to 
the heatsink. 
 
Figure 64. Temperature calculation process [109] [100] . 
T (s)  
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
132 For example, for a power converter with 6 IGBTs and  6 Diodes, the total loss is used to 
calculate the heatsink temperature, as follows:

Now the junction temperature T j for IGBTs and Diodes have been modified a new powe r loss 
has to be calculated as it is explained in Figure 6 5.  
 
Figure 65. Process to calculate temperatures incorp orating ambient temperature in each 
step [109] [100]  
Temperature fluctuations experienced by the interna l connections within the power modules 
produce ageing, through accumulating fatigue damage , caused by thermal stress cycles. As 
explained before, the fatigue of material is produc ed by thermal stress due to the different 
expansion coefficients of the connected materials o r adjacent layers. During normal operation 
at frequencies of few Hz and especially at duty cyc le operation, the internal connections of 
the layers in a power converter module will experie nce temperature cycling. At frequencies 
around 100Hz, the temperature variation (ΔT) is sma ll so low energy dissipation is 
counterbalanced by elastic deformation [109] [100].  Temperature variations have been 
measured and simulated in [116]; here the author sh ows two temperature oscillations 
superimposed. Once, the power modules are in stand by; the temperature is stabilized to 30 
oC and every 100 seconds, there is a rise in the tem perature of 50 oC. When the temperature 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
133 reaches the maximum, it is possible to see a higher  frequency variation in the temperature of 
320ms cycle time. The study concluded that one cycl e every 100s is most likely to damage the 
IGBTs.  
Rainflow counting method is applied to estimate the  frequency and amplitude ranges of the 
thermal cycles [108,117,118] [99,107,108]. The rain flow counting method is adapted from 
material science and applied to power electronics [ 118] [108]. This method identifies local 
highs and lows in the data as peaks and valleys whe re the range between them are all 
considered to be half cycles. The algorithm pairs t he half cycles to generate complete cycles 
regarding a mean [119] [109].  
A script for the ASTM E 1049-85 (2005) Rainflow Cou nting Method is used as a reference [120]

The proposed method to estimate the lifetime of pow er modules is based on Figure 66 which 
is provided by the manufacturer in [109] [100]. Onc e temperature cycles are counted using 
the rainflow counting method, temperature cycling a mplitude and the mean absolute 
junction temperature are calculated.  
In Figure 66, an initial point is selected using th e counted number of cycles and the calculated 
ΔT j. Then, the deference between final cycles to failu re for the estimated mean junction 
temperature curve (blue, green, etc.) at the calcul ated ΔT j and the initial point of a counted 
number of cycles would result in the remaining cycl es to failure.  
IGBTs and Diodes junction temperature time series a re separately analysed and then the 
lifetimes are combined using the Miner’s rule [106]  [97].  
A cross-multiplication (or rule of three)  between counted numbers of thermal cycles 
associated with a period of prediction (in minutes or hours) and the remaining cycles to failure 
would result in a predicted failure date.

The estimated damage for a period of two and half d ays is described in Table 43. Under these 
operational conditions, there is a total of 75,075 cycles and accumulated damage of 
0.00000143%. Since the damage of the power converte r is related to the number of cycles for 
a particular temperature range, It is possible to s ee that larger estimated damage is generated 
in the range between 9 and 12 degrees Celsius.

4.5 Conclusion  
Since statistical-based methods for O&M optimisatio n do not consider the actual condition of 
the component, failure date prediction can be at an y point in time. This might represent a 
greater consequential economic cost. Nowadays, data -driven approaches use operational 
data (CMS or SCADA) to understand the normal behavi our of critical assets or components. 
When a clear deviation from normal behaviour is ide ntified, a failure can be detected. The 
predictability of failure in the offshore wind indu stry is a combination of programming, 
statistics and subject matter expert knowledge. An inspection might detect a well-developed 
failure without leaving any time to respond in a co st-effective manner. Accumulated damage 
determination in the time domain using physics-base d models is discussed as one of the 
methodologies with greater capability to predict fa ilure far in advance, even from the 
installation date of the component.  
The patterns of seasonal variations can change year ly. The procedure described in this 
chapter allows observed load spectra to be used as inputs, enabling the estimated 
accumulated damage to be updated throughout the lif e of the component. The simulated 
spectra represent future loading scenarios and open  up the possibility of using the statistics 
of the wind climate.  
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
137 Based on the failure investigation and the vulnerab ility map of gears and bearings it is noted 
that bearing failures caused by fatigue damage occu rs on several of the shafts in the gearbox, 
but predominately in the HSS shaft bearings. HSS sh aft failures are responsible for 50% of the 
repair cost in the gearbox.  
The load distribution of the three-stage gearbox is  calculated using SCADA data and the 
model. The proposed physics-based model of the gear box helps to optimise O&M activities 
by feeding the RUL into the decision-making process  of wind farm operators. Around 3% of 
lifetime consumption is estimated in both HSS beari ngs, B1 and B2.  
A physics-based method to estimate damage accumulat ion of IGBTs and Diodes and to predict 
the RUL of power converters have been proposed. The  simulations do not require a large 
computational effort, therefore it is suitable for day-to-day use. The algorithm comprises one 
glue code and four main pre-processors; generator, power losses, thermal model and the 
rainbow counting method. The main inputs of the met hodology to estimate accumulated 
damage are the torque and rotational speed in the h igh-speed shaft. For prediction purposes, 
the proposed methodology is to calculate the torque  and rotational speed using the aero-
servo-elastic-hydro simulation tool FAST. FAST uses  as inputs the load cases derived from IEC 
standards representing all the operational conditio ns an offshore wind turbine may 
experience at a particular site. A period of two an d half days is simulated, which is not long 
enough to extrapolate the damage for the whole year  as it does not include all the operational 
conditions. The total number of thermal cycles is 7 5075 and represent very small accumulated 
damage, 1.44E-08%.  
The power losses and junction temperatures depend o n the ambient temperature. The power 
losses and thermal algorithms require information p rovided by the manufacturer.  
Similar to the gearbox, the RUL method of the power  converter could be used to inform 
maintenance decisions to optimise resource allocati on considering weather conditions 
throughout the year. Unexpected failures, which rep resent huge production losses, as well as 
time finding failures could be avoided by schedulin g maintenance or inspection activities 
based on the RUL estimation.

138 CHAPTER 5 – DATA MINING APPROACH FOR THE PITCH SYST EM 
5.1 introduction 
Automatic and intelligent systems are needed to min imise human intervention during the 
operating life. The pitch system has been identifie d as one of the most critical assemblies in 
terms of turbine operation. For the pitch system, t he limited number of signals available 
through the SCADA system obstructs the identificati on of failure causes, the development of 
physics-based approaches to quantify degradation, e stimate risk and hence schedule 
maintenance tasks.  It is clear however, that the h ealth of the pitch system may be discerned 
from the available data.  The challenge is to ident ify how to combine existing signals.  
Therefore, machine learning and data mining methodo logies have been used to understand 
the normal behaviour of the pitch system.  Observed  deviations from normal behaviour in 
SCADA data can be categorised as positive or negati ve in terms of the deduced risk profile.  
Consequently, critical modes of failure of the pitc h system have been anticipated in advance. 
The initial criteria to select data mining techniqu es for this project are: 
• Ease to understand the codes and interpret the outp uts: one of the requirements of 
the sponsor company is to propose a methodology sim ple to understand for both, the 
end user and the developer.   
• Cost effective with low computational effort:  A su per computer is no required and 
the implementation is done in the open source Pytho n code.  
• Unsupervised: taking into account the large amount of data and variables, the first 
step in this process is to identify how a turbine b ehaves under certain operational 
conditions without giving the model inputs.   
• Prediction capability: ideally, the proposed method ology needs to be able to diagnose 
and prognoses failures.  
Therefore, the methodology and process in this sect ion are based on simple and commonly 
used techniques of data mining. The implementation is made in python code.  
The proposed method involves an unsupervised one-cl ass Support Vector Machine (SVM), 
used for novelty detection.  Given a set of samples , the SVM detects the soft boundary of that 
dataset.  Many different variables may be incorpora ted into the analysis as inputs.  In two 
dimensions, the soft boundary can be displayed as a  contour.  A decision tree is used to take 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
139 into account expert knowledge of offshore wind turb ine technology and operation and to 
include more variables to the analysis in three dim ensions or more. Figure 69 shows the 
analysis of 1-year historical data of the wind spee d and blade position (2D) and, the addition 
of a third variable (3D), the oil pressure of the h ydraulic system to determine the failure mode. 
It is possible to associate points in the graph by the time stamp of the original dataset. The 
final frontier of normal operation is defined and a  status variable assigned to the training data 
(green, yellow, red).   
 
Figure 69. Three-dimensional analysis of the pitch system using one year of historical data. 
The classification technique used is the K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN).  KNN enables new SCADA 
data observations to be categorised and operation s tatus to be assigned.  The KNN model 
searches for a number of observations from the trai ning data and then calculates the 
numerical distance between the unknown “status” of the new observation and the training 
data.  Then the KNN model selects the nearest known  status for the new observation. This 
methodology is less computationally demanding and w ill allow pitch system anomalies to be 
identified.  More SCADA database variables can then  be included in the analysis of anomalies 
to diagnose the failure mode and cause.   
5.1.1 Pitch system technology 
Pitch systems can consist of electric or hydraulic power actuators. The generic offshore wind 
turbine of this project uses a hydraulic pitch syst em as it is shown in Figure 70.

5.1.2 Data mining approach objectives 
The structure of the data mining approach is shown in Figure 71. The general aim of this 
section is to design and deploy data mining approac hes to diagnose failures in the pitch 
system of an offshore wind turbine as early as poss ible. The specific objectives are: 
• To understand failure modes and causes of the pitch  system and their correlation with 
the available data of the SCADA system. 
• To identify normal behaviour and the learnt frontie r using an unsupervised Support 
Vector Machine (SVM) technique. 
• To combine Subject Matter Expert Knowledge (SMEK) w ith SCADA data and the learnt 
frontier to assign a risk status to the training da ta. 
• To develop a K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) technique t o assess new observations or 
data points based on the created risk status.

5.2 Data analysis 
The data mining process and analysis is performed u sing a python code and its machine learning and 
data analysis tool, scikit-learn. This tool is sele cted due to it is open source, commercially usable and 
built-in commonly known python libraries; NumPy, Sc iPy, and matplotlib.  
5.2.1 Data mining process 
This section describes a combination of machine lea rning techniques which is used in the 
literature as a hybrid classifier. Commonly, SVM an d KNN are used together to reduce 
misclassifications. As one of the main objectives o f the data mining approach is to incorporate 
subject matter expert knowledge into the model, the  unsupervised SVM technique is used to 
identify boundaries and understand turbine behaviou r. The proposed data mining process 
used in this project is described below:  
1.  Wind turbine and pitch system understanding: First,  it is necessary to understand the 
objectives clearly and identify what are the potent ial failure modes of the pitch 
system.  
2.  To identify data variables in the SCADA system asso ciated with the pitch system 
failures.  

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
142 3.  To select data mining techniques, assumptions, and constraints.  
4.  SCADA data understanding (data exploration): This s tep comprises data collection, 
including data load and data integration. Next, dat a exploration is performed using 
visualisation and Pearson correlation coefficient t o identify patterns based on the 
wind turbine understanding. Then, it is necessary t o identify if there is any missing 
value in the acquired data.  
5.  Data preparation: This step aims to prepare the fin al data set. The data identified 
needs to be formatted into a .csv format to be read  by the python code.  
6.  Modelling: Data mining techniques are selected to b e used for the prepared dataset. 
5.2.2 SCADA data analysis 
There are systems in the offshore wind turbine that  have limited access or their knowledge 
about the multiple dynamic interactions between the ir subsystems does not exist. The SCADA 
database is already available and provides a large amount of operational data that can be 
used to give an indication of the health of the sys tem. The information in the SCADA system 
varies from status signals to measurement signals s uch as wind speed, temperatures, 
pressures, voltages, currents, blade position, etc.  [122] [112].  
The normal behaviour of systems and changes or devi ations from normal behaviour can be 
detected in an early stage of failure using sophist icated signal analysis techniques. Normal 
behaviour is established using two input signals fr om historical operational data during 
periods where the turbine is normally operating. Co rrelation of signals is studied to identify 
those that once are combined they can indicate the system condition. Table 44 shows the 
results of the Pearson’s correlation coefficient te st between several SCADA database 
variables related to the pitch system. The Pearson correlation coefficient is a simple linear 
analysis. This analysis quantifies the linear relat ionship between two variables (X and Y), with 
a series of pairs x i and y i ,with i: 1,2,…n. It varies between +1 and −1 where:  
• 1 is total positive linear correlation. 
• 0 is no linear correlation. 
• −1 is total negative linear correlation.  
The Pearson’s coefficient r xy  is calculated as follows [123] [113]: 
 =∑ ̅     ¡
¢  1  
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
143 Where, ̅ and   ¡ are the mean values of X and Y and, s x and s y are the standard deviation of X 
and Y.  
Table 44. Pearson correlation coefficient. 
 
Table 44 analyses several SCADA variables: wind spe ed, rotational speed, yaw and blade 
position and, hydraulic system pressure. As it is e xpected, there is a clear positive linear 
correlation between wind speed and rotational speed . But also, it is possible to see in the 
table a strong negative linear correlation between blade position and rotational speed and, 
between oil pressure and blade position.  
Likewise, Figure 72 visually explores the correlati on between turbulence intensity and blade 
position, wind speed and oil pressure. The turbulen ce intensity is derived from SCADA data 
by dividing the standard deviation of 10 minutes wi nd speeds series by the mean wind speed. 
The scatter plots in Figure 72 shows variables of a  turbine with pitch system failures. The 
failure was registered and reported on a specific d ate by the O&M team of a specific offshore 
wind farm. SCADA data from 6 months before the fail ure and 6 months after the failure was 
selected. It is possible to visually inspect the da taset and identify where most of the points 
are and if there is any outstanding outlier point.

Figure 72. Turbine with pitch system failure 
 
 
In order to understand turbine behaviour is necessa ry to cross two data sources: SCADA data 
and maintenance logs. Using maintenance logs and ma intenance team reports, it is possible 
to identify specifics dates of failures of a specif ic turbine in the wind farm. Therefore, the time 
variable and turbine ID are used to cross or correl ate both sources of information: 
maintenance logs and SCADA data. The proposed appro ach is shown in Figure 73. The flow 
diagram shows the reasoning behind the process. Ana lysing the O&M reports it is possible to 
extract failure mode, date and turbine ID. When the  failure mode is related to the pitch 
system, the proper SCADA data variables are selecte d for the period of time before the 
identified date of failure.

5.2.3 Failure investigation outputs 
Failure investigation is crucial to understand patt erns in SCADA data. First, using the approach 
described in Figure 73, it is possible to explore S CADA data before a pitch system failure 
occurs. Figure 74 shows a comparison of 1-year SCAD A data between a turbine with a 
registered pitch system failure and a healthy turbi ne. It is possible to see that the turbine with 
a known pitch system failure experienced approximat ely 10% higher frequency of turbulence 
intensity during one year before the failure date.  

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
146  
Figure 74. Comparison between healthy turbine and t urbine with pitch system failure. 
Hydraulic actuators modify the blade pitch or angle  during the hydraulic pitch system 
operation. A hydraulic pump and a pressurised tank providing back up, constantly run to 
maintain pressure. Springs are used to securing ope ration safety since, in case of a failure, the 
blade will pitch to a safe position. Maintenance ac tivities of hydraulic systems mainly involve 
regular checks for leaks of fluid and to ensure tha t there is no excessive play in the 
mechanisms. The pitch system accounts for 20% of th e total turbine downtime. Hydraulic 
pitch systems might present failure modes such as l eakage, contamination, component 
malfunction and electrical faults. Proportional val ve leakage is identified as the main failure 
mode of hydraulic pitch systems [121] [111]. 
The author in [124] [114] identifies that states in  the control system represent potential 
failures of the active control power system. The mo st common states are:  

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
147 • Fault blade load control: this state means that an undue effort was exercised in the 
blade, the turbine is still operating but with redu ced power and the maintenance 
service needs to rectify the failure.  
• Pitch control error: a difference of the angles of the three blades, which leads to the 
turbine shutdown. The turbine restarts automaticall y for a number of times before 
the maintenance service is required.  
 
The main outputs of the failure investigation based  on SCADA data analysis, O&M information 
and literature review, are encoder error, hydraulic  system failure, valve failure and actuator 
failure, Figure 75. The maintenance reports after f ailure and SCADA data analysis described a 
generic hydraulic system failure, but non or limite d information about the repair actions is 
provided. On the other hand, in the literature revi ew, the most common failure of the 
hydraulic pitch system are described. These failure s are linked with SCADA data variables such 
as oil pressure, blade position and wind speed. 
 
 
Figure 75. Main findings of the failure investigati on. 
5.3 Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
Due to the design understanding of the relationship  of the blade position and wind speed and, 
the correlation of these variables with the failure  modes of the hydraulic pitch system; the 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
148 variables to be used in the SVM techniques are the wind speed and the blade position as it is 
shown in Figure 77.  
SVM has been used for data pattern recognition, cla ssification, regression and outliers 
detection since 1995. The main idea of SVM is to ma p the input vectors not linearly separable 
like in Figure 76 (a) into a higher dimensional fea ture space to use hyperplanes for optimal 
separation of mapped data like in Figure 76 (b)  [1 6].  
  
a) vector linearly separable b) Linearly separable data in feature space with hyperplane 
Figure 76. SVM data separation with feature space  [16]. 
Support vectors are the data points of observations  of SCADA data nearest to the defined 
hyperplane. Therefore, these points are critical el ements of the data set. The further the data 
points are from the hyperplane, the more confidence  there is that the points are classified 
correctly. The hyperplane can be found by calculati ng the distance to the nearest data points, 
known as the margin in Figure 76 (a). The main idea  is to select the greatest margin possible. 
In order to classify the dataset that is no clearly  separable, it is necessary to move from 2D to 
3D, this process of moving the data to a higher dim ension is called kernelling [125] [115]. 
There are several kernel functions: linear, nonline ar, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), 
and sigmoid. The only kernel function that does not  require prior knowledge of the data is 
RBF.  
As it is described in section 5.1, this step of the  process is unsupervised or without entering 
the knowledge of the data, therefore, the kernel fu nction selected for this study is RBF which 
is an exponential function: 
RBF = exp	 ¤	  ¥ , where y is the radio greater than 0 of the closed  ball centred at 
x’ in a graph. 
Margins  
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
149 The main advantages and disadvantages of SVM techni que is shown in Table 45. 
Table 45. SVM advantages and disadvantages [126] [1 16] 
Advantages Disadvantages 
Effective in high dimensional spaces Kernel function choosing is crucial when 
the number of features is greater than the 
number of samples 
Effective when the number of dimensions is 
greater than the number of samples It does not provide probability estimates 
directly (probability can be derived using a 
five-fold cross-validation) 
Memory efficient as it uses a subset of 
training points (support vectors)  
The decision functions are versatile as it can 
be defined by different Kernel functions  
 
Figure 77 shows the main output of the SMV with an exponential kernel function, RBF with a 
gamma of 0.01 . One year historical SCADA data is u sed to asses the methodology. The main 
frontier or contour is used to understand turbine n ormal behaviour in combination with 
subject matter expert knowledge, presented in the f ollowing section. The contour is called 
learn frontier.

150 5.4 Decision Tree Algorithm (DTA) 
After the learnt frontier in Figure 77 is defined, it is necessary to combine it with technical 
knowledge of the offshore wind turbine. Now, the me thodology and analysis become three-
dimensional. Thus, the graph in Figure 77 (wind spe ed v/s blade position) is divided and 
analysed in the main sections, as it is shown in Fi gure 78.  These sections are selected 
identifying the main concentration of points from S VM output. Then, using subject matter 
expert knowledge, each sections is analysed correla ted to a normal or abnormal behaviour 
based on the original design of the turbine compone nts and control system.  The sections and 
their correlation with the behaviour oif the turbin e is used in the decision trees methodology.  
 
Figure 78. SVM output analysis. 
A decision tree algorithm (DTA) is developed to ass ign a status to the points of the training 
data in each section of the graph, an example of th e flow diagram of the DTA is shown in 
Figure 79. Green status is normal behaviour, yellow  status is abnormal behaviour and red 
status is a failure. The DTA comprises subject matt er expert knowledge to interrogate the 
data intelligently.  

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
151  
Figure 79. Decision tree to assign a status vector to the training data. 
 
Some of the considerations (subject matter expert k nowledge) for this process are: 
• There is normally a phase in the start-up where the  turbine will wait at ~30deg pitch 
before deciding whether to go ahead with starting u p.  
• 12 m/s rated wind speed 
• From 12-24m/s – pitch control strategy 
• From 0-11m/s – torque control strategy  
• Pitch angle - 00° - low wind speed, pre-cut-in 
• Pitch angle - 80° - high wind speed cut-out 
• Dynamic behaviour, 10min average values is much tim e. The turbine could be shutting 
down during this time. Observations or data points in the “transition” areas need to 
be analysed further, including the time variable. 
• The system works against springs that, in case of a  failure, will pitch the blade to a safe 
position. 
• The difference in the angles of the blades leads to  shut down the turbine. 
• A hydraulic pump constantly runs to maintain pressu re (200 (bar)), with a pressurised 
tank providing back-up. 
• It is also possible to create lookup tables to inco rporate the relationship between 
variables and methodologies used in control system strategies as it is presented in  

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

Figure 80. Wind turbine variables relationship  [40 ]. 
To manage the large amount of data, a python code o f the DTA is developed in this project. 
The output of the DTA is a new status vector, which  is added to the original training data as it 
is shown in Table 46. 
Table 46. New dataset with the status vector. 
 
 
5.5 K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) 
Once the status vector is assigned to the training data, the process requires a simple and fast 
assessment of the new observations. Additionally, t his step needs to comprise a low 
computational effort. KNN is selected due to it is easy to interpret outputs, it has short 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
153 calculation and simulation time and, it has the pre diction capability. Once, the training data 
and the status vector is created in Table 46, new d ata points are assessed using the KNN 
technique. This KNN is a two-dimensional (2D in Fig ure 69) process, analysing only wind speed 
and blade position points to identify anomalies tha t might represent failures in the pitch 
system.   
The principle of the KNN technique is to find a num ber of training data points or predefined 
samples and estimate the closest distance to the ne w observation and assign a status label 
such as green, yellow or red. The distance can be a ny metric measure such as any standard 
Euclidean distance.

This method is known as non-generalizing machine le arning method as it simply remembers 
all the training data with a fast indexing structur e in Python [126] [116].  
The “K” is the number of neighbours that are used t o assess the status of the new observation. 
For example: in Figure 81, the new observation (e.g . wind speed vs blade position) is the blue 
point; red, yellow and green points are the trainin g dataset with a pre-assigned status (green, 
yellow and red); the number of neighbours to be ana lysed is K = 5; and the dashed blue circle 
with the blue point as a centre encloses the five d ata points on the plane. Four out of five 
points are red therefore the new observation status  is assigned red.  
 
Figure 81. KNN example. 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
154 The optimal selection of the value K is highly depe ndent on the data, a larger K-value would 
reduce the effects of noise. However, it would make  the classification boundaries less distinct 
[126] [116]. 
Usually, the nearest neighbours’ classification met hod uses uniform weights, which means 
that the value assigned to a new observation is cal culated from a simple common election of 
the nearest neighbours. In this study, due to the u nknown behaviour of the pitch system, it is 
better to assign weights to the neighbours based on  proximity. In other words, the nearest 
neighbours contribute more to the status selection.  The variable weights = 'distance' in Figure 
82, assigns weights proportional to the inverse of the distance from the new observation 
[126] [116]. 
5.6 Data mining approach outputs 
The main output of the KNN technique is shown in Fi gure 82. The 3-class classification is 
performed using a K-value of 10 and assigning weigh ts to the proximity of neighbours to the 
new observation. Green areas represent the normal b ehaviour of the pitch system; yellow 
areas represent potential failure events or compone nt (variable) transition from one state to 
another. Finally, red areas represent anomalies in one or two variables, a failure in the 
hydraulic pitch system (e.g. low oil pressure < 200  (bar)). The background colour tells what 
the predicted response value (status) would be. The  KNN method with the new status vector 
is applied to 1 year SCADA data of a turbine with a  failure in the pitch system known in the 
wind farm maintenance logs. Before 17 days, the win d speed is less than 5 m/s and the blade 
angle registered in SCADA is around -0.9 degrees (F igure 82-A). During the day 17, an angle of 
50 degrees is identified with a wind speed of 2.9 m /s (Figure 82-B), which is detected as red 
status (2) by KNN algorithm. In day number 22, the oil pressure decreased from an average 
of 208 bar to an average of 123 bar. The wind speed  and blade angle associated with this 
event are detected by the method (Figure 82-C). Fin ally, figure 82 D and E shows the 
simulation of 6 months and one year, respectively. The new data points with low pressure or 
abnormal behaviour defined in the DTA were located near neighbours with yellow and red 
status.

156 5.7 Conclusion  
The pitch system failure modes and causes represent ing the overall condition were identified 
in the literature review. External leakage due to w ear in the seals between the actuator rod 
and the cylinder, hydraulic supply line failure, va lve connection failure, and internal leakage 
due to the wear of the piston seal are the most com mon failures. The development of 
algorithms representing the physics of failure usin g the SCADA data available is challenging. 
The SVM technique is applied to determine the norma l behaviour of a known healthy turbine. 
This algorithm delivered a learn frontier boundary which was analysed to establish the normal 
behaviour. However, the uncertainty accompanying th e outputs is not calculated.  The learnt 
frontier shows areas in the relationship between wi nd speed and blade position that are 
understandable only knowing the control philosophy of the turbine.  
Subject matter expert knowledge of the offshore win d turbine is required to analyse the 
learnt frontier and assign conditions status to the  variables pair. A decision tree algorithm is 
proposed to analyse the data based on the learnt fr ontier. The data is analysed in sections of 
the wind speed and blade position and interrogated using more variables; oil pressure and 
power output. These sections (e.g. 0-5m/s of wind s peed and 0-10 degrees of blade position) 
may be reduced to improve the resolution of the ana lysis. The training data is 1 year of SCADA 
data. Each dataset point (wind speed, blade positio n) is interrogated by the decision tree and 
assigned a status value green if it is normal, yell ow if it is abnormal and red if it is a failure.  
The accuracy of this approach may be calculated by validating the model using historical 
SCADA data and maintenance logs with pitch system f ailures.  
The final step of the proposed methodology is to in terrogate new observations in real time 
using the KNN techniques. The KNN algorithm will us e the training data with the status vector 
to assign a status to the new observation (wind spe ed and blade position). The main 
advantages of this approach are that it needs only two variables to detect abnormal 
behaviour. Therefore, it requires less computationa l effort and it is straightforward to 
implement. The accuracy of the KNN method also need s to be refined  using more than one-
year historical SCADA data for several turbines ope rating in different operational conditions.  
Even though, data mining is a tool widely used in O &M of offshore wind farms, the 
combination of the decision tree and KNN methodolog ies is a novel alternative that allows

158 CHAPTER 6  - O&M COST MODEL  
6.1 Introduction  
The O&M cost model is the final step in this projec t. It integrates the FMEA, physics-based 
models and data mining technique outputs to estimat e availability and maintenance costs of 
a particular turbine in a specific location. Figure  83 shows the whole process to optimise 
O&M; the tools developed in previous chapters and t he cost model, potential improvements 
for operators and, the main source of uncertainties . Profit maximisation comes from three 
different sources: improvements of turbine availabi lity, reduction of maintenance costs and 
from, mean waiting time (due to logistics and weath er) reduction.. The investment in 
maintenance efforts impacts the availability of the  turbine and reduces the indirect cost of 
loss of revenue. The cost of maintenance increases exponentially near 100% availability 
(Figure 89). Knowing that there is a trade-off betw een turbine availability and maintenance 
cost, reaching an optimum at around 95% based on th e SPARTA project outputs the O&M 
optimisation relays on the optimal maintenance stra tegy identification. This is an optimal 
combination of preventive, predictive and correctiv e strategy. Turbine reliability and 
meteorological conditions are identified as the mai n source of uncertainties. However, failure 
prognosis and data mining also comprise probabiliti es and assumptions that need to be taken 
into account.

6.1.2 Objectives 
The O&M cost model can assist owners and operators of offshore wind farms to better 
estimate and control the costs of offshore wind far ms integrating the approaches described 
in previous chapters. The final objective of this t ool is to be a decision support system, a 
computer algorithm that analyses the measured data and visualises it in order to support the 
decision-making process.  
Since O&M costs are driven by mainly unexpected fai lures and corrective maintenance [118], 
the task is to predict with greater accuracy if fai lures will occur, how many and what costs are 
associated with these failures on the short, medium  and longer term. An O&M cost model 
uses the experience and data from the offshore wind  farm as well as physics-based models, 
probabilistic models and data mining models to diag nose and predict accumulated damage 
and then, to update the cost estimates during the o perating life.  
The specific objectives are: 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
160 • To develop two maintenance strategies. First, an O& M strategy without failure 
prognosis outputs and second, an O&M strategy incor porating the physics-based 
models and probabilistic approaches to failure diag nosis and prognosis.  
• To estimate the logistic delay time. 
• To estimate the downtime of the turbine. 
• To estimate the loss of production in kWh and monet ary loss  
• To estimate the turbine availability. 
• To estimate the cost of repair including labour and  vessels cost. 
• To estimate hidden CO 2 emissions. Offshore wind farms comprise hundreds o f 
turbines and the trend indicates that the number wi ll increase in the future, therefore, 
the CO 2 emissions of vessels need to be considered into th e decision-making process 
of operators during the project life cycle [1] [1] [127] [117].  
6.1.3 O&M cost model outline 
The process to include and compute the inputs and p artial outputs are described in Figure 84. 
The O&M model was wholly implemented in Microsoft E xcel. As the data that was used comes 
from different sources, the model will have input b locks to define and modify the original 
inputs. The input blocks are shown in yellow in the  O&M cost model outline: 
• Input block 1 – Maintenance classes: All maintenanc e actions, equipment, costs and 
logistics information for each failure mode are cla ssified. O&M resources: labour, crew 
transport strategy, spare parts logistics, etc. 
• Input block 2 – Wind turbine database: the FMEA is the basis to create the wind 
turbine database. Turbine breakdown model at a comp onent level, critical assemblies 
regarding risk to the operation, component IDs and manufacturer, installation date, 
failure modes and causes. It also comprises the mai ntenance class per failure to 
include information such as repair equipment, MTTR,  number of technicians to repair, 
repair actions, spare part availability.  
• Input block 3 – Digital sensors: these inputs come from the previous chapters of 
physics-based models for the gearbox and power conv erter and, data mining 
approach for the pitch system. Physics-based failur e predictions estimate the 
accumulated damage per assembly per turbine, remain ing useful life and estimated 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
161 failure date. Data mining tool gives an indication when failure starts. The data mining 
model provides failure diagnosis with an alarm with  low, medium and high failure risk. 
• Input block 4 – Power output: wind probability dist ribution of the site derived from 
SCADA and, the power curve of the turbine Siemens S WT3.6MW-120.  
• Input block 5 – Wind farm information: Wind farm ch aracteristics: layout, distance 
from the port, inter-turbine distances, number of t urbines and, turbine location, etc. 
This block will allow estimating of travels times, fuel consumption, CO 2 emissions and 
so on.  
• Input block 6 – Meteorological simulation: wave hei ght, wind speed and direction, 
lightening, visibility, safety thresholds. The fina l output is the mean delay time in days 
per month.  
• Input block 7 – O&M Strategy: selection of maintena nce activities and intervals based 
on failure rates and criticality of the components,  condition monitoring system and 
digital sensors.  
• Input block 8 – O&M information: information relate d to the O&M strategy and the 
wind farm characteristics such as number and type o f vessels and, number and shift 
of technicians.  
• Input block 9 – Economic parameter prediction: fuel  cost, spare part cost, labour cost 
and electricity sales price. 
Results of the O&M cost model  
The main outputs of the O&M cost model are time-var ying cost estimations, green blocks 
(input and outputs) and pink bubbles (maintenance s trategies) in Figure 84. 
o Optimal maintenance strategy selection. Three types  of maintenance are 
considered (Figure 87): Annual time-based maintenan ce, condition-based 
maintenance including digital sensors, risk-based m aintenance and 
unscheduled maintenance.  
o Turbine downtime and availability, loss of producti on, revenue losses, cost of 
repair and CO 2 emissions.

6.2  O&M of offshore wind farms  
The O&M optimisation of offshore wind farms is inte grated into the asset management 
framework proposed by Lloyd’s Register shown in Fig ure 85. The flow diagram describes the 
process that needs to be taken to performed asset i ntegrity service of offshore wind farms. 
The figure identifies three key phases: integrity g oals definition, risk understanding and risk 
management. O&M optimisation factors such as FMEA, strategy, condition monitoring etc. 
can be identified in all the three key phases.

Figure 85. Asset integrity management of offshore w ind turbines. 
The analysis of market segmentation and market stra tegy allows the identification of the 
requirements for the asset management tool and, the refore for O&M optimisation. The main 
drives of asset management are:  
• To understand offshore turbine operation under cert ain conditions 
• To understand failure mechanisms in order to design  a preventive maintenance 
strategy 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
164 • To identify hidden failure to reduce downtime and u nscheduled maintenance 
activities 
• To optimise O&M resources such as vessels, technici ans, ports, spare parts and 
equipment.  
6.2.1 Key offshore wind energy O&M market trends 
 
Based on previous studies [128] [118]  [129] [119]  [130] [120]  and [131] [121] , key offshore 
wind energy market trends are identified and used a s a reference to develop the O&M cost 
model: 
• Average OPEX of a typical offshore wind turbine is £70,000/MW/year.: “The estimated 
OPEX for a typical offshore wind turbine ranges fro m £60,000 / MW/year (E&Y, 2009) to 
£87,500 /MW/year (BVG Associates, 2012). These figu res do not include leases paid to 
The Crown Estate (TCE), Transmission Network Use of  System (TNUoS) charges or 
operational insurance premiums” [128] [118] .  
• Catapult 2015. Studies suggest that the cost of O&M  represent between 15% and 30% of 
the LCOE [128] [118] .  
• Reliability target of main components: O&M products  need to focus on increasing 
reliability and availability to maximise energy pro duction or to the minimise levelised cost 
of energy (LCOE). 
• Offshore wind farms out of the warranty period (~27 00 turbines in 2020 in Europe): 
offshore wind farm operators or asset owners have t o use a tool to optimise O&M.  
• Unscheduled maintenance activities represent an imp ortant percentage of O&M 
resources. Based on the SCADA data analysis,unsched uled maintenance hours can reach 
40% of the total time of maintenance.  Additionally , 21% of the total time is recorded as 
a fault-finding maintenance activity [130] [120] .  
• The reduction of unscheduled maintenance tasks migh t be accelerated by implementing 
an integral O&M approach considering the risk to th e operation, failure prognosis, 
weather forecasting and financial models.  
• A lack of effective interpretation of data increase s reactive activities and therefore, the 
cost of O&M. 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
165 • O&M activities represent between 15% to 30% of the LCOE and 60% of the OPEX [131] 
[121] . 
• The OPEX breakdown is described in the following ta ble [129] [119] : 
 
Table 47. OpEx breakdown[129] [119].

• When estimating the costs of O&M of offshore wind f arms, maintenance costs can be 
categorised as follows: 
 Costs of unscheduled maintenance to repair failures  
 Costs of scheduled preventive maintenance activitie s 
 Costs of scheduled major replacements of the wind t urbine. Major 
replacement activities need to be included in the c ost model as they affect 
the component or assembly reliability and therefore  the maintenance cost 
estimation.  
6.2.2 O&M logistics 
Based on the reports [128] [118][129] [119][132] [122][133] [123] , a typical maintenance 
team and logistics are described in Figure 86.  
The distance from the port, port facilities and wea ther conditions at the location govern the 
O&M logistic strategy [132] [122] . Commonly there are three options: 
• Port-based work boats; 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
166 • Port-based work boats plus helicopter support;  
• Fixed or floating offshore base (e.g. ‘motherships’ ). 
Table 48 describes different scenarios for the util isation of different vessels.

including remote monitoring, port facilities manage ment, vessels for crew transfer and 
electricity sales. 
• Monitor & control the turbines 
• Monitor & control the HV and auxiliary systems 
• Control the turbines, HV systems and BOP to facilit ate maintenance & repair activities 
Maintenance takes into account all the actions requ ired to efficiently run turbines and 
balance of plant. The balance of plant comprises al l infrastructural and facilities of an offshore 
windfarm with the exception of the turbine and all its elements. The balance of plant 
therefore mainly comprises of the following items. 
• Crane pads/ Hard standings 
• Foundations 
• Substation Civil and Electrical 
• Road upgrades and Construction 
• Cabling to substation and Grid 
• SCADA 
• Transformers 
• Miscellaneous Costs 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
168 Maintenance comprises preventive (scheduled) and co rrective (unscheduled) activities of 
repair and inspections. See Figure 87. 
 
Figure 87. Maintenance strategies. 
6.2.3 Spare part management 
As described in the literature review, spare part m anagement is a crucial part of O&M 
optimization. It accounts for a range between 8.3% and 16.7% of the total O&M costs [68] 
[65] . The positive impacts that are identified in spare  part logistics improvements are offshore 
turbine downtime reduction, reduction of the value of the spare part in inventory and, spare 
part availability improvements. 
The key performance indicators that depend on effec tive spare part management are: 
• Unscheduled downtime 
• Spare part availability 
• Inventory management 
• Response time 
• Abortive work, parts delayed

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
169 Based on [134] [124] , 70% of the time the spare part is available in th e local depot which 
represents no delay in the O&M logistics, 25% of th e time the spare part is available in another 
depot which represents 1 day of delay and, 5% of th e time the spare part is not available and 
need to be ordered with the manufacturer which can represent until 7 days of logistics delay 
time.  
6.3  O&M optimization  overview  
An offshore wind turbine has thousands of component s; each of them may fail in different 
ways. Figure 88 shows a holistic view of the progno sis and diagnosis of failure modes and their 
impact on the O&M strategy. Different failure modes , failure mode 1, 2 and 3 in the figure, 
have a different mean time to repair (MTTR) and con sequently different turbine downtime. 
There are several ways to predict and diagnose fail ure modes and they have different 
technical and economic implications. For example, t he statistical-based approach is 
inexpensive. However, it is only able to predict fa ilure events after they occur. Inspections are 
quite reliable, but they can only detect a failure when it is already advanced. New condition 
monitoring systems are more accurate for failure pr ognosis and allow more time to plan 
maintenance activities before failure, however; the y might also reduce or degrade turbine 
reliability with the incorporation of more systems.  Data mining and physics-based models are 
inexpensive and have the capability to diagnose and  predict failures; nevertheless, they 
require considerable engineering effort and validat ion.   
Figure 88 gives an example of the O&M optimisation challenge. It correlates failure modes 
with access windows and maintenance strategies. For  example, access windows are defined 
using the significant wave height under a certain s afety threshold for a specified period. The 
planned maintenance activities are already set for the whole period. Failure mode 1 occurs 
during a no-access period; therefore, it will compr ise loss of production and potential 
consequential damage of other components. Choosing one of the failure prognosis and 
diagnosis techniques with enough time in advance, f ailure mode 1 might be avoided if it is 
included in planned maintenance 2.  
 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
170  
Figure 88. Prediction of accumulated damage techniq ues, accessibility and O&M strategy. 
 
There is a trade-off between O&M cost reduction and  availability improvement. Figure 89 
shows qualitatively that after a certain point of a vailability improvement or maintenance 
effort, the cost of maintenance starts rising again . The direct cost of O&M such as vessels, 
spare part and technicians increases exponentially with maintenance efforts to improve 
availability. The indirect costs, such as loss of p roduction, decrease linearly with the 
maintenance efforts. Therefore, based on [123] ther e is a point in the graph around 95% 
availability where the cost of O&M starts increasin g again.  
Turbine availability depends on wind farm character istics such as turbine location and turbine 
age. The report in [135] [125] shows that availabil ity improves with age and decreases with 
the distance to the port.

age [117].  
To optimise O&M, it is necessary to predict a failu re and access window far enough in 
advance. The necessary resources to repair a failur e will depend on the wind farm and turbine 
characteristics. Logistical delay time improvements  will also contribute to optimise O&M by 
reducing the waiting time for technicians and spare  parts.   
6.4 O&M cost model  
6.4.1 General description  
This cost model is based on the methodology propose d in [136] [126]  and developed in 
Microsoft Excel using a fictitious offshore wind fa rm with 24 turbines. The O&M cost model 
includes a wind farm model with actual specific win d farm data, and damage accumulation 
algorithm (time-dependent variable) for each turbin e in the offshore wind farm.  
In case of a failure event, the next process is ado pted for this cost model: 
1.  Alarm will be notified (operation office) 
2.  The operator needs to decide between the following:  
a.  Turbine can be restarted remotely without a visit t o the turbine 
b.  A visit is required to determine whether the turbin e can be restarted without 
maintenance or whether maintenance activities are r equired first.  

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
172 3.  Operator organise repair actions 
4.  Time to Repair (TTR) is divided into the following periods: 
a.  Logistics time: crew, spare part and equipment are ready to depart. 
b.  Waiting time: period of time that the weather does not allow safe access to 
the turbine. 
c.  Transit time: travel time from port to the turbine.  
d.  Repair time: the time needed to repair the failure.  
e.  Return time: travel time to return to port. 
 
6.4.2 Maintenance classes, repair actions and spare  part availability 
Maintenance classes are crucial for the development  of this O&M cost model. They are 
assigned to every single failure mode identified in  the FMEA to correlate the failures with 
costs and resources necessary to repair them, as we ll as the logistic delay time.  
Each failure mode and its associated repair actions  are classified based on repair actions, crew 
and equipment required to repair. The maintenance c lasses are defined in Table 49 and Table 
50 based on studies in [137] [127], [136] [126] and  Lloyd’s Register experience with offshore 
wind farm operators.

It is also necessary to describe how the repair is going to be carried out and how the 
equipment is going to be used. This process is used  to estimate the time to repair a failure in 
the maintenance classes. An example of this process  for maintenance class B is shown in Table 
51.

175 6.4.3 Wind turbine database 
The wind turbine database comprises information for  all the turbines in the offshore wind 
farm. It contains the location of each turbine and a comprehensive hierarchical breakdown of 
components of each turbine based on the FMEA previo usly developed.  The FMEA is the base 
of the wind turbine database. The information per c omponent is complemented with 
operation data such as installation date and manufa cturer per component, maintenance class 
per failure mode, turbine ID and SCADA systems dete ction methods. An example of the 
database spreadsheet for each wind turbine in the w ind farm is given in Figure 90.  
 
Figure 90. Example of the wind turbine database.  
The failure rate is assigned to each failure mode a nd cause using the occurrence rating which 
was defined using operation data and offshore wind farm operators experience. The failure 
frequency in Table 52 is given by technicians of an  offshore wind farm.

The wind turbine database will be used to stablish the O&M strategy by selecting those 
failures and components that may require maintenanc e actions within a period.  
6.4.4 Digital sensors 
The digital sensors are the outputs of the physics- based and data mining models explained in 
chapter 3 and 4 respectively. Table 53 shows the di gital sensors for all the assemblies. Only 
the outputs of the gearbox, power converter and pit ch system digital sensor are considered 
within the O&M cost model.

6.4.5 Maintenance strategies 
In order to analyse the cost of repair, availabilit y and loss of production, using the digital 
sensors developed in previous chapters, a case stud y is established and presented in the 
following.  
Wind farm and operational data 
The wind farm case study of 86MW is based on a grou p of turbines of a real offshore wind 
that is anonymised. The turbines are selected takin g into account the original position of the 
turbines within the wind farm design as well as 1 y ear SCADA data. The fictitious wind farm 
used for this study is described in Table 54. The c alculations of the main outputs: availability, 
downtime, costs and other KPIs, are performed for o ne turbine only.

The operational data in the O&M cost model is used to indicate the percentage of corrective 
maintenance activities that a real offshore wind tu rbine can experience. This information is 
used to set up the number of unexpected failures an d the corresponding component in the 
case study (Table 55). The unscheduled and schedule d hours per year allocated per turbine 
are derived from 1 year SCADA data.

179 O&M information 
More information about the O&M resources of the win d farm is required to establish a strategy since 
technical capabilities of the items such as vessels ’ maximum wave height, and fuel consumption are 
essential for the O&M process [138] [128].

O&M strategies 
Case study: Current O&M situation – at the beginning of a wind farm project the O&M 
strategy is usually set-up based on assumptions and  estimations using generic data. This 
strategy comprises a time-based and unplanned corre ctive maintenance. Typically, turbines 
are being visited twice a year, and the duration of  each visit is between 3 to 5 days (4 days 
average). The case study comprises 24 Siemens 3.6MW  turbines with a total capacity of 86.4 
MW located 30km offshore.  
When a component is not maintained in time or prope rly, component degradation increases 
and eventually, the component will experience a fai lure. Therefore, unplanned corrective 
maintenance is carried out. Based on 1 year of oper ation data, each of the 24 turbines has a 
certain percentage of unscheduled and scheduled mai ntenance hours, which is used to set 
up the baseline case study. When the component is m aintained in time, the maintenance 
activity is performed during the period of low wind  speeds and vessels are ready to depart 
immediately. In this situation, the logistic waitin g time of the turbine is zero.  
Technicians have on average a working day shift of 10 hours, constant throughout the year 
during the daylight. The total number of staff repo rted (onshore and offshore) ranges 
between 0.37 to 0.75 persons per turbine and 60% of  them are technicians [139] [129] . 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
180 Therefore, a wind farm of 24 turbines should have a n average of 12 staff in total and 7 turbine 
technicians.  
The power curve of the turbine and 1-year historica l wind speed data from the SCADA system 
are used to estimate the total electricity producti on in kWh at given wind speeds per month.   
Based on Figure 87, there are two categories of mai ntenance: 
• Scheduled maintenance 
o Annual time-based maintenance: Class G in maintenan ce classification (Table 
49) 
o Condition Based Maintenance (CBM): Power converter (Class B) 
o Risk-Based Maintenance: Pitch system and gearbox (C lass F) 
• Unscheduled maintenance 
o Unplanned activity: based on Table 55, the average percentage of unscheduled 
maintenance hours per year is around 30%.  
Table 57. Planned maintenance based on component co ndition and risk.  
Assembly  Maintenance 
Class  
Power converter (RBM)  B 
Gearbox (CBM)  F 
Pitch system (RBM)  F 
Annu al service  G 
 
Table 58 shows that the assemblies gearbox and pitc h system have a planned maintenance 
activity, which comprises a visit to the turbine wi th minor parts carried by technicians in the 
CTV and lifted by the turbine crane. Maintenance cl ass F take place in April (after winter) and 
August (necessary inspection during summer time to be prepared before). Based on O&M 
operational data and previous failure reports, the power converter is likely to experience 
more than one failure per year. Therefore Table 58 shows a maintenance class B in April for 
the power converter. Finally, the annual service fo r WT1 is selected in the summertime where 
the waiting time due to weather conditions is expec ted to be zero.

Table 59 shows the unscheduled maintenance activiti es assumed for the WT1 due to failure 
or abnormal behaviour in the power converter and pi tch system assemblies. It is assumed to 
expect a power converter failure in June and a pitc h system failure during winter in December.

Optimised case study:  integration of predictive maintenance with “digita l sensors” into the

class B and C in Table 59 are reduced or eliminated . Table 60 shows that the unscheduled 
maintenance class B for the pitch system is carried  out in April instead of June as scheduled 
maintenance and, the unscheduled maintenance class C of the pitch system is now carried 
out in August as scheduled maintenance class B.

6.4.6 Meteorological conditions  
The calculation of the mean waiting time for an acc ess window, shown in Figure 91, is based 
on the study in [140] [130]. The number of days per  month in the figure describes the delay 
time due to the availability of technicians and spa re part. The calculation process is described 
below and the values of the mean waiting time are a dopted for the offshore wind farm in the 
O&M cost model. 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
182 Accessibility – weather windows 
Weather data is a key input for the O&M cost model.  A concise model of the weather 
conditions will ensure that the O&M strategy is mod elled more realistically with more 
accurate cost estimations.  
A Monte Carlo based approach, Markov Chain model (M CMC) has been proposed to 
determine accessibility and to estimate the power c apture and therefore the loss of revenue. 
MCMC is a probabilistic approach using a dataset wi th sea states able to produce a time series 
of the meteorological variables [140] [130] . 
Time series variables: 
• Significant wave height 
Wind speed 10m above sea level is also necessary to  stablish a 24 hours period where 
significant wave height and wind speed remain under  safety threshold. This parameter will 
vary based on wind farm location and vessels charac teristics.  
MCMC has been created using a SCADA dataset with a 1-year period at 10-minute intervals. 
In order to identify sea states, it is necessary to  define bins of the parameters. The range of 
the data bins gives the resolution of the values si nce a greater or smaller number of data 
points will fall into each bin: 
• Significant wave height: 0.25m to 9.75m with steps of 0.5m 
• Wind speed: 0m/s to 25m/s with steps of 1m/s 
The dataset is also organised in months to identify  seasonal changes in the sea states. A 
fundamental property of MCMC is to determine a “sea  state” at any given point based on the 
previous “sea state” at a previous interval. Theref ore, the monthly data comprises 5 days of 
the previous and next month, and for each 24-hour i nterval, the next interval sea state is 
recorded.

6.4.8 Economic parameters 
The electricity sales price is highly affected by s ubsidies available. One of the main policy 
mechanisms to incentive investment in offshore wind  is the UK Contract for Difference (CfD). 
The offshore wind industry was classified as a less -established technology due to the 
allocation of CfD. A CfD is a private law bilateral  contract between generators and the 
government owned Low Carbon Contract Company (LCCC) . Based on [142], “the contract 
offers generators a fixed price over (typically) a 15-year period by paying them the difference 
between the CfD’s strike price and a market referen ce price.” It is possible to see in two 
rounds of actions a decrement of the prices. Howeve r, it is not clear that the low prices reflect 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
188 a decline in the technology cost or an increase in the supply chain efficiency. In this case, 
developers expect that by the delivery year, O&M ef ficiencies are reached [142].  The author 
in [143] states that due to the O&M and constructio n challenges the offshore industry heavily 
subsidised. However, huge efforts need to be done t o reduce the cost of energy since there 
is no clarity of how long the public support will b e available. The study in [144] explores the 
impact of government subsidies on the economic feas ibility of the offshore wind farms.  The 
levelised cost of energy (LCoE) is critical for dev elopers to calculate a strike price for CfD.  
The values of the electricity sales price have sign ificant differences between European 
countries, see figure 95. In the UK, the offshore w ind tenders and auctions between 2010 and 
2018 have winning prices between £76/MWh and £223/M Wh. For this study, the offshore 
wind farm, Neart na Gaoithe, announced in 2015 and to be commissioned in 2019, is selected 
as a reference. This project has a winning price of  £188/MWh approximately [145].

Main Assumptions  
 
In order to develop the O&M cost model the followin g assumptions were taken: 
• No offshore operation can be carried out with wind speeds over 12m/s 
• No offshore operation can be carried out with a wav e height over 1.5m 
• The wind farm operator owns the vessels.  
• Electricity sales price is predicted based on previ ous values . It can introduce more 
uncertainties to the model which, can be combined w ith weather and turbine 
reliability uncertainties.  
• Time for a technician to be available is average 6 hours. 
• Operational data – unscheduled and scheduled mainte nance hours are derived from 
SCADA data.  
• Weather windows – based on the study [140] [130]  using Monte Carlo technique.  
• The installation date for all the components in the  wind turbine database is 
01/01/2015. 
 
Case study  
The case study with the current scheduled and unsch eduled maintenance strategy is 
established in Table 58 and Table 59 respectively. The outputs are calculated for WT1 for a 
period of 1 year. Table 66 shows the downtime, loss  of production, availability and revenue 
losses for the wind turbine WT1 during a period of 1 year. The downtime is the sum of logistic 
time (time for the technicians and spare part to be  available), waiting time (weather windows 
as an average number of access days per month), tra nsit and return time (travel time in the 
vessel) and, repair time. The loss of production is  calculated using the average energy 
production per day in each month and the downtime. The availability is calculated based on 
the theoretical producible energy in kWh and the lo ss of production due to the failures. The 
revenue losses per month are calculated using the e lectricity sales price prediction and the 
loss of production per mont

Table 67 presents the costs related to the maintena nce classes of the case study. The cost of 
the spare part is calculated using the average valu e of the components described in each 
maintenance class and based on [134] [124] [137] [1 27] [147] [133] and operational data. The 
labour cost is calculated with the number of hours that a technician needs to spend waiting 
for access to the turbine, travel time and repair t ime. The salary is considered fixed during the 
whole year at £70 per hour. The vessel cost calcula tion only considers fuel consumption and 
not rental cost since it is assumed the wind farm o perator owns the vessels. The fuel price is 
estimated fixed for the whole period at £0.83 per l itre. The total cost of repair due to 
scheduled maintenance activities is £177,075per yea r for the turbine WT1. Finally, the hidden 
CO 2 emissions are calculated using the vessels’ fuel c onsumption, the travel time and 2.68 
kgCO 2/lt of CO 2 emissions [138] [128].

The same calculations are performed for the unsched uled maintenance activities of the case 
study of the WT1. Table 68 shows two maintenance cl asses, i) class B and C for the power 
converter and ii) the pitch system, respectively. T he total cost due to unscheduled 
maintenance activities during one year of operation  of WT1 is £89,069.  
 
The total values of the O&M cost model outputs are summarised in Table 69. The total 
downtime for one year is 352 hours, which represent s a loss of production of 754MWh and 
an average wind turbine WT1 availability of 95%. Th e total cost of repair, including revenue 
losses, is £266,144. Due to O&M operations during o ne year, around 10 tonnes of CO 2 are 
emitted into the atmosphere.

194 Based on the digital sensor of the power converter (physics-based model), assuming 60% of 
damage accumulation with an expected failure date w ithin 8 months (August), the 
maintenance activity to avoid a power converter fai lure now is part of the scheduled 
maintenance. Based on Table 58, there is a schedule d maintenance related to the annual 
service (maintenance class F). In April there are 1 3 hours of daylight and the annual service 
and travel time takes only 6 hours, therefore, it i s possible to perform a maintenance class B 
during that scheduled activities. The described sce nario represents waiting time due to 
weather and no logistics delay time. It only increa ses the time spent on the turbine by 
technicians.  
It is assumned that the digital sensor of the pitch  system (data mining) predicted yellow status 
at the beginning of the period. The failure mode is  unknown, therefore, a visit to investigate 
the pitch system condition is required before winte r. A maintenance class B is included in the 
scheduled maintenance of the case study. An entirel y new offshore activity is planned to 
avoid the failure of the pitch system during winter , which is classified as maintenance class C 
in Table 60.  
Table 70 shows a reduction of 28.47% of the total d owntime with an improvement of 1.64% 
of turbine availability in one year applying. This represents a reduction of £86,071 in the 
revenue losses. With the use of digital sensors, th e total cost of repair fell from £266,144 to 
£149,102.

195 CHAPTER 7 – CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS 
7.1 General  
This chapter summarises the research and project de velopment. It covers the whole spectrum 
of O&M optimisation process, from data analysis and  decision-making process to O&M 
optimisation outputs. Further work is also describe d for each part of the project.  
The project was focused on the development of tools  to optimise O&M of offshore wind 
farms. A literature review and market research were  performed to identify failure 
mechanisms and commercially available solutions tha t have been critical for the turbine 
operation. Physics-based models to estimate damage accumulation of the gearbox and power 
converter are presented. A data mining approach is proposed for the pitch system integrating 
subject matter expert knowledge. Finally, an O&M co st model is proposed to compare costs 
and turbine availability  with and without the use of intelligent approaches for failure 
diagnosis and prognosis in the maintenance strategi es.  
The main contributions of the thesis are listed bel ow: 
a)  Through the application of the FMEA tool, it was id entified that the gearbox, power 
converter, yaw system and pitch system are the most  critical assemblies for the 
offshore wind turbine. 
b)  A data control index CAAR was proposed in the FMEA to register the data and 
information used to assign the severity, occurrence  and detection rating. The CAAR 
index aims to secure a consistent evaluation proces s and allows future iterations to 
improve the RPN based on the data source. 
c)  A physics-based model of the gearbox is proposed to  determine the damage 
accumulation in the bearings of the high-speed shaf t.  
d)  A physics-based model of the power converter is pro posed to determine the thermal 
cycling and accumulated damage in the power electro nic components - IGBTs and 
diodes. 
e)  A data mining approach using SVM and KNN techniques  is proposed as an alarm 
system. The methodology integrates turbine knowledg e to identify deviations from 
normal behaviour. The main output is an alarm for t he pitch system status (green, 
yellow and red indicators)  based on the risk to th e turbine operation.  
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
196 f)  An O&M cost model is developed to assess maintenanc e strategies by analysing the 
turbine availability, loss of production, revenue l osses, turbine downtime, cost of 
repair, and CO 2 emissions. Maintenance strategies are set up using  conventional 
approaches and compared with maintenance strategies  integrating the physics-based 
models and data mining approach. Significant reduct ion in time and costs are 
observed using the last approach.  
6.2 Conclusions   
At present, the offshore wind energy industry targe t is to reduce the levelised cost of energy 
(LCoE) by 40%.  Operation and Maintenance (O&M) act ivities can contribute up to 30% of the 
LCoE, so automatic and intelligent systems are need ed to minimise human intervention 
during the operating life.  Statistical approaches have been used to integrate the operational 
experience into failure prognosis. However, statist ical methods do not consider the actual 
condition of the component; hence, the predicted da te of failure, which is based on statistics, 
can even be after the actual failure occurs, leadin g to consequential damages. 
Offshore wind turbines tend to be larger than those  used onshore in order to improve the 
MW/turbine ratio, to reduce CAPEX and to improve OP EX. However, there is a price to pay 
during turbine installation and O&M which involves hiring vessels and associated personnel, 
and in the worst case scenario where component repl acement is necessary, a crane vessel is 
required for installation. 
Risk assessment of the Siemens SWT3.6 turbine has b een the foundation of this work. A 
comprehensive analysis and method are proposed to s tudy the performance of the 
components of offshore wind turbines from a reliabi lity point of view. The FMEA has been a 
useful tool to analyse critical assemblies regardin g risk to turbine operation and to identify 
their components, failure modes and causes. The def inition of the taxonomy of the wind 
turbine is crucial for the development of this FMEA  and project. Based on the European 
project ReliaWind, a comprehensive turbine breakdow n was proposed using a hierarchical 
structure. It is the basis for the FMEA, physics-ba sed models and failure investigation. It allows 
the determination of consequential damage and local  and global effects of failures.   
The FMEA outputs have been compared with standard f ailure rates and reliability information 
of previous studies. The most critical assemblies i dentified in this study are consistent with 
the outputs of publicly available reports such as t he European project ReliaWind where the 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
197 pitch system, power converter and gearbox are also identified as critical. However, it is 
important to compare the failures rates and modes o f the same type of turbines operating 
under similar operational conditions. The publicly available reports comprise a wide range of 
turbine manufactures and rated power. Additionally,  the O&M strategy has an important 
impact on the turbine reliability, even if it is th e same type turbine in the same wind farm.  
On the other hand, optimisation of O&M based on the  condition of components is explored. 
The literature review shows that a condition monito ring system aims to enhance the 
availability of expensive critical assets and reduc ing overall O&M costs. A condition based 
maintenance approach aims to reduce maintenance cos ts by reducing the number of planned 
maintenance actions. Specialised technicians will o nly perform maintenance tasks when there 
is evidence of abnormal behaviour. The process of c ondition monitoring can be divided into 
three phases; first, detecting an unusual operation  condition that is outside of the right 
theoretical behaviour of a healthy turbine. Second,  a failure diagnosis and, thirdly, the 
remaining useful life of the identified component i s forecasted based on physics of failure.  
Maintenance optimisation is a continuous process si nce a particular maintenance strategy 
may be optimal now, but it may not be in the future . Previous studies identified the three 
main factors to select an appropriate maintenance s trategy: the consequence of failure, the 
predictability of lifetime, and the feasibility of using condition monitoring systems to detect 
the failure. Maintenance optimisation comprises per iodic assessment of performance due to 
the uncertainty related to factors such as spare pa rt costs, degradation patterns, operational 
conditions and so on.  
Condition-based maintenance requires an accurate as sessment of the status of the wind 
turbine. Therefore it is necessary to improve senso ring technologies, data management 
systems and real-time data analytics algorithms. Th is robust and reliable data management 
system (sensors, data collection and processing) is  the base for making informed maintenance 
decisions. Likewise, there is no certain healthy st ate of the component due to variations in 
environmental and operational conditions and their influence on the monitoring system.  
This project responds to what the offshore wind mar ket is asking for, a more accurate and 
intelligent approach to optimise O&M activities. A maintenance policy with a proactive 
approach has been compared with a preventive and co rrective approach. Digital sensors 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
198 inform the decision-making process of wind farm ope rators and maintenance activities are 
planned to avoid greater turbine downtime and conse quential damages.  
Overall, during this research project, it has been identified that maintenance optimisation 
depends on a significant number of factors affectin g LCoE and the turbine availability: 
• CAPEX factors: turbine design and manufacturing. In stallation of new condition 
monitoring systems might affect initial investment and degrade turbine reliability. 
New design approaches of critical components may ha ve a positive impact on critical 
components reliability and maintainability.  
• Maintenance strategies and cost of repair. Differen t maintenance strategies may have 
an impact on the component lifetime maximisation. 
• Operations and logistics. Vessels strategy, number and shift of technicians, spare part 
availability and cost, are factors that influence t he LCoE. 
• Turbine reliability. Failure rates and component ma intainability.  
• Wind farm characteristics such as distance from the  port, number and power rating of 
turbines and capacity factor. 
• Accessibility and weather prediction techniques.  
Physics-based models 
Statistical approaches are used to integrate the pr evious experience into failure prognosis. 
However, statistical methods do not consider the ac tual condition of the component. 
Therefore, failure date prediction based on statist ics can be at any point in time, even after 
the actual failure date, with the respective conseq uential economic cost. Data-driven 
approaches use operational data such as Condition M onitoring Systems (CMS), inspections or 
SCADA data to study the behaviour or patterns of se veral parameters. When a clear deviation 
from normal behaviour is identified, a failure can be detected. An inspection might detect a 
well-developed failure without leaving any time to respond in a cost-effective manner. 
Accumulated damage determination in the time domain  using physics-based models is 
discussed as one of the methodologies with greater capability to predict failure far in advance, 
even from the installation date of the component.  
Gearbox 
Although seasonal variations will be similar from o ne year to the next for any particular 
turbine, there will be differences.  The procedure proposed for the gearbox model allows 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
199 observed load spectra to be used as inputs, enablin g the estimated accumulated damage to 
be updated throughout the life of the component.  F urthermore, load spectra obtained from 
simulations may also be used as inputs. These simul ated spectra represent future loading 
scenarios for the gearbox. This opens up the possib ility of using the statistics of the wind 
climate, the variability of material resistance and  manufacturing quality to be used to derive 
input spectra, which are representative of the spec ific component in operation. By matching 
these spectra with their respective probabilities o f occurrence, a distribution function may be 
derived to estimate the probability of failure. Ins pection, repair or replacement of the 
affected part might reasonably be scheduled when th e probability of failure at a pre-
determined future date is expected to exceed a thre shold value established by the wind farm 
operator. In principle, the same threshold value, s pecifying the failure probability, may be 
used for every failure mode in every component of t he wind turbine, enabling a rational 
approach to all aspects of maintenance management. 
Based on the failure investigation and the vulnerab ility map of gears and bearings it is noted 
that bearing failures caused by fatigue damage occu rs on several of the shafts in the gearbox 
but, predominately in the HSS shaft bearings. HSS s haft failures are responsible for 50% of the 
repair cost in the gearbox. The main factors that i nfluence the downtime are the availability 
of spare parts, distance to site, transport system,  weather conditions and service action at 
the wind turbine. It is proposed that predictions o f remaining useful life may be used to 
optimise the maintenance strategies.  
Key elements of the physics-based approach to estim ate damage accumulation of gears have 
been provided including a description of the diagno stic and predictive models. The load 
distribution of the three-stage gearbox is calculat ed using SCADA data and the model 
provided by KISSsoft AG allows rapid calculation, m ultiple failure modes analysis and an 
integrated approach for damage accumulation and RUL  estimation. 
The proposed physics-based model of the gearbox hel ps to optimise O&M activities by 
feeding the RUL into the decision making process of  wind farm operators taking into account 
all characteristics of the wind climate, including wind gusts and turbulence. Around 3% of 
lifetime consumption is estimated in both HSS beari ngs, B1 and B2.  
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
200 Power converter 
A physics-based method to estimate damage accumulat ion of IGBTs and Diodes and to predict 
the RUL of power converters have been proposed. The  simulations do not require a large 
computational effort, therefore it is suitable for day-to-day use. The algorithm comprises one 
glue code and four main pre-processors; generator, power losses, thermal model and the 
rainbow counting method. The main inputs of the met hodology to estimate accumulated 
damage are the torque and rotational speed in the h igh-speed shaft. For prediction purposes, 
the proposed methodology is to calculate the torque  and rotational speed using the aero-
servo-elastic-hydro simulation tool FAST. FAST uses  as inputs the load cases derived from IEC 
standards representing all the operational conditio ns an offshore wind turbine may 
experience at a particular site. A period of two an d half days is simulated which is not long 
enough to extrapolate the damage for the whole year  as it does not include all the operational 
conditions.  
The power losses and junction temperatures depend o n the ambient temperature. The power 
losses and thermal algorithms require information p rovided by the manufacturer. A method 
to extract information from look-up tables and grap hs is proposed to make the models that 
are temperature dependent in every simulation step.   
Similar to the gearbox, the RUL method of the power  converter could be used to inform 
maintenance decisions to optimise resource allocati on considering weather conditions 
throughout the year. Unexpected failures, which rep resent huge production losses, as well as 
time spent finding failures could be avoided by sch eduling maintenance or inspection 
activities based on the RUL estimation. 
Data mining approach 
Reliability, maintainability and availability conti nuously improve through wind turbine design. 
However, there is a balance between design cost and  improvements. Sometimes, the cost of 
research and development of the turbine can be more  expensive than the income generated 
by the turbine output improvement. Therefore, it ma kes sense to look at the O&M 
optimisation from a wind farm point of view rather than from an individual turbine. However, 
this approach may require a large amount of data co llected from the wind farm. Normal 
behaviour and common patterns may be identified usi ng cognitive computing elements such 
as data mining and machine learning.  
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
201 The pitch system has been identified as one of the most critical assemblies in terms of turbine 
operation. However, the development of a physics-ba sed approach to identify failures is 
limited by the variables available in the SCADA dat abases related to the health of the pitch 
system. Therefore, machine learning and data mining  methodologies are approaches to 
understand the pitch system normal behaviour and id entify SCADA data observations that 
might represent early stage pitch system failure.   
The main result is the identification of outliers t hat might represent an incipient failure in the 
pitch system. The normal behaviour and boundary are  defined using offshore wind turbine 
parameters such as blade position, wind speed, wind  turbulence, power output, and the pitch 
system hydraulic oil pressure. The alarm is a green , yellow or red flag for every new 
observation status, which indicates if there is abn ormal behaviour of the pitch system, or not.  
Pitch system failure modes and causes were explored . External leakage due to wear in the 
seals between the actuator rod and the cylinder, hy draulic supply line failure, valve 
connection failure, and internal leakage due to the  wear of the piston seal are the most 
common failures. The development of algorithms repr esenting the physics of failure using the 
SCADA data available is challenging. The SVM techni que is applied to determine the normal 
behaviour of a known healthy turbine. This algorith m delivered a learn boundary which was 
analysed to establish the normal behaviour. However , the uncertainty accompanying the 
outputs is not calculated.  The learnt frontier sho ws areas in the relationship between wind 
speed and blade position that are understandable on ly knowing the control philosophy of the 
turbine.  
Subject matter expert knowledge of the offshore win d turbine is required to analyse the 
learnt frontier and assign conditions status to the  variables pair. A decision tree algorithm is 
proposed to analyse the data based on the learnt fr ontier. The data is analysed in sections of 
the wind speed and blade position and interrogated using more variables; oil pressure and 
power output. These sections (e.g. 0-5m/s of wind s peed and 0-10 degrees of blade position) 
may be reduced to improve the resolution of the ana lysis. The training data is 1 year of SCADA 
data. Each dataset point (wind speed, blade positio n) is interrogated by the decision tree and 
assigned a status value green if it is normal, yell ow if it is abnormal and red if it is a failure.  
The accuracy of this approach may be calculated by validating the model using historical 
SCADA data and maintenance logs with pitch system f ailures.  
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
202 The final step of the proposed methodology is to in terrogate new observations in real time 
using the KNN techniques. The KNN algorithm will us e the training data with the status vector 
to assign a status to the new observation (wind spe ed and blade position). The main 
advantages of this approach are that it needs only two variables to detect abnormal 
behaviour. Therefore it requires less computational  effort and it is straightforward to 
implement. The accuracy of the KNN also needs to be  validated using historical SCADA data. 
O&M cost model 
As described before, it is difficult to predict the  failure before they occur to maximise the 
component usage and reduce the cost of maintenance.  Specific damage accumulation 
information is required to achieve optimal maintena nce strategy. Today, this information can 
be gathered using regular inspections and condition  monitoring systems. However, the cost 
of gathering this information for all the turbines in a wind farm is high. Therefore, in this 
scenario, there is a trade-off between the cost of the monitoring system implementation, 
inspections, preventive maintenance and the reducti on of the cost of unplanned corrective 
maintenance. T he O&M cost model aims to understand the impact of digital sensors instead of the 
condition monitoring system, on the O&M optimisatio n process. Digital sensors such as the proposed 
physics-based and data mining models represent a co st-effective input for the decision-making 
process.  
The thesis presented factors of the O&M strategy th at can be optimised:  
• Failure prognosis horizon by the use of digital sen sors.  
• Number of vessels available. There are two options,  vessels can be part of the wind 
farm operation strategy, or they can be rented to a  subcontractor. Both have 
economic advantages and disadvantages.  
• Number of technicians available. For the case study , technicians have on average a 
single shift of 10 hours throughout the year during  the daylight. A total number of staff 
(onshore and offshore) of 0.37 to 0.75 persons per turbine is estimated. 60% of the 
total number of staff are technicians. Therefore, a  wind farm of 24 turbines should 
have an average of 12 staff in total and 7 turbine technicians. More technicians will 
have a positive impact on the delay time due to the ir increased availability.  
• Preventive maintenance intervals or margins. Wind s peed limit can be reduced from 
12 m/s to a lower wind speed and the timescale to p erform preventive maintenance 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
203 can be extended from 6 months to 12 months so the l oss of production can also be 
reduced.  
• Reduction of unscheduled maintenance activities usi ng a more accurate failure 
prediction and including new repair actions in the planned maintenance.  
• To use more reliable components. The work presented  in the FMEA section shows that 
not only were critical assemblies identified, but a lso critical failure modes per 
component, undetectable failures and commercially a vailable prevention methods. 
This information is useful to iterate in new design  and maintenance solutions.  
• To change the type of vessel to improve accessibili ty. This will change the safety 
threshold for the weather window estimation. The us e of new vessels for wind farms 
further offshore, new maintenance strategies includ ing an offshore base may be 
established.  
The work presented also identified potential benefi ts for wind farm operators or owners: 
• O&M strategy after the warranty period. The complet e understanding of the factor 
affecting turbines reliability and availability. Ad ditionally, this project delivers a holistic 
view to optimise O&M by improving availability and reducing maintenance cost.  
• To determine O&M budget for future periods. O&M cos t model is a tool that can be 
used to estimate the necessary resources required i n the future. The accuracy of the 
prediction of weather windows, economic parameters,  and failure events will be 
determined by a combined probability of the models.   
• To improve O&M strategy based on operational experi ence. Operational experience 
of the turbines, wind farm and onshore activities a re crucial to improve predictions 
and approaches to the decision-making process. SCAD A data, maintenance logs, spare 
part management strategy are some of the main input s with potential automation in 
further work.  
• Profitability assessment of the wind farm. Potentia l investors will take decisions based 
on the future profitability of the wind farm. Varia bles such as loss of production, cost 
of repair and availability are outputs of the O&M c ost model.  
• Spare part stock optimisation. It is seen in this p roject that spare part management 
takes a considerable percentage of the O&M total co st. There is room for 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
204 improvements, and the O&M cost model can identify t he delay time due to poor spare 
part availability. 
• Buying v/s renting vessel decision. The cost of run ning vessels is calculated using fuel 
cost, travel time and vessel capabilities. However,  the O&M cost model does not 
compare the cost of owning or renting a vessel.  
• “Hidden” CO 2 emissions. Today, the trend is to deploy wind farm s with a large number 
of turbines. Maintenance actions will require a con siderable amount of fuel for 
technicians transfer to the turbines. The CO 2 emissions become relevant to comply 
with regulations and standards.  
6.3 Further work 
FMEA 
The FMEA tool developed in this project can be easi ly developed further by incorporating new 
approaches and techniques. The consequential damage  examination of failure modes looks 
at the correlation of one failure mode in a specifi c component causing a new failure mode in 
another component. This analysis may be performed u sing the functional block diagram.  
Additionally, failure modes correlations between tw o or more failures can be identified using 
the consequential damage analysis. Two failure mode s can lead to catastrophic failure. 
Therefore, it is important to identify them in orde r to take the necessary actions to prevent 
them occurring at the same time. 
This thesis investigated a particular offshore wind  turbine technology. A FMEA for different 
turbine configurations, e.g. turbines using direct drive generator and jacket support structure, 
would expand the turbine knowledge of this project.   
The risk priority number comprises severity, occurr ence and detection rating with the same 
level of importance. An interesting area that can b e further developed is to apply some 
weightings to the ratings. The relative importance of the risk priority number elements may 
be considered in the evaluation to represent the tr ue risk priorities in the results. 
This study explores the risk to operation integrati ng three factors to the risk priority number. 
Usually, risk analysis is performed in two dimensio ns taking into account severity and failure 
frequency only. A 3D risk matrix is proposed to be used as an indicator of criticality allowing 
the analysis of failure detectability amongst the c omponents.  
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
205 Finally, the FMEA proved to be a good source of tur bine information. The inputs and outputs 
such as functional block diagram, failure modes per  component and local effects are 
important for knowledge creation for the turbine te chnology and operational conditions. An 
interesting area to explore would be the developmen t of a tool that is able to harness the 
created knowledge of turbines with different config urations based on the FMEAs. A Digital 
Subject Matter Expert using machine learning techni ques and a database of FMEAs may be 
able to create new FMEAs for different technologies  and answer intelligent questions about 
the turbines. 
Physics-based models 
The prediction model described in Chapter 3 needs t o be implemented. FAST simulations 
were carried out only for the load case 1.2. Monte Carlo Markov Chain model aims to be 
implemented using all the FASTv8 simulations repres enting the fatigue damage in the turbine. 
A future scenario in the time domain may be created  using historical data of weather 
conditions of the site under investigation. This fu ture scenario will better represent the 
dynamic behaviour of the turbine and the potential failure mode events. Further information 
about the installation date, the current condition of the represented critical components, and 
long-term wind climate data are necessary to more a ccurately predict potential dates and the 
associated probability of failures. 
Both, the gearbox and power converter model require  validation with actual data. Even 
though the SCADA systems are standard services in t he wind industry, the number and type 
of variables available differ from one wind turbine  technology to another. Likewise, the 
models developed in this project are only represent ing the operational behaviour of the 
Siemens SWT3.6 turbine.  
Data mining  
To explore the yellow and red status assigned with the KNN approach, it is possible to create 
look up tables to incorporate the relationship betw een variables and methodologies used in 
control system strategies. For example; the relatio nship between power output and wind 
speed and, the relationship between power coefficie nt, tip speed ratio and blade position. 
The correlation between more than 3 variables will allow the diagnosis of the failure.  
The combination of the SVM, decision tree algorithm  and KNN techniques comprises a high 
level of uncertainty. The uncertainty for each sect ion needs to be quantified in order to deliver 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
206 a complete solution. Further works will comprise un certainty quantification and model 
validation.  
O&M cost model  
As is described in chapter 5, Due to time constrain ts and the uncertainty involved in the 
parameters and calculations, some model blocks assu me values from previous publications 
to calculate the final outputs and test the propose d approach integrating the accumulated 
damage and data mining models 
The final accumulated damage of the physics-based m odels only quantified the damage for 
the period of simulation. The total accumulated dam age since the assembly or component 
was installed is not available. Therefore, the outp uts of the physics-based model do not 
represent the final consumed life of the item. The digital sensors outputs are the input of the 
predictive maintenance strategy in the O&M cost mod el. These inputs take into account an 
assumption of the total accumulated damage for the gearbox and power converter at the 
beginning of the period. Thus, a failure date predi ction is made within a year. The criteria is 
set up to perform a predictive maintenance is based  on the predicted failure date, which may 
occur during winter. Winter season comprises a high er mean waiting time to access the 
turbine, resulting in a higher downtime and loss of  production. Previously planned 
maintenance activities might be used as “opportunis tic maintenance”, which means recycling 
resources already compromised to repair or maintain  the gearbox or power converter before 
the predicted failure date. The budget for that pla nned maintenance is only increased by the 
cost of the spare part for the new maintenance acti vity, but it does not comprise downtime 
and loss of production. It is also important to men tion that the daylight, the maintenance 
actions duration and the technicians’ shift are als o considered to make sure the technicians 
can perform two maintenance activities on the same day.  
Prediction of weather windows is described in this study but was not implemented. Further 
improvement will be to run simulations of Monte Car lo Markov Chain to estimate the mean 
waiting time per month for a particular wind farm l ocation. The mean waiting time in days 
per month used in this work is based on previous re search projects for wave energy 
converters. Additionally, the safety threshold sele cted for the mentioned study may vary 
using specific O&M information regarding vessel typ e and navigation technology.  
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
207 The O&M model proposed a methodology to quantify th e combined probability of the inputs 
and integrate it with the main output of the model;  availability per turbine, loss of production, 
cost of repair and turbine downtime. Each section o f this work comprises the probability of 
occurrence, even the deterministic approaches. The physics-based models were designed to 
quantify the accumulated damage and remaining usefu l life. The main source of uncertainty 
of the physics-based models is included through the  prediction model using FASTv8. The 
prediction approach comprises two main probability inputs: first, the pre-processor to 
recreate a turbulent wind profile requires site win d probability distribution. Second, the 
MCMC approach to create a future scenario in the ti me domain requires the probability of 
occurrence of each load case and wind speed from SC ADA data. On the other hand, the data 
mining approach comprises uncertainties in the thre e phases, the SVM, the decision tree and 
the KNN. They contribute to the probability of occu rrence of each component status. Finally, 
the FMEA in the O&M model represents the basis of t he wind turbine database. This database 
contains the failure rate per failure mode, which i s derived from the occurrence rating of the 
RPN.  
As described before, the FMEA represents the basis to generate a wind turbine database with 
complete information of each component including ma intenance class, installation date, 
failure rate, manufacturer, failure modes and cause s, prevention and prediction methods, 
and so on. This database needs to be continuously u pdated with operational data, so better 
decisions are taken. SCADA data can inform the fail ure rate per component, new condition 
monitoring systems are deployed to improve local an d global effects and, installation of new 
spare parts play a key role in the accuracy of the failure prediction. Additional future work for 
the dataset is the decoupling of the cost of spare parts from maintenance class. The cost of 
spare parts should be individually identified in th e wind turbine database. Thus, the O&M cost 
model outputs would predict a more accurate cost of  repair.  
The decision-making process of the maintenance stra tegy itself is based on the failure rates, 
critical assembly identification, and available res ources. However, there is no standard 
methodology to set up activities combining planned,  corrective and proactive maintenance 
activities. Future work in this matter can comprise  a decision tree algorithm recognising the 
inputs from either digital sensors or probability e stimations automatically, and the effect that 
planned maintenance activities had on the reliabili ty of the components.  
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
208 Finally, this O&M cost model analyses the impact of  the use of digital sensors on O&M 
optimisation for one turbine. Future work needs to be done to analyse each of the turbines 
and the wind farm as a whole, so resources and inpu ts are realistically distributed.  
Automation of the O&M cost model is proposed using a python code able to read each 
function block in the model, inputs and process the  outputs. The final step is to work on the 
visualisation and interpretation of the outputs, so  the decision makers are adequately 
informed.

223 Annex  2: FASTv8 pre -processors  
FAST Pre-processor AeroDyn 
AeroDyn is a time-domain wind turbine aerodynamics module that has been coupled into the 
FAST version 8 multi-physics engineering tool to en able aero-elastic simulation of horizontal 
axis wind turbines. Aerodynamic calculations within  AeroDyn are based on the principles of 
actuator lines, where the three-dimensional (3D) fl ow around a body is approximated by local 
two-dimensional (2D) flow at cross sections, and th e distributed pressure and shear stresses 
are approximated by lift forces, drag forces, and p itching moments lumped at a node in a 2D 
cross section. 
Wind and structural calculations take place outside  of the AeroDyn module and are passed as 
inputs to AeroDyn by the driver code. AeroDyn consi sts of four sub models: (1) rotor 
wake/induction, (2) blade airfoil aerodynamics, (3)  tower influence on the wind local to the 
blade nodes, and (4) tower drag.  
The primary AeroDyn input file defines modeling opt ions, environmental conditions (except 
freestream wind), airfoils, tower nodal discretizat ion and properties, as well as output file 
specifications.  
Airfoil data properties are read from dedicated inp uts files (one for each airfoil) and include 
coefficients of lift force, drag force, and pitchin g moment versus angle of attack (AoA), as well 
as unsteady airfoil aerodynamic (UA) model paramete rs. Blade nodal discretization, 
geometry, twist, chord, and airfoil identifier are likewise read from separate input files (one 
for each blade). AeroDyn uses the SI system (kg, m,  s, N). Angles are assumed to be in radians 
unless otherwise specified. 
FAST Pre-processor ElastoDyn 
ElastoDyn is the Structural-Dynamics Module.

FAST Pre-processor HydroDyn 
HydroDyn is a time-domain hydrodynamics module of F AST. HydroDyn allows for multiple 
approaches for calculating the hydrodynamic loads o n a structure: a potential-flow theory 
solution, a strip-theory solution, or a hybrid comb ination of the two. Waves generated 
internally within HydroDyn can be regular (periodic ) or irregular (stochastic) and long-crested 
(unidirectional) or short-crested (with wave energy  spread across a range of directions). 
 
FAST Pre-processor ServoDyn

225  
FAST Pre-processor TurboSim 
TurbSim is a stochastic, full-field, turbulent-wind  simulator. It uses a statistical model (as 
opposed to a physics-based model) to numerically si mulate time series of three-component 
wind-speed vectors at points in a two-dimensional v ertical rectangular grid that is fixed in 
space. TurbSim output is used as input into AeroDyn . AeroDyn’s InflowWind module uses 
Taylor’s frozen turbulence hypothesis to obtain loc al wind speeds, interpolating the TurbSim-
generated fields in both time and space.
