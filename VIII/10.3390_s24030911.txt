Abstract: Operations and maintenance (O&M) of floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) require
regular inspection activities to predict, detect, and troubleshoot faults at high altitudes and in
harsh environments such as strong winds, waves, and tides. Their costs typically account for more
than 30% of the lifetime cost due to high labor costs and long downtime. Different inspection
methods, including manual inspection, permanent sensors, climbing robots, remotely operated
vehicles (ROVs), and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), can be employed to fulfill O&M missions.
The UAVs, as an enabling technology, can deal with time and space constraints easily and complete
tasks in a cost-effective and efficient manner, which have been widely used in different industries in
recent years. This study provides valuable insights into the existing applications of UAVs in FOWT
inspection, highlighting their potential to reduce the inspection cost and thereby reduce the cost of
energy production. The article introduces the rationale for applying UAVs to FOWT inspection and
examines the current technical status, research gaps, and future directions in this field by conducting
a comprehensive literature review over the past 10 years. This paper will also include a review of
UAVs’ applications in other infrastructure inspections, such as onshore wind turbines, bridges, power
lines, solar power plants, and offshore oil and gas fields, since FOWTs are still in the early stages of
development. Finally, the trends of UAV technology and its application in FOWTs inspection are
discussed, leading to our future research direction.

1. Introduction
1.1. Background of FOWT
Due to global warming, the energy crisis, and geopolitical factors, wind energy is
becoming one of the most vital and accessible sustainable and renewable energy sources for
the foreseeable future [ 1]. As of 2022, wind power accounted for 6% of the world’s electricity
production, almost exclusively in the form of onshore wind, according to Det Norske
Veritas [ 2], the world’s largest classification society, and the Global Wind Energy Council [ 3].
The global grid-connected wind capacity is projected to rise from 1600 TWh per year in 2020
to 19,000 TWh per year by 2050, supplying nearly 50% of all grid-connected electricity in
Europe and 40% in North America, Latin America, and Greater China. However, finding
suitable land for wind farms will increasingly pose challenges [ 4]. Offshore wind power
has shown promise in recent years as it mitigates conflicts with human activity, social
acceptance, visual impact, land use, environmental protection, and bird habitat [ 5,6]. The
share of offshore wind of total global wind in the global wind power capacity is expected

to grow from 8% in 2020 to 34% in 2050, reaching 2003 GW of installed capacity, including
300 GW of floating capacity [ 2]. Geographically, Greater China and Europe are projected
to have the largest installed capacity of offshore wind by 2050, as shown in Figure 1. The
Pacific countries and Europe have a larger proportion of offshore wind due to their high
population density and abundant marine resources. These factors indicate a greater focus
on research in these regions. In summary, wind power, particularly floating offshore wind
power, will assume an increasingly significant role in the future energy mix.
As offshore wind energy development progresses, the need for floating platforms
to support wind turbines becomes increasingly apparent, particularly in deeper waters
where fixed foundation structures are not feasible but where there are more abundant wind
resources, as shown in Figure 2 [ 7]. Numerous reviews have been undertaken to examine
the design challenges pertaining to FOWTs [ 8–18]. The semi-submersible FOWTs [ 13,19,20],
which are the primary focus of this paper, offer a robust, flexible, and cost-effective option
for the offshore wind industry. They have the potential to be installed in locations that
allow for stronger and more consistent wind power in large ocean areas with water depths
of 100 m or more, making it easier to deploy wind turbines with longer blades [ 21,22].
However, the geographical positioning and floating nature of the FOWTs within harsh and
isolated environments render them susceptible to severe climatic conditions and then break
down, thereby presenting considerable challenges in terms of O&M activities. Therefore, in
the pursuit of affordable wind energy, it is imperative for researchers to explore techniques
aimed at mitigating O&M costs of FOWTs.

capacity,  including  300 GW of ﬂoating capacity [2]. Geographically,  Greater China and 
Europe are projected  to have the largest installed  capacity of oﬀshore wind by 2050, as 
shown in Figure 1. The Paciﬁc countries  and Europe have a larger proportion  of oﬀshore 
wind due to their high population  density and abundant  marine resources.  These factors 
indicate a greater focus on research in these regions. In summary,  wind power, particu-
larly ﬂoating oﬀshore wind power, will assume an increasingly  signiﬁcant role in the fu-
ture energy mix.

region. (Original  ﬁgure. Data from Det Norske Veritas [2] and the Global Wind Energy Council [3]). 
As oﬀshore wind energy development  progresses,  the need for ﬂoating platforms  to 
support wind turbines becomes  increasingly  apparent,  particularly  in deeper waters 
where ﬁxed foundation  structures  are not feasible but where there are more abundant  
wind resources,  as shown in Figure 2 [7]. Numerous  reviews have been undertaken  to 
examine the design challenges  pertaining  to FOWTs [8–18]. The semi-submersible  FOWTs 
[13,19,20],  which are the primary focus of this paper, oﬀer a robust, ﬂexible, and cost-
eﬀective option for the oﬀshore wind industry.  They have the potential  to be installed  in 
locations  that allow for stronger and more consistent  wind power in large ocean areas 
with water depths of 100 m or more, making it easier to deploy wind turbines with longer 
blades [21,22]. However,  the geographical  positioning  and ﬂoating nature of the FOWTs 
within harsh and isolated environments  render them susceptible  to severe climatic condi-
tions and then break down, thereby presenting  considerable  challenges  in terms of O&M 
activities.  Therefore,  in the pursuit of aﬀordable wind energy, it is imperative  for research-
ers to explore techniques  aimed at mitigating  O&M costs of FOWTs.

1.2. Importance  of O&M 
O&M has been acknowledged  as a primary factor in the comprehensive  expenditure,  
typically  comprising  approximately  25–30% for onshore wind [5] and more than 30% for 
oﬀshore wind [23], as shown in Figure 3 of the costs incurred  throughout  their over 25-
year-long  lifecycle,  making it a key area of cost reduction  for wind energy if it wishes to 
compete within the same market as other energies sources [24]. It could be found from 
Figure 3 that the cost of inspection  for FOWTs is much higher than for onshore wind be-
cause the onshore wind is mature, and the distance to shore and water depth have a sig-
niﬁcant impact on the accessibility  of maintenance  personnel  and equipment  [1,24–26].  
The wind turbine O&M market size is poised to grow from USD 13.22 billion in 2022 to 
USD 33.85 billion by 2030, growing  at a compound  annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.71% 
in the forecast period of 2023–2030  [27], which means that the research in this ﬁeld will 
have broad prospects.  
Wang et al. [8], Henderson  and Witcher [9], and Ren et al. [28] identi ﬁed O&M as a 
key area for future research,  typically  involving  regular inspection,  maintenance,  and re-
pair tasks performed  to prevent breakdowns,  optimize  energy production,  and extend the 
lifespan of the turbines.  Inspection  activities  are crucial to O&M as they are the basis for 
fault detection  and prediction,  performance  evaluation,  and maintenance  strategy formu-
lation and can ensure safety compliance  and early detection  of potential  issues, all of 
which collectively  optimize  performance  and minimize  costly downtime.  Therefore,  the 
application  of more advanced  inspection  technologies  can eﬀectively increase the service 
life and work eﬃciency of FOWTs and create huge economic  value [29]. The technical  
feasibility  of developing  inspection  of FOWTs is not an issue as oﬀshore oil and gas have 
demonstrated  the long-term  survivability  of oﬀshore ﬂoating structures.  However,  it is 
uneconomic  and unsafe to transfer oﬀshore and ﬁxed onshore technology  directly to the 
FOWTs without adaptation  [30]. There are no publicly documented  commercial  applica-
tions on inspection  for FOWTs due to the limited research on FOWTs [31]. However,  some 
key technologies  in inspection  missions  in other industries,  such as infrastructure  con-
struction  [32], onshore wind power [33], the power industry  [34,35], oﬀshore oil and gas

1.2. Importance of O&M
O&M has been acknowledged as a primary factor in the comprehensive expenditure,
typically comprising approximately 25–30% for onshore wind [ 5] and more than 30%
for offshore wind [ 23], as shown in Figure 3 of the costs incurred throughout their over
25-year-long lifecycle, making it a key area of cost reduction for wind energy if it wishes
to compete within the same market as other energies sources [ 24]. It could be found from
Figure 3 that the cost of inspection for FOWTs is much higher than for onshore wind
because the onshore wind is mature, and the distance to shore and water depth have a
significant impact on the accessibility of maintenance personnel and equipment [ 1,24–26].
The wind turbine O&M market size is poised to grow from USD 13.22 billion in 2022 to
USD 33.85 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.71%
in the forecast period of 2023–2030 [ 27], which means that the research in this field will
have broad prospects.
Wang et al. [ 8], Henderson and Witcher [ 9], and Ren et al. [ 28] identified O&M as
a key area for future research, typically involving regular inspection, maintenance, and
repair tasks performed to prevent breakdowns, optimize energy production, and extend
the lifespan of the turbines. Inspection activities are crucial to O&M as they are the basis
for fault detection and prediction, performance evaluation, and maintenance strategy
formulation and can ensure safety compliance and early detection of potential issues, all
of which collectively optimize performance and minimize costly downtime. Therefore,
the application of more advanced inspection technologies can effectively increase the
service life and work efficiency of FOWTs and create huge economic value [ 29]. The
technical feasibility of developing inspection of FOWTs is not an issue as offshore oil and
gas have demonstrated the long-term survivability of offshore floating structures. However,
it is uneconomic and unsafe to transfer offshore and fixed onshore technology directly
to the FOWTs without adaptation [ 30]. There are no publicly documented commercial
applications on inspection for FOWTs due to the limited research on FOWTs [ 31]. However,
some key technologies in inspection missions in other industries, such as infrastructure
construction [ 32], onshore wind power [ 33], the power industry [ 34,35], offshore oil and
gas [ 36], etc., could also provide some inspiration and technical support for the future
research of FOWTs.

of FOWTs.

Several literature  reviews present the current status and future trends for the inspec-
tion of oﬀshore wind turbines,  including  FOWTs [37–39]. Traditional  inspection  methods  
include manual inspections,  which can be dangerous,  time-consuming,  labor-intensive,  
subjective,  and expensive,  ultimately  increasing  the levelized  cost of electricity.  To con-
duct FOWTs inspection,  typically,  two to three technicians  will travel more than two hours 
from the harbor using a workboat.  Alternatively,  a helicopter  can be employed  to mini-
mize travel time. The inspection  process at the site encompasses  scrutinizing  the platform,  
tower, hub, and each blade, a task that may require 6–10 h to several days [23,40]. There-
fore, it is imperative  to explore the possible deployment  of remote and autonomous  ro-
botic systems in such inspection  activities  to reduce the expenses  associated  with human 
visits. The integration  of robotic systems can play a pivotal role not only in replacing  mo-
notonous  tasks and reducing  the levelized  cost of energy but also in mitigating  health and 
safety (H&S) hazards by assisting  human operators  in conducting  necessary  inspections.  
For example,  the challenging  environmental  conditions  expected  at FOWT sites are likely 
to beneﬁt from unmanned  inspections  through the use of UAVs due to accessibility  issues 
[24].

of offshore wind turbines, including FOWTs [ 37–39]. Traditional inspection methods
include manual inspections, which can be dangerous, time-consuming, labor-intensive,

subjective, and expensive, ultimately increasing the levelized cost of electricity. To conduct
FOWTs inspection, typically, two to three technicians will travel more than two hours from
the harbor using a workboat. Alternatively, a helicopter can be employed to minimize
travel time. The inspection process at the site encompasses scrutinizing the platform, tower,
hub, and each blade, a task that may require 6–10 h to several days [ 23,40]. Therefore, it is
imperative to explore the possible deployment of remote and autonomous robotic systems
in such inspection activities to reduce the expenses associated with human visits. The
integration of robotic systems can play a pivotal role not only in replacing monotonous
tasks and reducing the levelized cost of energy but also in mitigating health and safety
(H&S) hazards by assisting human operators in conducting necessary inspections. For
example, the challenging environmental conditions expected at FOWT sites are likely to
benefit from unmanned inspections through the use of UAVs due to accessibility issues [ 24].
1.3. Classification of UAV
UAV is an aerial drone-carried robotic system as a payload able to acquire specific
datasets like images, 3D points clouds, or other physical parameters like vibration, tempera-
ture, or radiation, allowing human beings to reach places that were previously hard to reach
for efficiency and safety. As an enabling technology, UAV has been deeply involved in hu-
man life and production. UAV represents a safe, cheap, and fast solution for the on-demand
acquisition of detailed information. The use of UAVs has progressively increased in the last
decade and nowadays started to be considered a standard research instrument [ 41]. And
the current definition of UAV has far exceeded the traditional definition of drones in the
past. It is also identified as an unmanned aerial system (UAS).
UA Vs can be classified based on several factors, such as size, mean takeoff weight, flight
configuration, purpose, power sources, sensor type, autonomy level, etc. [ 42]. Based on flight
configurations, UA Vs can be categorized into (see Figure 4): single-rotor (helicopter) [43,44],
multi-rotor (tri-rotor, quadrotor, hexacopter) [ 45–47], fixed-wing [ 48,49], hybrid [ 50,51], flap-
ping wing (ornithopters and entomopters) [ 52–54]. Multi-rotor UAVs, as one of the most
significant members of the UA V family , complement the Internet of Things (IoT)-based tech-
niques with advantages including ease of operation, simple structure, slower speeds, ability
to maneuver, mature theory , and relatively low cost [ 55]. They can facilitate data acquisition
at temporal and spatial scales at low costs that remain unachievable for traditional remote
sensing platforms [ 56]. Therefore, multi-rotor UAVs account for the main part of the appli-
cation of UA Vs in industry and science research. So, the discussion of the development and
applications of UA Vs in this paper is particularly focused on multi-rotor UA Vs, and the UA V
mentioned later refers to the multi-rotor UAS if there are no additional instructions.

increased  in the last decade and nowadays  started to be considered  a standard  research

nition of drones in the past. It is also identi ﬁed as an unmanned  aerial system (UAS). 
UAVs can be classi ﬁed based on several factors, such as size, mean takeoﬀ weight, 
ﬂight conﬁguration,  purpose,  power sources, sensor type, autonomy  level, etc. [42]. Based 
on ﬂight conﬁgurations,  UAVs can be categorized  into (see Figure 4): single-rotor  (heli-
copter) [43,44], multi-rotor  (tri-rotor,  quadrotor,  hexacopter)  [45–47], ﬁxed-wing  [48,49], 
hybrid [50,51], ﬂapping wing (ornithopters  and entomopters)  [52–54]. Multi-rotor  UAVs, 
as one of the most signiﬁcant members  of the UAV family, complement  the Internet of 
Things (IoT)-based  techniques  with advantages  including  ease of operation,  simple struc-
ture, slower speeds, ability to maneuver,  mature theory, and relatively  low cost [55]. They 
can facilitate  data acquisition  at temporal  and spatial scales at low costs that remain 
unachievable  for traditional  remote sensing platforms  [56]. Therefore,  multi-rotor  UAVs 
account for the main part of the application  of UAVs in industry  and science research.  So, 
the discussion  of the development  and applications  of UAVs in this paper is particularly  
focused on multi-rotor  UAVs, and the UAV mentioned  later refers to the multi-rotor  UAS 
if there are no additional  instructions.

1.4. Existing Literature Reviews of Infrastructure Inspection Using UAVs
When searching for existing reviews, only those that reviewed the inspection methods
that have the potential to be transferred to FOWTs are considered. Table 1 presents a
comprehensive review of research exploring the application of robotics and IoT technology
in the inspection of wind turbines and related infrastructure over the past decade, orga-
nizing articles by their publication year. These overviews aim to survey the developments
made in the past toward the inspection of FOWTs and some other marine infrastructures
through alternatives to manual inspection. Before 2020, there was limited exploration using
UAVs for testing FOWTs, primarily due to the early stage of commercial FOWT projects.
UAVs underwent significant advancements in industrial usage during this period, finding
applications in established sectors like construction, power transmission, and oil and gas
extraction. Even though UAV technology has a strong foundation, its initial application
primarily focused on the traditional energy sector. However, the adoption and integration
of this technology into the emerging sustainable energy field, specifically FOWT, typically
encounter a slower pace of transfer and implementation. Post-2020, the emergence of com-
mercial FOWT projects spurred the demand for efficient inspection methods, leading to a
gradual shift of UAV technology toward FOWT inspection. Additionally, advancements in
computer technologies like artificial intelligence and deep learning have further facilitated
the integration of UAVs in this domain.
A few review articles mentioned the advantages and great prospects of UA Vs for FOWT
inspection. Kapoor et al. [ 59] discussed research work concerning the employment of UA Vs
as a facilitator for structural health monitoring to accommodate the diagnosis of the state of
FOWTs. They emphasize the potential technological impact of the UAVs’ engagement on
the information and integrity management of infrastructures for both societal and industrial
benefits. Khalid et al. [ 38] discussed the growing interest in UA Vs for conducting inspection
and remote sensing tasks in FOWTs, including the characteristics of UA Vs relevant to remote
inspection in the work, such as their motion capabilities, payload limitations, and commu-
nication requirements. Nevertheless, a thorough and all-encompassing review in this field
is lacking. To enhance the ability to consolidate and forecast the implementation of UAVs
in the inspection of FOWTs, it is imperative to gain a comprehensive understanding of the
distinguishing features and prevailing trajectory of UA Vs.
At the time of writing, there has been no review article specifically on the inspection
of FOWTs using UAVs. Robert et al. [ 40] presented a survey on the challenges and op-
portunities of utilizing small, uncrewed aircraft systems to inspect wind farms in their
review paper. But, the paper is focused on the case study of commercial applications of
UAVs to guide wind farm planning and accurately assess the efficiency and productivity
of wind farms by measuring the atmosphere around the turbines rather than the turbines
themselves. So, this paper serves as a meta-review by analyzing and comparing existing
works, synthesizing their methods, and offering a comprehensive overview of the field.
Different from previous review works, this paper will focus on fault detection by acquiring
physical signals from UAVs equipped with different types of sensors by introducing the
development of UAVs and the principle and application of different sensors. Exploring
the existing literature, projects, and technologies offers a valuable foundation for future
researchers and can hasten the implementation of UAV inspection in FOWT. By consolidat-
ing insights from various disciplines and industries, this study identifies potential research
gaps and points toward future directions, ultimately fostering sustainable development of
the world. However, it is important to note that because we cover a broad range of research
fields, the overview may not encompass every aspect of the subject.

UAV , drone, fault diagnosis, wind turbine, infrastructure, and robotics, among others.
The search spanned the past decade to ensure the inclusion of recent developments in
the field. Additionally, for infrastructure-related topics, except for wind turbines, the
citation timeframe was extended to cover the last 20 years. During the selection of citations,
my criteria were broad and encompassed various factors, such as the presence of field
experiments and the potential practical applicability of the studies. This multifaceted
approach aimed to ensure a thorough and comprehensive review of the relevant literature
and projects in the specified domain.
The rest of the article is structured as follows: Section 2 identifies various fault types
in FOWTs and presents a comparison of current methods and technologies. Moving
forward, Section 3 explores how UAVs have been developed and used in FOWT inspection,
summarizing relevant papers and projects from the last decade. Section 4 delves into
the challenges and discourse surrounding the potential of multi-robot systems and aerial
manipulators as avenues for future research. Lastly, Section 5 encapsulates the conclusion
and further discussion.
2. Inspection of FOWTs
FOWTs, which have been deployed on a commercial scale since the 2020s, are still in
the early stages of development. It is not clear when the existing capacity will complete
its technical life or what will happen after that [ 2]. They are just at the beginning of their
service, and the investment for O&M will be an important and ongoing expense during
their long technical life. Any improvement in O&M technology will result in continued
cost savings throughout the life of the turbines. There is currently a transition occurring
toward automation and digitalization, driven by technological advancements, in the O&M
of FOWTs [37].
2.1. Fault Types and Fault Detection Techniques of FOWTs
FOWTs need to rotate for a long time under various environmental conditions as a
complex rotating machine, and each component bears a high load and risk of faults. Especially
the rotor and drivetrain, which are subject to continuous rotation and wave exposure, leading
to frequent failure rates caused by operational wear and fatigue. Additionally , certain failures
are deemed to occur randomly, lacking explicit trends or predictability [ 71]. The principal
failures of the components of wind turbines are enumerated in Ref. [28] as follows:
1. Rotor and blade: deterioration, adjustment errors, rotor imbalance, corrosion of blades
and hub, cracks, and severe aeroelastic deflections [72–74];
2. Shaft: shaft imbalance, shaft misalignment, shaft damage, and shaft breakage [75];
3. Gearbox: wear, fatigue, pitting, gear tooth damage, tooth braking, eccentricity of
toothed wheels, displacement, oil leakage, insufficient lubrication, high oil tempera-
ture, and inadequate lubrication [76];
4. Generator: overspeed, overheating, wear, excessive vibration, rotor asymmetries,
bar breaks, electrical issues, insulation damage, slip rings, winding damage, and
abnormal noises [77];
5. Bearings: overheating, spalling, wear, bearing shell defects, and bearing damage [ 78]
6. Nacelle: fire outbreaks and yaw errors [79]
7. Tower: fatigue, vibration, foundation weakness, and crack formation [80].
Mechanical components always cause a higher amount of downtime when compared
to electrical/control ones, reaching more than 75% of the total downtime [ 81]. Studies have
found that approximately 19.4% of wind turbine failures are about blades [ 73]. Many CM
techniques applied to inspect the mechanical components in a wind turbine are listed in
Table 2 [ 28]. It can be analyzed from the table that for FOWTs, the inspection techniques with
relatively comprehensive performance include vibration analysis, acoustic emission, and
thermography. These techniques are also the most effective fault detection techniques for
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

other rotating machines, such as machine tools and engines. Vibration analysis is a powerful
tool in FOWT inspection, which enables the early detection of impending mechanical
failure [ 82]. But, because the acquisition of vibration signals depends on physical contact,
it is challenging to obtain reliable vibration signals from different components at high
altitudes in harsh environments. Most of the existing inspection methods obtain signals by
placing sensors on the site to be inspected manually or by robots. However, it is important
to note that because we cover a broad range of research fields, the overview may not
encompass every aspect of the subject (Figure 5).

2.2. Existing Inspection Methods of FOWTs
Figure 6 shows the existing mainstream FOWT inspection methods, including
manual [ 84–86], permanent sensors [ 60,87], ROV [ 88–90], climbing robot [ 91,92], UA V [ 93,94],
and so on. The grayed rectangular areas represent sufficient research and successful commer-
cial application examples in this field, while the elliptical areas with filled color represent that
this field is receiving increasing attention and the research heat is rising. The dotted areas
indicate that the research in this field is still in its infancy and there are many research gaps.
Traditional manual approaches to structural inspections always rely on visual inspec-
tion techniques through telescopic lenses, by lift or climbing (including maintenance and
repair) [ 85,86]. Conducting these inspections is often technically intricate, particularly
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

when it comes to examining critical structural elements and hard-to-reach hot spots. This
traditional approach typically results in lengthy turbine downtime, leading to a significant
reduction in energy production and extensive reliance on crew transfer vessels, which
significantly contributes to the overall operational and maintenance expenses of wind
farms [ 95]. At the same time, it also poses severe challenges to the H&S of maintenance
personnel. Therefore, in related industries, it is the general trend to reduce human labor
by using permanent sensor systems and autonomous robotic solutions; its purpose is to
reduce costs and control risks.

monly utilized for monitoring  the primary components  of wind turbines [60,99–104].  Per-

Permanent sensors are one of the common means of CM systems, which are commonly
utilized for monitoring the primary components of wind turbines [ 60,99–104]. Permanent
sensors are employed to collect both environmental conditions (e.g., wind speed, relative
humidity, ambient temperature, and turbulence) and device information (e.g., rotor and
generator speeds, lubrication state [ 105,106], currents and voltages, generated power, or
downtime due to failure [ 107]). However, CM instrumentation can include thousands of
sensors, which causes additional capital costs due to the purchase, installation, and main-
tenance estimated at EUR 20,000 for a single FOWT [ 108]. These systems need to exhibit
resilience, possess lifespans that match or exceed those of the wind turbines themselves,
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Sensors 2024 ,24, 911 10 of 46
and maintain low rates of false alarms for fault detection [ 60,99]. In certain instances,
engineers may even need to develop another monitoring system for permanent sensors
themselves, resulting in a significant rise in maintenance costs. An established technique for
permanent sensors involves the utilization of piezoelectric accelerometers, which are affixed
to either the component or its casing. These sensors can gather dynamic attributes, such as
vibration velocity, which can be analyzed for the purpose of monitoring the system [ 106].
Tchakoua et al. [109] provided a general review and classification of wind turbine CM
methods and techniques with a focus on trends and future challenges. Yang et al. [ 99]
summarized the development status and future demand of the existing CM systems and
addressed the technical and commercial challenges, in particular, reliability and value
for money. Hu et al. [ 87] proposed a seismic-based method using transfer functions that
connect accelerations in the drivetrain and tower to unique seismic signatures, rather than
traditional methods that require the deployment of a range of additional sensors. More-
over, instantaneous spectral entropy is a novel signal-processing technique employed for
the time-dependent detection of damage events in wind turbines. Marco et al. [ 110,111]
conducted retrospective damage event detection using vibration time histories obtained
from a wind turbine gearbox. This approach holds promising potential for widespread
utilization in the real-time monitoring of FOWTs in the future.
In the era of permanent sensor deployment, addressing battery-related challenges
is crucial. To power low-consumption sensors efficiently, direct energy-harvesting meth-
ods have emerged. These devices play a vital role in ensuring uninterrupted power for
sustained data collection, eliminating the need for frequent battery maintenance, and con-
tributing to environmental sustainability [ 112]. Piezoelectric ceramics are widely employed
in energy-harvesting devices, leveraging their capability to convert mechanical vibrations
into electrical energy, particularly enhancing efficiency in offshore wind energy detection
systems and ensuring sustainable power support for fixed sensors while reducing the need
for frequent energy interventions [ 113]. Robotic systems offer the possibility of automating
various aspects of O&M, resulting in the continuous acquisition of comprehensive data,
improved operational efficiency, and advancements in health and safety. Omer et al. [ 114]
explored the expenses and advantages associated with integrating robotics into the O&M
processes of a FOWT using a bottom-up cost model.
ROVs served as underwater robots, capable of performing tasks and collecting data
while being operated from the safety of the water’s surface from 100 m depth to several
thousand [ 115,116]. The community has seen great advancements and developments in
both theory and applications of ROVs due to the numerous innovations in supporting
technologies in energy [ 117], perception [ 118], navigation [ 119], communication [ 120],
control [121], and autonomy [ 122]. For the research of underwater vehicles, there has been
sufficient review and research to summarize their development, application, and challenges,
as well as to make a full explanation of their application prospects and advantages and
disadvantages [ 123,124]. Due to technical limitations such as materials and chemistry, ROV
endurance will not be able to meet the requirements of long-term independent unmanned
work for some time in the future, requiring manual and logistics vessels to continuously
carry out launch and recovery. Secondly, the involvement of both manual and logistics
vessels means that the ROV operations will be significantly impacted by adverse weather
conditions. Strong currents, high waves, or poor visibility can limit the deployment and
effectiveness of ROVs, potentially delaying or interrupting inspection activities. A suit-
able solution is to combine the ROVs with other unmanned robots such as autonomous
surface vehicles (ASVs) and UAVs. Zhao et al. [ 125] examined the hydrodynamic per-
formance of an unmanned vehicle system consisting of an ASV and a ROV . It aims to
contribute to the development of a fully autonomous ASV/ROV system for inspection and
maintenance missions.
Climbing robots have significant potential in the inspection of FOWTs in visual inspec-
tions, structural integrity assessment, non-destructive testing (NDT), and so on. Climbing
robots can navigate the complex surfaces of FOWTs to perform visual inspections. They
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Sensors 2024 ,24, 911 11 of 46
can assess the condition of critical components such as the tower, platform, cables, and
connection points. Numerous climbing robots designed for the purpose of inspection have
been introduced, with a significant proportion drawing inspiration from reptilian [ 126],
mammalian [127], and insectoid [ 98] forms. They employ a variety of locomotion modalities,
such as climbing and sliding. Liu et al. [ 92] presented the design and development of a
climbing robot for wind turbine inspection and maintenance featuring a unique winding
mechanism that allows it to grip the tower surface securely , enabling it to work at significant
heights and withstand static and dynamic conditions. Nonetheless, the utilization of these
robots necessitates intricate mechanical designs and intricate analysis of dynamics. Further-
more, their applicability is restricted to structures characterized by specific shapes and surface
materials. Moreover, the setup time required and the relatively slow climbing speed of these
robots result in inspection tasks often demanding a substantial amount of time [128].
UAVs have great potential in the detection of FOWTs, which will be discussed in detail
in Section 3. In addition to the above, there are several technologies that can be used for the
inspection of FOWTs, such as soft sensors [ 129,130], mixed reality [ 131], digital twin, data
mining [ 132], IoT [ 133], machine learning [ 134,135], satellite imaging [ 62], and multi-robot
system, which will be introduced later.
2.3. Comparison of Different Methods
This section will analyze the performance of different methods in security, economy,
efficiency, automation, and endurance time. FOWTs are engineered structures vulnerable to
high wind conditions, featuring numerous intricate mechanical and electrical components.
Consequently, it is imperative to cultivate an understanding of the potential hazards
encountered by researchers in wind turbine operations [ 33]. This increased risk not only
creates H&S problems for workers but also affects the efficiency of wind farm operations
and increases maintenance costs. In addition, in order to ensure safety, risk control measures
have to be taken, which also increases the cost expenditure.
One of the established approaches employed for the purpose of ranking or prioritizing
risks is the employment of a risk matrix, as depicted in Table 3 [ 136]. In this matrix, the
vertical column represents the probability or likelihood of the occurrence of a given risk,
while the horizontal row illustrates the level of severity associated with its potential mani-
festation. Depending on the degree of danger, the horizontal rows and vertical columns
are assigned a number from 1 to 5, with higher values representing higher probability
or severity. The risk ranking of the event is obtained by multiplying the values of the
corresponding columns or rows in the table. The risk assessment of different methods is
analyzed, and the most serious results of each method are summarized in Table 4. Methods
that minimize risks and increase safety will result in long-term cost savings.

Unlike manual inspection, the cost of permanent sensors and robotic inspection meth-
ods is mainly the initial investment cost, including the cost of equipment, infrastructure,
training, and setup. The expenses associated with purchasing robots, sensors, and vehicles
can be reused to maximize economic value. However, the manual inspection method
means that the same personnel salaries, insurance, and other costs must be spent every
time. Meanwhile, manual inspection may require many trained personnel to physically
inspect and analyze data, while climbing robots, ROVs, or UAVs may need fewer operators
or pilots to control the devices. Considering the associated labor costs and any necessary
training or certification requirements, the cost performance of manual detection is the low-
est. Considering the potential duration of non-operational periods necessary for inspection
or maintenance purposes, the repercussions of such downtime on productivity and its cor-
responding financial implications should be evaluated. Techniques that necessitate regular
maintenance or possess lengthier repair intervals might lead to heightened instances of
non-operational periods and augmented economic expenditures.
UAVs perform well in this regard because of their great flexibility and fast speed. On
the contrary, manual inspection has the worst economy due to high labor costs and safety
risks. A study [ 137] of an offshore wind farm combines both financial and physical models
using techno-economic analysis and activity-based costing, utilizing data from various
sources in the open literature. Specific UAV operational models are created, drawing from
expert knowledge in operational practices and predicting environmental conditions. Initially,
rope-access inspection serves as a foundational method, constituting 0.7% of the wind farm’s
operational expenses. Substituting UAVs for rope-access inspection demonstrates a potential
cost reduction of 70% and a substantial decrease in revenue loss, estimated at up to 90%,
due to minimized downtime. ROVs and climbing robots are economical over permanent
sensors because they can perform the same task repeatedly in different locations.
Ranking the efficiency of inspection methods for floating wind turbines would involve
considering and weighing the speed and accuracy. Each method may have advantages
and limitations based on the specific circumstances of the wind farm and the inspection
requirements. The duration of inspection methods for floating wind turbines can vary
depending on several factors, such as the size and complexity of the turbine, the specific
components being inspected, the accessibility of the site, and the extent of the inspection.
The duration of manual inspections can vary significantly depending on the size of the
turbine and the scope of the inspection. It can range from a few hours to several days
or even weeks for more comprehensive inspections. The time required includes setup,
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Sensors 2024 ,24, 911 13 of 46
safety procedures, visual inspections, and data collection. The installation of permanent
sensors and structural monitoring systems can take several days to weeks, depending on
the number of sensors and the complexity of the system. Once installed, these systems can
continuously monitor the turbine’s condition, providing real-time data over an extended
period. Climbing robot inspections typically require more time compared to other robotics
methods. The duration can range from several hours to multiple days, considering setup,
climbing, data collection, and any necessary maintenance. The duration of ROV inspections
can typically range from a few hours to several days, considering the time required for
deployment, maneuvering, data collection, and analysis. UAV inspections offer relatively
quick and efficient data collection. Typically, UAV inspections can range from a few hours
to a day, including flight planning, data collection, and post-processing.
The ultimate purpose of remote and autonomous inspection of FOWTs is to be com-
pletely able to carry out missions/tasks with minimum human interaction and supervision.
For UAVs to attain widespread utilization as aerial imaging or sensor-based instruments
accessible to domain specialists rather than exclusively trained pilots, there is a funda-
mental need to enhance their level of autonomy [ 128]. Different levels of autonomy of
robotic systems can be achieved toward that goal depending on the complexity of tasks, the
severity of the environment, and whether a fully autonomous solution exists or not for that
specific application [ 42]. These levels were defined by many researchers and organizations.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology of the U.S. defined the levels as the
mode of operation for unmanned systems (UMS) depending on the human operator’s
ability to interact with a UMS to perform the operator-assigned missions as follows [138]:
Fully autonomous: The robotic system can adapt itself to the environment without
human intervention and accomplish its assigned mission.
Semi-autonomous: The robotic system is capable of autonomous operation but requires
various levels of human–robot interaction/interface.
Teleoperation: The human operator controls the actuators remotely using sensory feedback.
Remote control: The human operator controls the actuators continuously and remotely
on a continuous basis without any initiative of the robot.
For manual inspection, the human operator directly controls the inspection process
without any autonomy or automation. Permanent sensors, being stationary and continu-
ously collecting data without human intervention, operate fully autonomously. Climbing
robots exhibit a certain level of autonomous operation, although occasional human inter-
vention or guidance may be required, rendering them semi-autonomous. Consequently,
they possess a degree of autonomy. ROVs are classified as teleoperation systems since
they are operated remotely by a human operator who controls the vehicle through sen-
sory feedback. The degree of automation in UAVs is notably intricate, with research and
applications encompassing a broad spectrum from teleoperation to full autonomy. UAVs
have the capability to function either in a fully autonomous or semi-autonomous mode,
wherein they can perform tasks independently with or without human intervention, or in a
teleoperation mode.
Endurance time refers to the duration or length of time that a particular method or
device can operate continuously without requiring recharging or refueling. The endurance
time of the manual method heavily depends on the physical stamina and endurance of
the personnel conducting the inspection, typically ranging from a few hours to a full day.
The endurance time for permanent sensors is considered high, as they can operate for
extended periods, sometimes even years, without interruption. The endurance time of
climbing robots and ROVs usually varies depending on factors like battery capacity, energy
efficiency, and the complexity of the inspection task. There are also robots that can be
connected to a base or a support structure through a cable for both power supply and
communication purposes. UAVs’ endurance time is significantly based on factors such as
battery capacity, payload weight, and weather conditions. Small consumer-grade UAVs
often have relatively short endurance times, typically ranging from 20 to 30 min.

Through the above analysis of security, economy, efficiency, automation, and en-
durance time, the UAV’s superior comprehensive performance is indicated as summarized
in Table 5. However, it is crucial to acknowledge its limitations, particularly in relation to
battery life and endurance, which present significant challenges but cannot be effectively
addressed within a predictable time frame. The ability to prolong the operational duration
of UAVs remains an elusive goal, prompting the exploration of alternative research direc-
tions to mitigate this issue. Through the synthesis of various approaches, it can be inferred
that distinct methodologies possess their own merits and demerits across different facets.
Consequently, a singular methodology is typically insufficient to satisfy all the demands of
an inspection mission comprehensively. Hence, the amalgamation of diverse inspection
methods presents a promising trajectory for future exploration. Considering this, a promis-
ing approach is to combine UAVs with other robot platforms, thereby compensating for
their endurance deficiencies by leveraging the inherent advantages offered by alternative
platforms, which will be introduced later.

3. UA V Techniques and Applications in FOWTs Inspection
Due to their high mobility and simple structure, UAVs can be rapidly deployed and
automatically perform repetitive tasks in different locations, greatly reducing the workload
of manual labor and saving time and cost. By leveraging UAV technology, operators can
enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of FOWT inspections, ensuring the continued
O&M of these vital renewable energy assets to produce cheaper energy, promote industry
and science, and protect the environment. UAV-based inspection provides a cost-effective
and efficient solution by enabling close-range inspections without the need for human
presence on the turbines. This approach enhances safety, reduces operational costs, and
minimizes turbine downtime by (1) enhanced frequency and expanded spatial coverage of
the wind farm within a condensed time frame, (2) the capability to affix diverse imaging
and acoustic sensors onto the UAV , enabling comprehensive data acquisition, and (3) the
advancement in H&S considerations by alleviating the need for human personnel to access
the FOWTs (Figure 7).

3.1. UAVs’ Development  and Applications  in Industries  
As an enabling  technology,  the development  direction  of UAVs is guided by task re-
quirements,  and it can also use the widespread  and versatility  of its own applications  to 
inspire and diversify  the task. Figure 8a conducts  a bibliometric  analysis illustrating  the 
number of publications  of UAVs in the acknowledged  databases,  IEEE and ASME, from 
1990 to 2022, which reﬂects the trend in their research and development.  It can be found 
from the ﬁgure that there are two signiﬁcant inﬂection points in the research trend of 
UAVs, respectively,  in 2005 and 2014. The reason for the ﬁrst inﬂection point is that there 
were advancements  in micro-electro-mechanical  system (MEMS) technology,  particularly  
in the small and aﬀordable inertial measurement  unit (IMU) and GPS receivers,  as shown 
in Figure 8b,c in the mid-2000s  [139–141].  There was another inﬂection point in the re-
search trend of UAVs in 2014, which revealed  an exponential  surge in the number and 
growth rate of related investigations  after that year. Because there was a growing demand 
for multi-rotor  UAVs in civilian applications,  which provided  the necessary  resources  and 
motivation  for research and development  in this area, the global expenditures  on com-
mercial UAVs in 2014 stood at USD 700 million, with DJI being the market leader, followed  
by Parrot and 3DRobotics  [142]. The development  of UAVs in 2014 marked a signiﬁcant 
breakthrough  in the ﬁeld of aviation.

3.1. UAVs’ Development and Applications in Industries
As an enabling technology, the development direction of UAVs is guided by task
requirements, and it can also use the widespread and versatility of its own applications to
inspire and diversify the task. Figure 8a conducts a bibliometric analysis illustrating the
number of publications of UAVs in the acknowledged databases, IEEE and ASME, from
1990 to 2022, which reflects the trend in their research and development. It can be found
from the figure that there are two significant inflection points in the research trend of UAVs,
respectively, in 2005 and 2014. The reason for the first inflection point is that there were
advancements in micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) technology, particularly in the
small and affordable inertial measurement unit (IMU) and GPS receivers, as shown in
Figure 8b,c in the mid-2000s [ 139–141]. There was another inflection point in the research
trend of UAVs in 2014, which revealed an exponential surge in the number and growth rate
of related investigations after that year. Because there was a growing demand for multi-
rotor UAVs in civilian applications, which provided the necessary resources and motivation
for research and development in this area, the global expenditures on commercial UAVs in
2014 stood at USD 700 million, with DJI being the market leader, followed by Parrot and
3DRobotics [ 142]. The development of UAVs in 2014 marked a significant breakthrough in
the field of aviation.
UAVs have become one of the most vital of the emerging industry. The low price and
the very friendly use of commercial UAVs make these systems considered suitable for an
incredible number of potential application fields, even where the users are not particularly
skilled in aeronautics systems [ 41]. Many researchers have conducted some compre-
hensive literature reviews [ 143,144], summarizing the application status and prospect of
UAVs with the benefits over manned systems in terms of mission safety and operational
costs. UAVs are gradually used in more and more industries that rely on human labor,
especially with a dangerous, repetitive, and wide range of activities, including military
operations [ 145,146], agriculture [ 55,147], mining [ 62,148], disaster relief [ 149,150], surveil-
lance and monitoring [151,152], infrastructure inspection [ 70], IoT [ 153,154], domestic law
enforcement [ 155], archaeological excavations [ 156], film and photography [ 157], forest fire
detection and firefighting operations [158], and so on.

IEEE and ASME can reflect their inflection points because of the birth of ( a) MEMS inertial navigation
sensor (GY-85), ( b) GPS module and integrated patch antenna.
3.2. Payload Hardware and Its Functions in Inspection
Early damage identification is crucial for minimizing maintenance costs, mitigating
operational uncertainties, and preventing catastrophic consequences [ 159]. For example,
prompt detection of minor turbine blade damage allows for efficient on-site management
before it escalates into more significant issues necessitating blade replacement [ 100]. Subse-
quently, the replacement of large turbine components entails substantial expenses associ-
ated with disassembly, transportation, and reassembly. Numerous methods have been de-
veloped to facilitate damage detection in wind turbines. Based on their working principles
and distinctive features, on-site NDE techniques encompass vibration analyses [160], ultra-
sound [ 161], X-ray [ 162], strain sensing [ 163], acoustic emission [ 164], computer vision [165],
thermography [ 166], eddy current [ 167], hyperspectral imaging [ 168], and so on. The differ-
ent kinds of payloads carried by the UAVs, that is, the various sensors, can give the UAVs
the ability to acquire different physical signals.
Currently , UA Vs primarily transport advanced high-definition cameras to inspect turbine
blades. Thanks to advancements in optics and computer tech, visual monitoring has evolved
from static detection to dynamic surveillance. RGB cameras (shown in Figure 9a) can capture
high-resolution images for visual inspection of the turbines, assisting in identifying surface
defects, corrosion, or other anomalies. Moolan-Feroze et al. [ 169] presented a method for
simultaneously localizing a UAV and fitting a wind turbine model for surface inspection.
However, the distance resolution of the visual system is limited to a mere four meters per
pixel, resulting in a comparatively lower precision when compared to a LiDAR-based system.
However, ensuring continuous focus of the camera throughout the entirety of the inspection
procedure entails maintaining a consistent relative proximity to the blade, which frequently
presents challenges in adverse atmospheric conditions at elevated heights.
However, the quality of image-only inspections is often affected by the motion blur
of UAVs for visual inspection and damage detection on civil structures. The quality of
photographs and videos captured through the utilization of UAVs is significantly impacted
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

by a myriad of factors, including but not limited to lighting circumstances, proximity to the
subject, and the motion of the vehicle arising from environmental influences [170].
Deep learning techniques like support vector machines and convolutional neural
networks have significantly enhanced the automatic extraction of intricate blade damage
features, marking a notable advancement in this field [ 74]. Multiple studies have explored
using machine learning methods to automate the analysis of wind turbine inspections,
aiming to reduce both time and expenses [ 65]. Shihavuddin et al. [ 171] pioneered an
automated damage detection system using deep learning, employing meticulously labeled
data. Their approach involved utilizing a dataset captured by an RGB camera mounted on
a UAV featuring diverse wind turbines in Denmark. This dataset was used to both train
and evaluate their algorithm. They employed a fast R-CNN deep network, leveraging both
manually annotated samples and expanded data to effectively identify defects. The system
primarily offered guidance to inspectors during data analysis.
Some visual inspection missions aim to gather high-resolution visual data pertaining
to specific areas of interest and to generate three-dimensional surface models. Subsequently,
inspection experts will utilize all accessible data to scrutinize and identify potential flaws in
their assets. Kanellakis et al. [ 172] utilized a monocular camera structure from motion [ 173]
to process captured data and create a global representation. The approach is chosen for
its scalability and ability to capture depth information. The collected data are downsam-
pled to remove redundancy, and multi-view stereo algorithms [ 174] are used for dense
reconstruction based on stereo image pairs.
Infrared thermography (IRT) (shown in Figure 9b) stands out as an NDT with the
capability to detect the most significant defects that may arise during the service life
of composite wind blades, such as cracks, voids, delamination, structural damage, and
corrosion, by observing the component’s thermal radiation patterns [ 65]. IRT provides
detailed visualization of internal as well as external blade damage when compared with
inspections completed by the naked eye. Galleguillos et al. [ 175] presented an NDT method
for the inspection with an IRT and examining blades on-site. The presented inspection
methodology could effectively detect flaws in the turbine blades, such as cracks, impacts,
and delamination. This study verified that ambient variations in temperature are sufficient
for revealing defects through IRT. By using UAVs and thermographic imaging, the time of
wind turbine inspections is reduced to 15–20 min per blade, and risk to human inspectors
is minimized.
LiDAR (shown in Figure 9c) is used to measure distances and generate precise 3D
models of wind turbine blades, helping to detect deformities or damage. LiDAR sensors
possess a noteworthy capacity to gather a substantial quantity of precise point coordinates
over considerable distances, measuring distances and generating precise 3D models of
wind turbine blades, helping to detect deformities or damage. The convergence of these
sensors with UAVs presents a formidable synergy, enabling the pursuit of more intricate
undertakings. Schäfer et al. [ 176] proposed a concept for a UAV to perform automated flight
using 2D LiDAR at a wind turbine with the potential to improve safety, efficiency, and cost-
effectiveness with a priori 3D mapping of the plant, spline-based flight path planning, and a
collision avoidance and distance control system. Car et al. [ 94] demonstrated the utilization
of a UAV equipped with LiDAR sensors in a semi-autonomous inspection scenario of wind
turbine blades. The UAV navigates from the blade base to the tip and returns, maintaining a
consistent relative distance and alignment with the blade plane. This approach also enables
the acquisition of a comprehensive 3D model of the wind turbine structure.
Ultrasonic sensors (shown in Figure 9d) are employed for thickness measurements and
structural integrity evaluation of turbine components, particularly the tower and blades.
Nearly all the current research on using UAVs in FOWT inspection is based on computer
vision and image analysis other than capturing physical signals because it is technically easy
for UAVs to take images. Traditionally, the photogrammetric inspection cannot distinguish
minute discontinuities or deformations beneath a surface coating. Ultrasonic sensors
play a crucial role in assessing crack dimensions and evaluating the structural state of
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

infrastructure. But, ultrasonic techniques necessitate direct contact between the sensor and
the surface of the bridge or tunnel, along with the application of a consistent force during
measurements [ 177]. These methods enable precise measurements of crack depth and
width, providing valuable insights into the condition of the infrastructure’s components.
Zhang et al. [ 178] presented a contact inspection method with an ultrasound probe installed
at the tip of a spring-loaded arm extending from the center of the UAV and simulated a
scenario common to industrial inspections.
Anemometers (shown in Figure 9e) measure wind speed, providing crucial data on
the wind speeds in the vicinity of wind turbines. Various types of anemometers include
cup anemometers and ultrasonic anemometers, among others. Weather sensors encompass
sensors measuring temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and wind direction. Such
data aid in comprehending environmental conditions, guiding the operation and mainte-
nance of wind turbines. These sensors aid in understanding the dynamic environmental
factors influencing the performance and operational status of wind energy generators.
Wind resource assessment requires wind measurements on-site for about two years [ 179].
More measurements produce a fuller picture of available wind resources. UAVs can pro-
vide in situ wind and atmospheric state measurements at targeted locations to augment
observational records. And continued atmospheric measurement around installed tur-
bines is required for the performance evaluation of a wind farm while providing helpful
information that can be used to improve future wind farm projects. In 2022, Li et al. [ 180]
published results from a study on the use of UAVs for detecting wind turbine wakes with a
DJI M600PRO drone. The UAV was equipped with a 0.5 kg SA210 ultrasonic anemometer
capable of sensing winds at speeds ranging from 0 to 50 m/s. This demonstrates the ability
of UAVs to take precise, coordinated measurements around installed turbines.

In the inspection of FOWTs, employing multiple sensors concurrently via UAVs
(shown in Figure 9f) is crucial due to the complex and multifaceted nature of the task.
Integrating data from various sensors provides a comprehensive understanding of both
the turbines and their surrounding environment, contributing to increased efficiency and
reliability of wind farms. By amalgamating data from multiple sensors, it minimizes the
shortcomings of individual sensors and increases the overall accuracy and reliability of
the inspection process. This fusion allows cross-validation and more precise identification
of potential issues or anomalies. What is more, the concurrent use of multiple sensors
streamlines the inspection process. Instead of conducting separate missions for different
types of inspections, a single UAV equipped with multiple sensors can gather various data
types in one flight, saving time and resources. Sa et al. [ 128] presented a shared autonomy
approach using UAVs to inspect vertical pole-like infrastructure. The proposed system
utilizes an image-based visual servoing (IBVS) technique with two line features to stabilize
the UAV and incorporates visual, inertial, and sonar data.
3.3. Control of UAV in Inspection
3.3.1. Classification of UAV Automation Levels
Depending on the degree of human participation in the task weight, the applica-
tion of UAVs in the inspection of FOWTs can be classified into fully autonomous, semi-
autonomous, teleoperation, and remote control [ 68,138]. At present, most of the commercial
applications of UAVs in FOWT inspection are based on manual remote control. The operator
visually controls the UAV near the blade or tower and then uses the onboard high-definition
camera or other equipment to collect the required information. However, manual operation
often means that UAVs and FOWTs need to be in the pilot’s line of sight, which means
that the pilot and equipment, such as the remote control and ground station, need to be
transported to the location of the wind farm. This demand means the expenditure of
personnel and logistics vessels but also means that the mission will be affected by weather,
sea conditions, working time, and other factors, affecting the efficiency of the inspection
and ultimately increasing the operating cost of the wind farm. These limitations further
hinder the potential for conducting unmanned inspections for FOWTs [66].
For manually operated UAVs, the application is more embodied in experience, rel-
evant standards, or specifications than in academic publications. The team tasked with
executing missions involving near-vertical structures typically comprises three key roles:
the flight director, the pilot, and the mission specialist, as shown in Figure 10a [ 182]. Given
their expediency in adverse and high-altitude settings, manually operated UAVs do not
exhibit novelty within this domain. The current trend is that newly constructed wind
turbines surpass a hub height of 100 m. The manual operational complexities associated
with UAV navigation in this particular scenario pose significant challenges. Existing reg-
ulations mandate that the operator of a UAV must maintain direct visual observation of
the aircraft [ 183]. Nevertheless, this task poses a considerable challenge for the operator in
ensuring a secure and consistent distance from the structure under inspection. Assessing
the appropriate standoff distance becomes arduous from the ground perspective, and once
the aircraft becomes obscured by the structure, such evaluation becomes unfeasible.
Furthermore, when conducting successive inspections of multiple wind turbines,
the repetitive nature of the task can induce fatigue and weariness of the pilot, which
increases the probability of hazards, affects the efficiency of the wind farm, and increases
operating costs [ 176]. Meanwhile, instances of communication breakdowns between pilots
and the UAVs can potentially lead to a relinquishment of operational command [ 39].
Automated operation of UAVs reduces reliance on real-time communication, allowing
them to operate autonomously and execute pre-programmed flight plans even in the
event of communication failures. They enable extended-range and beyond-line-of-sight
operations while minimizing the potential for human error. Consequently, some researchers
have turned their attention to the automated inspection of UAVs. In recent years, with
the development of computer vision, multi-sensor fusion, and other technologies, some

automatically operated UAVs for FOWTs inspection technologies and projects have been
proposed [ 85,94,169,172], but all of these projects are in the laboratory or simulation stage,
and there is still a certain gap between actual application. Conducting field operations
of UAVs in non-laboratory settings, particularly in proximity to expansive infrastructural
installations like wind turbines, presents substantial multidisciplinary research challenges.

 means that the pilot and equipment,  such as the remote control and ground station, need 
to be transported  to the location of the wind farm. This demand means the expenditure  of

ﬂight director, the pilot, and the mission specialist,  as shown in Figure 10a [182]. Given 
their expediency  in adverse and high-altitude  settings, manually  operated  UAVs do not 
exhibit novelty within this domain. The current trend is that newly constructed  wind tur-
bines surpass a hub height of 100 m. The manual operational  complexities  associated  with

At present, the research on UAVs’ automatic inspection of FOWTs mainly focuses
on navigation, 3D modeling, and defect identification [ 159] based on computer vision
and multisensory fusion by using different types of sensors. The EU-funded WEGOOI
project has developed an autonomous wind turbine inspection UAV powered by AI for
both onshore and offshore platforms, including software to expand the UAV’s navigation
trajectory or path to take in all three blades from four sides in a single flight and the landing
strategy allows landing on a moving boat, important for offshore inspections. The goal
of this project is to make offshore inspections efficient and fully automated, significantly
bringing costs down to half that of other UAV platforms [ 184]. However, the project is
still in the experimental phase. Future work will industrialize the WEGOOI platform
from prototype to product. The hardware part needs to be built to maritime environment
standards for a robust product that is operational in the wind farm all year round [ 185,186].
As one significant part of the WEGOOI project, Romain (shown in Figure 10b) aims to
develop a complete solution for robotic-based inspection and repair of wind turbine blades.
Thermography and stereography with laser heating are integrated so that advanced lock-in
techniques can be achieved for up-to-tower inspection of both surface and subsurface
defects within blades [184].
3.3.2. Control Algorithm
Developing the application of UAVs introduces several challenges related to control.
Firstly, achieving real-time pose estimation, vital for implementing feedback loops, poses
significant hurdles. In environments lacking instrumentation, individual sensors cannot
directly measure pose, necessitating a fusion of sensor data. Algorithms for data fusion
must address sensor limitations, like unreliable magnetometers, imprecise GPS devices,
and the limited frequency of visual processing from cameras. What is more, feedback
control laws must swiftly respond and maintain stability against aerodynamic disruptions,
such as sudden gusts of wind. As introduced before, these complexities are heightened in
UAVs due to their restricted payload capacity, heightened susceptibility to aerodynamic
disruptions, and the intricacies of aerodynamic effects at this scale.

Typically, a UAV is tasked with safely navigating along a designated route or visiting
specific points of interest to accomplish predefined missions. M áthéet al. [ 32] separated
the control tasks into two primary levels: low-level flight control and high-level flight
planning. Primary low-level control duties in UAVs involve three main aspects: achieving
flight, stabilizing the UAV , and following a flight route. These responsibilities are managed
through attitude and position control mechanisms based on the dynamic model of UAVs,
as shown in Figure 11. Attitude control specifically handles flight stabilization and aligning
with the intended direction, while position control focuses on tracing and adhering to
the planned trajectory. Meanwhile, the latter involves trajectory tracking, which stems
from effective position control. Typical low-level flight control algorithms like PD-PID
(proportional-derivative-proportional) have demonstrated strong performance [ 187]. How-
ever, certain situations demand more intricate high-level flight control methodologies. For
instance, for UAV operations, advanced approaches involving dynamic system modeling
become essential [ 188]. Additionally, algorithms like Cartesian impedance control [ 189]
are employed to tackle specific challenges in control systems. The important applications
of high-level flight control systems are localization, navigation, and obstacle avoidance,
which will be introduced later. Based on these tasks, there are also extended applications,
such as target tracking and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM).

Control algorithms  ensuring  robustness  against measurement  errors and unforeseen  
dynamics,  such as aerodynamic  disturbances,  are crucial. The feedback  control techniques  
examined  encompass  both simple linear methods  and advanced  nonlinear  solutions  by 
Hua et al. [192], covering  various methods  for stabilizing  and controlling  systems at lower 
levels. Linear control techniques  rely on approximating  a system’s  dynamics  around fea-
sible state trajectories.  Unlike control designs centered  on linearization,  nonlinear  meth-
ods can produce controllers  with a notably broader stability range and increased  robust-
ness. This is particularly  evident in highly nonlinear  systems,  instances  of input satura-
tions, or rapid time-varying  perturbations.  The nonlinear  approach  to the control prob-
lems has deﬁnite assets with respect to the well-established  and universally  used lineari-

3.3.3. Localization  and Navigation  
Deploying  UAVs beyond laboratory  settings, particularly  in proximity  to extensive  
infrastructural  installations  like wind turbines,  presents noteworthy  multidisciplinary  re-
search challenges.  Among these, the utmost priority lies in developing  a precise localiza-
tion and navigation  system that is simultaneously  facile to implement.  The techniques  
commonly  employed  for UAV localization  and navigation  in inspection  operations  in-
clude GPS, IMU, visual odometry,  LiDAR, radio frequency  (RF) signal localization,  
SLAM, machine learning,  and artiﬁcial intelligence  (AI). One of the primary positioning  
systems utilized for UAVs is the GNSS. However,  its reliability  can be constrained  in cer-
tain scenarios.  The quality of the GNSS signal diminishes,  and at times, it may be com-
pletely obstructed  near substantial  structures.  This limitation  compromises  its dependa-
bility in guiding UAVs during their approach  and contact with inspection  targets. 
Visual navigation  has been extensively  researched  for multi-rotor  applications,  spe-
ciﬁcally for navigating  in environments  where GPS is not available  and for avoiding  col-
lisions. Stokkeland  et al. [85] introduced  an autonomous  machine vision module for UAV 
navigation  in wind turbine inspection,  estimating  relative position and tracking blade lo-
cations using Hough transform  and Kalman ﬁlter algorithms.  Experimental  evaluation  
conﬁrms its accuracy  and real-time  performance  on a UAV’s single-board  computer.  A 
signiﬁcant limitation  of this study lies in its exclusive  focus on the initial stage of the UAVs’ 
operation,  neglecting  any endeavor  to estimate the crucial parameters  throughout  the sub-
sequent and pivotal phases of the inspection  process. The weakness  of visual navigation

Control algorithms ensuring robustness against measurement errors and unforeseen
dynamics, such as aerodynamic disturbances, are crucial. The feedback control techniques
examined encompass both simple linear methods and advanced nonlinear solutions by
Hua et al. [192], covering various methods for stabilizing and controlling systems at lower
levels. Linear control techniques rely on approximating a system’s dynamics around
feasible state trajectories. Unlike control designs centered on linearization, nonlinear
methods can produce controllers with a notably broader stability range and increased
robustness. This is particularly evident in highly nonlinear systems, instances of input
saturations, or rapid time-varying perturbations. The nonlinear approach to the control
problems has definite assets with respect to the well-established and universally used
linearization approach. Goerzen et al. [ 193] focused on high-level planning strategies.
Additionally, Dadkhah et al. [ 194] provided an overview of planning techniques, specifically
addressing uncertainties in the process.
3.3.3. Localization and Navigation
Deploying UAVs beyond laboratory settings, particularly in proximity to extensive
infrastructural installations like wind turbines, presents noteworthy multidisciplinary re-

search challenges. Among these, the utmost priority lies in developing a precise localization
and navigation system that is simultaneously facile to implement. The techniques com-
monly employed for UAV localization and navigation in inspection operations include GPS,
IMU, visual odometry, LiDAR, radio frequency (RF) signal localization, SLAM, machine
learning, and artificial intelligence (AI). One of the primary positioning systems utilized
for UAVs is the GNSS. However, its reliability can be constrained in certain scenarios. The
quality of the GNSS signal diminishes, and at times, it may be completely obstructed near
substantial structures. This limitation compromises its dependability in guiding UAVs
during their approach and contact with inspection targets.
Visual navigation has been extensively researched for multi-rotor applications, specifi-
cally for navigating in environments where GPS is not available and for avoiding collisions.
Stokkeland et al. [ 85] introduced an autonomous machine vision module for UA V navigation
in wind turbine inspection, estimating relative position and tracking blade locations using
Hough transform and Kalman filter algorithms. Experimental evaluation confirms its accuracy
and real-time performance on a UA V’s single-board computer. A significant limitation of this
study lies in its exclusive focus on the initial stage of the UAVs’ operation, neglecting any
endeavor to estimate the crucial parameters throughout the subsequent and pivotal phases
of the inspection process. The weakness of visual navigation lies in its inability to reliably
provide localization feedback in high altitudes, especially in the context of visual inertial
odometry . In such environments, the lack of distinct features due to feature-poor surfaces, like
the flat white color of wind turbine towers, makes it challenging for the software to accurately
determine its movement state, leading to convergence difficulties [172].
RF communication uses a wide band of the RF spectrum and pulses to transmit mes-
sages accurately and estimate the distance between transceivers. Unlike carrier wave-based
radios, ultra-wideband (UWB) radios mitigate multipathing issues and can reconstruct
pulses from multiple reflections, resulting in stronger received signals. Kanellakis et al. [ 172]
introduced a novel navigation framework by establishing a team of fully autonomous UAVs
with robust localization, planning, and perception capabilities for autonomous visual pre-
inspection of wind turbines using the cooperative coverage path planning algorithm. The
system achieves high autonomy, fast deployment, and accurate performance using a UWB-
inertial estimation scheme. The architecture includes a geometry-based path planner,
accurate localization, and visual data post-processing. However, this system also has
some disadvantages. Firstly, neither UWB localization nor GPS provides a robust heading
estimate, and the wind turbine causes magnetic disturbances that cause the magnetometers
to fail. The reliability and location accuracy of UWB transceivers also need to be further
verified. Secondly, the deployment efficiency of UAV clusters and UWB networks is much
lower than that of individual UAV systems with other localization methods. Thirdly, extra
trajectories are necessary to compensate for the disturbance caused by weather conditions.
What is more, a motion capture system could be utilized to comprise a sequence of
cameras positioned within the UAV flight zone. For location and navigation purposes,
ultrasonic beacon systems [ 195] are commonly employed, contingent upon a pre-existing
framework set up in the flight area. It is imperative to acknowledge that the advancement
of a mature project typically entails not only disparate individual technologies but also
the seamless amalgamation of diverse hardware, software, and algorithmic components.
Combining multiple localization and navigation solutions can lead to more robust and
accurate UAV operations. Given the constraints imposed by limited battery power, the
implementation of a robust path planning scheme, as illustrated in Figure 12, becomes
crucial in order to optimize the inspection procedure, which poses a challenge for advanced
control algorithms.

3.4. Applications of UAVs in FOWTs Inspection
Khadka et al. [ 93] discussed the development of a practice for obtaining the vibration
characteristics of wind turbine blades using a digital image correlation system installed
on a UAV . The aim is to create a non-contact monitoring technique for wind turbines that
is robust and does not interfere with their operation. The proposed health monitoring
technique can be used by engineers for remote structural health monitoring of wind
turbines during operation in both offshore and inland wind farms. Sanchez et al. [ 196]
developed a new CM system for wind turbines based on deep acoustic analysis. The system
includes an acoustic sensor embedded in a UAV , which allows for real-time monitoring of
the turbines. They present a new approach for analyzing wind turbine noise patterns using
frequency domain analysis and describe the results of laboratory tests and a real case study.
Wang et al. [ 197] proposed a data-driven framework for automatically detecting wind
turbine blade surface cracks using images from UAVs. The framework utilizes Haar-like
features and an extended cascading classifier to locate and identify cracks, demonstrating
its effectiveness through comparisons and computational studies. Icing is also a concern
for FOWTs, especially for those located in Northern Europe and the Arctic, where there
is a high risk of icing events. Gao et al. [ 198] used a DJI Mavic UAV equipped with a
high-resolution camera to photograph iced turbine blades to stud icing on them.
Papers and projects about UAV applications in FOWT inspection in the past decade
are summarized in Table 6 with their functions, technical characteristics, advantages, and
disadvantages. Some technical details are not available because of protecting trade secrets.
It can be concluded from the table, which presents a comprehensive analysis of various
UAV inspection projects, that most of the current initiatives and implementations focus
on non-contact monitoring techniques, primarily utilizing cameras, infrared cameras, or
LiDAR technology. These cutting-edge UAV inspection projects have embraced advanced
visual and sensing capabilities, allowing them to assess and inspect a wide range of objects
and environments efficiently and accurately. In addition, another trend of these studies is
that most of them focus on the inspection of blades, and there is still a lack of research on
the detection of other FOWT components.

4. Challenges and Future of Prospects Results
It can be found by comparing UAVs with other methods and technologies commonly
used for FOWT inspection that each approach has its own special and insurmountable
drawbacks. Traditionally, manned helicopters have been used for FOWT inspections,
while they are expensive and require trained pilots. Elevating platforms and ropes are
labor-intensive, time-consuming, and carry safety risks for the technicians. Permanently
fixed sensors installed on FOWTs provide continuous monitoring but lack the mobility
and flexibility of UAVs. Meanwhile, developing reliable and durable permanent sensor
solutions remains a challenge. The development of climbing robots that can handle the
unique challenges posed by FOWTs, such as curved surfaces, variable geometries, and
irregular access points, is still in its early stages. Achieving the necessary levels of dexterity,
adaptability, and autonomous operation is a significant technical hurdle. As for ROVs, they
are limited in their ability to inspect above-water structures. Finally, there are limitations
in terms of flight time, payload capacity, and operability in adverse weather conditions
for UAVs. FOWTs are often located in offshore areas with strong winds and challenging
weather patterns, making it difficult for conventional UAVs to operate safely and reliably.
Addressing these shortages requires continued research and development in the fields
of robotics, sensor technology, and offshore engineering. Overcoming the challenges
associated with manual inspections, permanent sensors, climbing robots, ROVs, and
UAVs will contribute to safer and more efficient FOWT operations, ensuring the long-
term viability and sustainability of offshore wind energy.
4.1. Challenges of Applying UAVs in FOWT Inspections
Advancements and the continual development of UAVs have been ongoing for
decades, but the systems are still considered to be in the early stages, necessitating further
validation of their reliability [ 39]. There are several challenges in the development of the
UAV . Firstly, the restricted payload capacity imposes limitations on the size and weight
of the devices that can be used. And the limited payload capacity restricts the size of
battery packs, leading to shorter flight durations. Secondly, most of the research focuses
on non-contact measurement, and there is a lack of research based on contact measure-
ment. Thirdly, current embryonic legal frameworks that regulate UAVs present significant
barriers to research and development. These challenges will drive engineers to design
new robotic systems in future studies to provide a better platform for FOWT inspection
missions. In addition to the existing UAV challenges, several new challenges, such as
technical and standardization aspects [ 208], public safety and privacy [ 209], and mobility
optimization [210] need further attention.
4.1.1. Payload Capacity and Duration Time
Payload refers to the maximum weight a UAV can carry, impacting its endurance,
communication, coverage, and operational altitude [ 211]. These can encompass a range of
payloads, such as sensors for reconnaissance, video cameras for monitoring, and mobile
phones aiding cellular communication. UAVs need to carry this equipment while maintain-
ing stability and maneuverability, which can be challenging, particularly for smaller UAVs.
Energy and communication problems also pose substantial hurdles in this scenario, further
impeding the potential for conducting unmanned inspections of FOWTs [ 66]. As a UAV’s
payload capacity increases, it accommodates various essential accessories. This expanded
capacity facilitates diverse functionalities and applications. What is more, the lightweight
nature of UAVs renders them susceptible to weather changes, particularly in adverse wind
conditions. Therefore, UAVs operating at sea need greater weight and power to overcome
the environmental impact.
Due to the limited total load capacity, there is a contradiction between carrying larger
capacity batteries and more sensors or other devices. FOWTs are often situated far from
the shore, making round trips for recharging or swapping batteries time-consuming and
inefficient. Increasing the flight duration of UAVs without compromising on payload

capacity is crucial to covering a larger area and inspecting multiple turbines in one flight
session. Offshore harsh conditions like strong winds, saltwater exposure, and unpredictable
weather can affect flight stability, reduce battery efficiency, and increase wear and tear
on equipment, affecting both payload capacity and flight duration. In order to solve the
problem of limited payload capacity and insufficient duration time, a feasible solution is to
use a multi-robot system to charge or replace different payloads for UAVs at sea so as to
improve the efficiency of a single flight of UAVs.
4.1.2. Need of Contact Measurement
The application of UAVs in FOWTs inspection is still in its infancy, and the only re-
search and commercial applications are mostly limited to the identification of blade surface
faults through video and images captured by manual or computer vision analysis, which
have great limitations compared with the traditional contact method for comprehensive
inspection of wind turbines. And many researchers focus on the research of computer
vision and artificial intelligence rather than the development and innovation of UAV itself.
This is because it is relatively easy and mature to use the camera system mounted on the
UAV platforms to collect video image signals, and the same platform can play a role in
different tasks; even ordinary commercial consumer UAVs can do it. However, UAVs, as
robots that can maintain their position and speed through aerodynamic forces, have great
potential for physical interaction with their surroundings. In recent years, several projects
have emerged to enable UAVs to interact with the physical environment by incorporating
aerial manipulators into the UAVs [ 212–222]. Some can also be used for contact inspection
of infrastructure, such as bridges [ 177,178,223,224]. Through the review of these projects,
some possibilities and inspirations for applying UAVs to FOWTs inspection could be found.
Contact measurement requires the UAV’s moving components, like the propeller, to
stay near the target being inspected. However, in a dynamic environment, this proximity
increases the risk of collisions between the UAV and the target or surrounding obstacles,
leading to potential accidents. The UAV’s unexpected failure during its mission can disrupt
inspection operations, leading to a notable decrease in wind turbines’ electricity generation.
Mahmood et al. [225] introduced a semiquantitative reliability analysis framework aimed
at assessing the criticality of mission failures in inspection UAVs, addressing system and
component levels.
4.1.3. Policy and Law
Due to the rapid advancement in technology and the expanding operational capacities
of UAV technology, its applications are constantly evolving and pose specific challenges for
flight operators, end users, and aviation authorities, particularly surrounding privacy, data
protection, and public safety within the aviation sector [ 226]. Current legal frameworks
that regulate UAVs present significant barriers to research and development. Moreover,
beyond the existence of legal frameworks, market influences, such as industry design norms
and accessible information about UAVs as public assets, are anticipated to profoundly
influence forthcoming advancements [ 56]. The wide array of stakeholders of the application
of UAV includes governmental regulatory bodies, judicial entities, research institutes,
public policy organizations, UAV manufacturers, technology developers, service providers,
news agencies, insurance companies, non-profit organizations focused on public interests,
privacy advocates, supporters, and critics of UAV use, both public and private institutions
utilizing UAVs, as well as individual users [ 227]. Since the early 2000s, countries have been
steadily implementing their own national legal structures for regulating UAVs. Despite
sharing the overarching objective of reducing risks to both airspace users and people and
property on the ground, the policies, regulations, and laws surrounding the inspection
of infrastructure vary significantly from one country to another due to differences in
governance structures, priorities, and resources. Ideally, standards should be established
uniformly across governmental and private entities, spanning multiple countries [227].
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Sensors 2024 ,24, 911 27 of 46
Several review articles exploring UAV applications delve into the regulatory frame-
works governing them [ 228–230]. These pieces outline national and international regulatory
bodies while also providing brief overviews of risk-based approaches, classifications based
on UAV safety levels, and ongoing endeavors by international organizations aimed at
standardizing UAV legislation. Stocker et al. [ 56] outlined noticeable patterns derived
from comparing regulations governing UAVs across 19 different nations. Presently, legal
frameworks play a pivotal role in governing UAV usage. With the burgeoning UAV market,
there is a probable shift toward market mechanisms gaining greater prominence. Moreover,
emphasis is placed on information and education as facilitators for public acceptance and
seamless integration of UAVs into society. However, the absence of political will remains a
fundamental barrier to substantial changes. Despite regulations existing in approximately
one-third of countries, deficiencies in enforcement and implementation capabilities create
noticeable gaps and limitations [56].
The EU regulation replaced all national rules in 2020, aiming to establish a unified UA V
market in Europe that prioritizes safety. The reformed structure introduces three operation
categories—open, specific, and certified—based on risk levels. Low-risk operations (open
category) will not necessitate prior authorization but will have strict operational limitations.
For medium-risk operations (specific category), operators must seek authorization from
the national aviation authority through a standardized risk assessment or specific scenario
approval. High-risk operations (certified category) will adhere to traditional aviation rules.
Open category operations are limited to visual line of sight (VLOS) operations below 120 m
altitude. UAVs in the open category will display a class identification label to demonstrate
compliance. Each class of drone faces additional operational restrictions, especially concerning
the distance maintained between the drone and non-involved persons (Table 7).

Significant risks of UAVs include malfunctions, mid-air collisions, and resulting harm
to individuals and property below. Regulations governing UAVs primarily center on three
key areas: controlling their airspace use, setting operational boundaries, and managing
administrative processes involving flight permissions, pilot licensing, and data collection
authorization. Shared requirements like mandatory platform registration, necessary in-
surance, and standardized pilot licensing demonstrate a growing trend in national UAV
regulation maturity. One additional hurdle faced by the implementation of UAVs is the reg-
ulation concerning operators. Commercial operation of UAVs, whether remote-controlled
or autonomous, mandates pilots to obtain a suitable license. Meeting the certification
requirements necessitates expensive and comprehensive training programs as well as
accumulating a significant number of flight hours. Nonetheless, aviation authorities contin-
uously revise regulations to align with societal needs, and an increase in pilot licensing is
anticipated alongside these advancements [39].
4.2. Solution 1: Multi-Robot System
Although UAVs have flexible movement ability, their limited endurance is their weak-
ness, and compared with fixed-wing UAVs, the airspeed of multi-rotor UAVs is not high.
Currently, the global averages of distance to shore and water depth are 18.8 km and 14.6 m,
respectively. These dimensions for the power plants installed in Europe have an average of
23.3 km and 17.4 m [ 1]. It is logistically easier to inspect onshore wind turbines and fixed
offshore wind turbines with UAVs, while FOWTs are far from the coast, and it is difficult to
meet the requirements of flying UAVs from the coast to FOWTs with a one-time charge.
The rapid advancement of diverse autonomous mobile robotics has led to an increased
significance of cross-domain heterogeneous robot systems. These systems are increasingly
crucial in comparison to human operators, particularly for performing complex tasks in
monotonous, dangerous, and inaccessible environments [ 231]. By combining UAVs with
other robot platforms and leveraging the respective advantages of each to build a multi-
robot system, researchers can capitalize on the endurance benefits and capabilities unique
to each platform. This synergistic collaboration allows for a more comprehensive and
robust system that surpasses the limitations of individual technologies. For instance, the
UAV’s expansive coverage and aerial maneuverability can be harnessed in conjunction with
the endurance advantages of ground-based or marine robots. Conversely, the integration
of UAV transport platforms with other robots yields reciprocal benefits. By utilizing UAVs
as transport mechanisms, other robots can extend their range of activities beyond their
inherent mobility limitations. This augmentation in operational scope not only enhances
their overall efficiency but also facilitates automation and the completion of tasks that were
previously unattainable.
Bernardini et al. [ 95] presented a proposal for an advanced, collaborative, unmanned,
multi-robot system intended for the autonomous inspection, maintenance, and repair of
offshore physical assets, integrating multiple robotic platforms into a cohesive, coordinated
system cooperating with human operators located onshore. The platform (see Figure 13)
includes an ASV , which is equipped with a team of robotic UA Vs containing a fleet of modular
UA Vs with reconfigurability onboard the ASV and climbing robots deployed onto stationary
wind turbine blades to carry out subsurface NDT inspections. In this project, the mothership
navigates to the offshore assets and conducts continuous inspection, maintenance, and repair
operations for extended periods, even under adverse weather conditions.
In summary, using a multi-robot system for floating offshore wind turbine inspection
offers advantages such as improved efficiency, increased coverage, redundancy, special-
ized capabilities, flexibility, adaptability, and long-term cost-effectiveness. These benefits
make multi-robot systems a promising solution for optimizing the inspection process and
ensuring the reliable and safe operation of floating offshore wind turbines.

The use of UAV systems equipped  with remote sensing payloads  has greatly reduced 
monitoring  eﬀorts. However,  most existing inspection  methods  primarily  identify surface 
damages  [184]. To detect internal structural  issues, NDT methods  rely on sensors such as 
ultrasounds,  accelerometers,  and resistivimeters,  requiring  direct contact with the struc-
ture. Vibration  analysis is pivotal in CM systems for identifying  potential  issues within 
machinery.  It stems from misalignments  and surface wear in rotating parts, generating

4.3. Solution 2: Contact Inspection Method
The use of UAV systems equipped with remote sensing payloads has greatly reduced
monitoring efforts. However, most existing inspection methods primarily identify surface
damages [ 184]. To detect internal structural issues, NDT methods rely on sensors such as
ultrasounds, accelerometers, and resistivimeters, requiring direct contact with the structure.
Vibration analysis is pivotal in CM systems for identifying potential issues within machinery.
It stems from misalignments and surface wear in rotating parts, generating noticeable
vibrations. These vibrations directly reflect machine dynamics, making vibration analysis
an invaluable, non-intrusive tool for diagnosing faults [82].
Contact measurement is difficult for UAVs, but the advantages brought by physical
contact cannot be replaced by other inspection methods, so some structures could be added
to UAVs to overcome this insufficient. However, due to aerodynamic turbulence and
concerns regarding potential collision damage, it is imperative for UAVs to maintain a
limited standoff distance from the asset [ 178]. Furthermore, to achieve a longer flight time,
the UAV load should be as light as possible. In contrast, the imperative for achieving
lightweight designs has consequently rendered UAVs more vulnerable to perturbations
during their operational missions. Therefore, it is necessary to study how to make the UAV
establish physical contact with the wind turbine while remaining lightweight and safe. The
UAV can be in two situations when it contacts the inspected object: the landing and the
in-air situation.
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Sensors 2024 ,24, 911 30 of 46
Non-contact methods are limited to the detection of visual or infrared faults and
surface-exposed defects, which imposes constraints on certain inspection tasks. When
significant damage is detected, a comprehensive examination must ensue, requiring expe-
rienced inspectors to have hands-on access to the FOWT section [ 177]. Therefore, when
dealing with structural health conditions like subsurface corrosion beneath the outer
facade, the use of contact measurement technologies becomes necessary. Contact meth-
ods [ 177,178,223] provide the advantage of direct sensory feedback, enabling inspectors to
perceive characteristics such as texture, hardness, or vibrations. However, in the context
of UAV inspections, maintaining a significant standoff distance is typically essential to
prevent collisions. This poses a considerable challenge for UAV pilots when attempting to
conduct close-range and contact examinations due to obstructed views of pilots [178].
4.3.1. Landing Contact
In the process of using UAVs to inspect FOWTs, the conventional contact method
requires the UAV to hover for extended periods, utilizing its propellers to apply pressure
onto sensors and the target surface. While this method is relatively straightforward to
implement, it significantly reduces the UAV’s flight endurance, and the instability during
hovering can introduce interference and reduce the quality of collected data. Therefore,
a more effective solution involves landing the UAV directly on the target platform for
inspection. By employing a landing-based approach, the UAVs can establish a stable
connection with the FOWTs, mitigating the adverse effects of prolonged hovering. This
not only enhances the UAV’s endurance but also allows for a more reliable and prolonged
data collection process. Landing a UAV on a moving and uneven target in a difficult and
dynamic environment is a challenging task. There have been some mature research projects
in this area, much of them are based on computer vision. There are also projects on landing
gear designed to land on dynamic or uneven surfaces, as shown in Figure 14.

 time, the UAV load should be as light as possible.  In contrast,  the imperative  for achieving  
lightweight  designs has consequently  rendered  UAVs more vulnerable  to perturbations  
during their operational  missions.  Therefore,  it is necessary  to study how to make the 
UAV establish  physical contact with the wind turbine while remaining  lightweight  and 
safe. The UAV can be in two situations  when it contacts the inspected  object: the landing 
and the in-air situation.  
Non-contact  methods  are limited to the detection  of visual or infrared faults and sur-
face-exposed  defects, which imposes constraints  on certain inspection  tasks. When signif-
icant damage is detected,  a comprehensive  examination  must ensue, requiring  experi-
enced inspectors  to have hands-on  access to the FOWT section [177]. Therefore,  when 
dealing with structural  health conditions  like subsurface  corrosion  beneath the outer fa-
cade, the use of contact measurement  technologies  becomes  necessary.  Contact methods  
[177,178,223]  provide the advantage  of direct sensory feedback,  enabling  inspectors  to per-
ceive characteristics  such as texture, hardness,  or vibrations.  However,  in the context of 
UAV inspections,  maintaining  a signiﬁcant standoﬀ distance is typically  essential  to pre-
vent collisions.  This poses a considerable  challenge  for UAV pilots when attempting to 
conduct close-range  and contact examinations  due to obstructed  views of pilots [178]. 
4.3.1. Landing Contact 
In the process of using UAVs to inspect FOWTs, the conventional  contact method 
requires the UAV to hover for extended  periods, utilizing its propellers  to apply pressure  
onto sensors and the target surface. While this method is relatively  straightforward  to im-
plement,  it signiﬁcantly reduces the UAV’s ﬂight endurance,  and the instability  during 
hovering  can introduce  interference  and reduce the quality of collected  data. Therefore,  a 
more eﬀective solution involves landing the UAV directly on the target platform  for in-
spection.  By employing  a landing-based  approach,  the UAVs can establish  a stable con-
nection with the FOWTs, mitigating  the adverse eﬀects of prolonged  hovering.  This not 
only enhances  the UAV’s endurance  but also allows for a more reliable and prolonged  
data collection  process. Landing a UAV on a moving and uneven target in a diﬃcult and 
dynamic  environment  is a challenging  task. There have been some mature research pro-
jects in this area, much of them are based on computer  vision. There are also projects on 
landing gear designed  to land on dynamic  or uneven surfaces,  as shown in Figure 14.

The existing UAV landing gear program can be divided into active and passive. The
actively adapted landing gear is composed of mechatronic systems, which change the
shape of the mechanical structure through the motor or the steering gear to maintain the
level and stability of the UAVs landing in different environments, as shown in Figure 14a,b.
These systems work as robot arms. Therefore, the study of actively adapted landing gear is
often accompanied by aerial grasping. In the process of inspecting FOWTs using UAVs,
the development of deformable or flexible landing gear is necessary to achieve landing on
moving targets. FOWTs are subject to wave and wind-induced movements. Deformable
or flexible landing gear allows the UAVs to adjust their landing approach dynamically,
compensating for the platform’s motion and ensuring a safer and more stable landing, and
reducing the risk of accidents and collisions during landing. Zhang et al. [ 235] explored
bioinspired solutions in adaptive landing gear morphologies of small aerial robots to
achieve dynamic landing on varied surface structures as well as moving targets, as shown
in Figure 14c,d.
However, there are some significant drawbacks to post-landing testing. Firstly, with
regard to safety, it is prone to accidents during the landing and takeoff process. Most
aircraft accidents occur during takeoff and landing. During takeoff and landing, UAVs
are subject to turbulence and require more complex manual or automated controls than in
the air. While specially designed landing gear can improve safety, unnecessary takeoffs
and landings themselves pose risks that cannot be ignored. Secondly, UAVs are difficult to
land on sloping, smooth surfaces, especially vertical ones, because it is difficult for UAVs to
grasp the surface and take off in a non-horizontal attitude.
Although UAVs possess advanced sensors and control algorithms, their performance
is significantly influenced by variations in wind speed and direction, which, in turn, affect
the motion of the UAVs. Any unanticipated malfunctions of the UAV system throughout
the landing and taking off have the potential to disrupt inspection operations, consequently
resulting in a substantial decrease in the electricity production facilitated by wind turbines.
Due to these shortcomings, landing a UAV on a wind turbine is a flawed solution, and
researchers need to explore contact methods that are more adaptable to complex environments.
4.3.2. Aerial Manipulator
In recent years, the emergence of robotic aerial manipulators has significantly broad-
ened the potential applications of UAVs [ 177]. Aerial manipulators [ 212,236], referring to
aerial robots equipped with arms or mechanical devices, possess the capability to engage
in physical interactions with the environment. This enables them to carry out a diverse
range of tasks, including object manipulation [ 215], operating devices [ 216,217], aerial 3D
printing [ 213,218], and conducting measurements through sensors in contact with sur-
faces [ 177,178,223]. Such capabilities also allow UAVs to not only be limited to non-contact
inspection of targets but also to engage in some physical contact-based interaction. While
there are currently no UAV aerial manipulator projects specifically for contact inspection
of wind turbines, there are already projects for other infrastructure such as bridges [ 237],
buildings, etc., which is shown in Figure 15.

The research on contact inspection  methods  speciﬁcally applied to FOWTs is very 
limited, but there are many studies for other infrastructures,  such as bridges and tunnels. 
Sanchez-Cuevas  et al. [177] presented  the design, modeling,  and control of a fully actuated  
UAV for infrastructure  contact inspection  as well as its localization  system, which could 
be used in the inspection  of FOWTs. The UAV is equipped  with a 3DoF lightweight  arm, 
which can measure  the contact force to regulate the force applied to the sensor on the 
structure.  And the Horizon 2020 framework  program  [240–242]  includes a number of pro-
jects that apply contact methods  to infrastructure  inspection  using aerial manipulators.  
All these inspection  techniques  can be applied to FOWTs after conversion.  González-de-
Santos et al. [237] introduced  a payload created for semi-autonomous  collision-mitigation  
inspections  on UAVs. The system operates independently  without relying on external po-
sitioning  aids like motion capture systems or GPS. 
The existing aerial manipulator  projects mostly involve shock absorption  or simple 
action by the robot arms and then the pressure  exerted by the UAV motors’ own power 
on the target so that the sensor is pressed against the inspected  object. Researchers  need 
to explore aerial manipulators  that can overcome  the shortcomings  of these projects: 
1. Due to asymmetry,  it is impossible  to maintain  the center of gravity of the UAV in 
the geometric  center, resulting  in wasted power, increased  control diﬃculty, and in-
creased risk. 
2. The connection  between the UAV and the detected object is rigid, but the UAV needs 
to constantly  adjust its attitude to move and maintain  stability.  And the movement  
of motors, propellers,  and other components  creates constant noise, which makes the 
contact unstable and aﬀects the work of the sensor.

The research on contact inspection methods specifically applied to FOWTs is very
limited, but there are many studies for other infrastructures, such as bridges and tunnels.
Sanchez-Cuevas et al. [ 177] presented the design, modeling, and control of a fully actuated
UAV for infrastructure contact inspection as well as its localization system, which could
be used in the inspection of FOWTs. The UAV is equipped with a 3DoF lightweight arm,
which can measure the contact force to regulate the force applied to the sensor on the
structure. And the Horizon 2020 framework program [ 240–242] includes a number of
projects that apply contact methods to infrastructure inspection using aerial manipulators.
All these inspection techniques can be applied to FOWTs after conversion. Gonz ález-
deSantos et al. [ 237] introduced a payload created for semi-autonomous collision-mitigation
inspections on UAVs. The system operates independently without relying on external
positioning aids like motion capture systems or GPS.
The existing aerial manipulator projects mostly involve shock absorption or simple
action by the robot arms and then the pressure exerted by the UAV motors’ own power on
the target so that the sensor is pressed against the inspected object. Researchers need to
explore aerial manipulators that can overcome the shortcomings of these projects:
1. Due to asymmetry, it is impossible to maintain the center of gravity of the UAV in
the geometric center, resulting in wasted power, increased control difficulty, and
increased risk.
2. The connection between the UAV and the detected object is rigid, but the UAV needs
to constantly adjust its attitude to move and maintain stability. And the movement of
motors, propellers, and other components creates constant noise, which makes the
contact unstable and affects the work of the sensor.

3. The weight of these air manipulators is very large, and the movement inertia is also
very large, which will cause a large disturbance to the UAV during the inspection and
reduce its endurance.
4.3.3. Parallel Aerial Manipulator
The combination of parallel manipulator and UAV has the potential to overcome the
above defects. By installing a delta parallel robot on the UAV to compensate for the motion
of the UAV , Professor Zhang Ketao realized accurate dynamic control of the end effect
to realize in-air 3D printing [ 218]. The excellent characteristics of parallel robots make it
possible to control the end effect accurately and quickly.
In addition to the delta robot, there are other parallel robotic arms that have the
potential to be combined with UAVs. Cable robots represent arguably the most lightweight
configuration for a manipulative system, which is particularly valuable for UAVs [ 243]. Dr.
Zhaokun Zhang has designed a cable-driven parallel robot with three sets of cables and a
central spring rod that can achieve higher speeds, more precise control, lighter weight, and
lower energy consumption than delta parallel robots [ 244–249], as shown in Figure 16. The
innovation of the design is the use of retractable spring rods to keep the cable taut rather
than relying solely on gravity, allowing for rapid robot movement. This design has great
potential to be applied to my project.

very large, which will cause a large disturbance  to the UAV during the inspection

4.3.3. Parallel Aerial Manipulator  
The combination  of parallel manipulator  and UAV has the potential  to overcome  the

sible to control the end eﬀect accurately  and quickly. 
In addition to the delta robot, there are other parallel robotic arms that have the po-
tential to be combined  with UAVs. Cable robots represent  arguably  the most lightweight  
conﬁguration  for a manipulative  system, which is particularly  valuable for UAVs [243]. 
Dr. Zhaokun  Zhang has designed  a cable-driven  parallel robot with three sets of cables 
and a central spring rod that can achieve higher speeds, more precise control, lighter 
weight, and lower energy consumption  than delta parallel robots [244–249],  as shown in

cable taut rather than relying solely on gravity, allowing  for rapid robot movement.  This 
design has great potential  to be applied to my project. 
At present, there is no research on the combination  of cable-driven  parallel robots 
and UAVs. Since the force can only be transmitted one way in the cable, and the cable must 
be in a tensioning  state, the cable-driven  parallel robot can realize the physical contact 
between the UAV and the inspected  target while eliminating  unnecessary  force transmis-
sion. The use of cables enables the robot to have a larger workspace,  lighter mass, higher 
operation  speed, and larger payload-to-weight  ratio [250].

4.3.4. Rotor-Distributed  Manipulator  
Traditional  aerial manipulators  encounter  three primary challenges.  First, their end 
eﬀector stability in the air proves inadequate  for handling  more complex tasks. Second, 
due to limitations  in payload capacity,  these manipulators  face strict constraints  on arm 
joint torque, resulting  in the generation  of a relatively  small wrench at the end eﬀector. 
Lastly, the motion of the end eﬀector gets disrupted  by the concentrated  rotors used in 
conventional  aerial manipulators,  speciﬁcally multi-rotors  with arms [251]. In addressing  
these challenges,  several innovative  approaches  have emerged.  The perching  methodol-
ogy encompasses  adhesive  [252–257],  gripper [258–260],  magnetic  [261,262],  and rotor

At present, there is no research on the combination of cable-driven parallel robots and
UAVs. Since the force can only be transmitted one way in the cable, and the cable must be
in a tensioning state, the cable-driven parallel robot can realize the physical contact between
the UAV and the inspected target while eliminating unnecessary force transmission. The
use of cables enables the robot to have a larger workspace, lighter mass, higher operation
speed, and larger payload-to-weight ratio [250].
4.3.4. Rotor-Distributed Manipulator
Traditional aerial manipulators encounter three primary challenges. First, their end
effector stability in the air proves inadequate for handling more complex tasks. Second,
due to limitations in payload capacity, these manipulators face strict constraints on arm
joint torque, resulting in the generation of a relatively small wrench at the end effector.
Lastly, the motion of the end effector gets disrupted by the concentrated rotors used in
conventional aerial manipulators, specifically multi-rotors with arms [ 251]. In addressing
these challenges, several innovative approaches have emerged. The perching methodology
encompasses adhesive [ 252–257], gripper [ 258–260], magnetic [ 261,262], and rotor suction

force [ 263] techniques, each tailored for specific surfaces but constrained by surface type
limitations. The second method, the rotor-distributed manipulator (RDM), strategically
places rotors along arm links to overcome limitations in feasible wrenches, enabling greater
maneuverability and versatility in aerial robotics [ 264–266]. Zhao et al. [ 267] introduced a
rotor-distributed aerial robot, shown in Figure 17, featuring links interconnected by two
servo motors. However, while larger-scale rotor-distributed robots exhibit increased wrench
potential, their size and complexity pose practical deployment challenges. Lastly, the root-
perching technique focuses on maximizing reachability using a minimal configuration RDM,
emphasizing perching stability considering contact conditions like static friction and zero
moment point. To increase the reachability at the end effector, the manipulator only uses a
part of its body for perching, such as the root unit. Nishio et al. [ 251] designed a minimal
RDM with root-perching abilities. Additionally , they presented a control technique aimed at
minimizing rotor thrust during perching while accounting for foot conditions and a motion
planner, and they conducted reachability assessments for RDMs to gauge their effectiveness.

By comparing  diﬀerent inspection  methods,  it can be concluded  that UAVs have bet-
ter performance  and potential  compared  to manual, permanent  sensors and other robotic 
inspection  methods.  However,  due to disadvantages  such as limited range and easy inter-

The ability of the RDM robot root to absorb on the surface can improve the stability of
the UA V so as to overcome the adverse factors of instability in the marine environment, and
compared with traditional UAV , RDM can apply greater torque, meaning that it can carry
heavier sensors for inspection, and can apply greater loads to the target, and can also perform
basic actions such as drilling and painting. Potential for maintenance of FOWTs. Due to
its deformable and reconfigurable characteristics, RDM can enter the narrow and complex
environment that traditional UA Vs cannot enter and has a better ability to perform tasks.
4.4. Prospects of UAV-Based Inspection
By comparing different inspection methods, it can be concluded that UAVs have
better performance and potential compared to manual, permanent sensors and other
robotic inspection methods. However, due to disadvantages such as limited range and
easy interference during flight, the future of UAVs for FOWT inspection will focus on
cooperation with other robotic platforms and combination with aerial manipulators. Table 8
compares the properties of cable-driven parallel manipulators, delta parallel manipulators,
and series manipulators in terms of center of gravity position, working space, material, and
weight. The cable-driven parallel manipulator has the best performance. Therefore, the
combination of cable-driven parallel manipulators with UAVs is considered a potentially
valuable research direction in the future.
What is more, UAVs always tend to focus on exterior and NDT inspections, but their
use for interior inspections is still limited. Kulsinskas et al. [ 199] discussed the viability of

using UAVs for interior wind turbine blade inspections, which are essential for extending
the lifetime and improving the efficiency of wind turbines. The challenges of performing
interior inspections include confined spaces, lack of illumination, and potentially harmful
internal structural components, as well as issues. Exterior inspections and NDTs predom-
inantly yield essential information regarding potential defects in FOWTs. However, it is
important to acknowledge that defects may also manifest exclusively within the interior,
necessitating thorough inspections conducted from within the turbine itself. Therefore, the
use of UAVs for atypical site inspection is also one of the potential research directions in
the future.

5. Conclusions
This research investigation is the first to provide a holistic overview of the status of
the inspection of FOWTs using multi-rotor UAVs. It further delivers insights into the past,
present, and future development of UAVs as well as their application in other industries.
Based on a research synthesis that includes a thorough literature review and comparative
analysis of different inspection methods for FOWTs, similarities and contrasting elements
in various methods and their advantages and disadvantages are explored. Then, the paper
summarizes the advantages and prospects of using UAVs in this field. The main findings
of this review are:
1. Using UAVs instead of conventional manual inspection methods offers significant
cost reduction for FOWT inspection, minimizes downtime, and ultimately contributes
to lowering the unit energy price, fostering sustainable societal development. Addi-
tionally, it can play a pivotal role in mitigating H&S hazards;
2. Compared with other robotic systems and permanent sensor CM systems, UAVs are
the most promising competitors for future development due to their low cost, fast
deployment, high mobility, and strong reusability;
3. The current applications of UAVs in FOWT inspection predominantly utilize computer
vision, infrared, and LiDAR technologies, focusing on non-contact measurements.
The primary research efforts have centered around visual algorithms, resulting in
significant innovations in this area. However, there is limited exploration of other
sensing techniques, such as vibration analysis and ultrasonic, as well as emphasis on
innovations in UAV mechanical design, embedded systems, and multi-sensor fusion;
4. UAV contact-based measurement methods are in their early stages, with some research
already conducted, but there remains ample room for further advancements. The
combination of UAV and parallel aerial manipulator is a promising research direction
in the future;
5. Since the inherent defects of a single robotic platform, including UAV , are difficult to
overcome, the use of multi-robot systems for UAV inspection of FOWTs is a promising
avenue that remains largely unexplored.

One noteworthy consideration for researchers is that UAV methods are designed not
to replace, compete with, or eliminate existing inspection methods but rather to compensate
for some of their inherent shortcomings. Functioning as an enabling technology, the primary
role of UAVs is to augment and facilitate the utilization of other inspection technologies
through their consistently updated advanced technology and robust motion capabilities.
Clarifying this objective will guide researchers in the right direction for scientific inquiry.
The development of alternative inspection methods not only avoids competition with UAVs
but also allows for collaboration, leveraging multi-robot systems and aerial manipulators to
collectively advance industry development. Addressing these research gaps could result in
more efficient, reliable, and comprehensive inspections of FOWTs, ultimately contributing
to the sustainable development and maintenance of offshore wind energy systems. This, in
turn, aids in reducing the cost per unit of energy and contributes to a more environmentally
friendly planet.
