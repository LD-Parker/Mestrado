Abstract. The global ﬂoating offshore wind energy industry is rapidly maturing, with several technologies hav-
ing been installed at pilot and demonstration scales. As the industry progresses to full array-scale deployments,
the optimization of marine activities related to installation, operation and maintenance, and decommissioning
presents a signiﬁcant opportunity for cost reduction. This paper reviews the various marine operations chal-
lenges towards the commercialization of ﬂoating wind in the context of spar-type, semi-submersible and tension
leg platform (TLP) technologies. Knowledge gaps and research trends are identiﬁed along with a review of in-
novations at various stages of development, which are intended to widen weather windows, reduce installation
costs, and improve the health and safety of ﬂoating-wind-related marine operations.
1 Introduction
Wind turbines are moving further offshore to deeper wa-
ters and are exploiting higher wind speeds in harsher en-
vironments (McCann, 2016). This trend creates additional
challenges in the design, installation, operation, maintenance
and decommissioning phases of an offshore wind farm. Nu-
merous investigations for developing efﬁcient and optimum
ﬂoating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) platforms and var-
ious innovative design concepts have been evolving in the
last few years (Uzunoglu et al., 2016; EWEA, 2013). Several
pilot- and demonstration-scale ﬂoating wind farms are now
operational in different parts of the world (e.g. WindFloat
Atlantic – Portugal (25 MW), Hywind Scotland (30 MW)),
and there is a robust pipeline of projects which is expected
to deliver 250 GW installed ﬂoating capacity by 2050 (DNV,
2020; James and Ros, 2015).
To realize this ambition, signiﬁcant reductions in LCOE
(levelized cost of energy) will be required across all key
stages in the development of a ﬂoating wind farm. Numerous
marine operations are required in the last three stages of theﬂoating-wind-farm life cycle (see Fig. 1). Marine operations
represent a signiﬁcant proportion of the offshore wind en-
ergy costs. Approximately 15.2 % of CAPEX (capital expen-
diture), 50 % of OPEX (operational expenditure) and 80 % of
DECEX (decommissioning expenditure) are directly related
to marine operations for a bottom-ﬁxed wind farm (Judge
et al., 2019). Comparative ﬁgures for the ﬂoating-wind-
energy industry are unavailable due to a lack of projects;
however, investigations by Castro-Santos (2016) show that
approximately 36 % of the total ﬂoating project costs are in-
curred during the installation, exploitation and dismantling
activities. Castro-Santos et al. (2018a) have revealed that the
size of the ﬂoating wind farms has a considerable impact on
installation costs and LCOE. It was found that the LCOE re-
duces as the farm size increases.
Given the nascent nature of the ﬂoating-wind-energy in-
dustry and the lack of established best practices, these opera-
tions present a signiﬁcant scope for optimization and cost re-
duction. The FOWT industry has a signiﬁcant second-mover
advantage and can beneﬁt from the technical expertise and
innovations developed in the offshore oil and gas (O & G)

and ﬁxed-wind-energy industries. However, the deployment
of highly dynamic unmanned ﬂoating platforms is unprece-
dented and requires the development of bespoke solutions
to reduce the cost and increase the safety of installation-,
operation and maintenance (O & M)-, and decommissioning-
related marine activities.
There is overlap across the life cycle for the various tech-
nologies and procedures for ﬂoating offshore wind turbines.
For example, assessment and prediction of metocean condi-
tions are always required for installation, O & M and decom-
missioning of ﬂoating wind farms. Towing vessels are also
required in all these operational phases of a wind farm. So,
it is beneﬁcial to combine all the studies in those areas and
investigate all of them together instead of treating them sep-
arately. The marine operations vary depending on the ﬂoater
used; hence while selecting the ﬂoater, it is important to have
a ﬁrm understanding of the marine operations required in
each phase of its life cycle. Since marine operations repre-
sent a signiﬁcant proportion of the total costs incurred for
a wind farm, this knowledge aids the precise modelling of
the costs. Many innovations have been recently introduced
or adapted from other industries to take advantage of array-
scale deployments possible for FOWTs. These innovations
are also needed to be examined from a marine operation point
of view. Since the ﬂoating-wind domain is new and matur-
ing, there is a shortage of literature that focuses on marine
operations. This paper examines the various challenges and
opportunities concerning marine operations during installa-
tion, O & M and decommissioning phases of a ﬂoating wind
farm.
2 Installation, O & M and decommissioning of FOWT
ﬂoater types
Floating wind platforms can be mainly classiﬁed into three
broad categories according to the restoring mechanism
for attaining hydrostatic equilibrium. They can be ballast-
stabilized, buoyancy-stabilized, mooring-stabilized or com-
binations of these (Leimeister et al., 2018; Banister, 2017;
Booij et al., 1999). Figure 2 demonstrates how the different
FOWTs developed around the world ﬁt into a stability trian-
gle.
Generally, the installation of ﬂoating wind turbines re-
quires a greater number of vessels compared to bottom-ﬁxed
wind turbines, but the vessels are cheaper to hire and eas-
ily available (Crowle and Thies, 2021). Even though many
ﬂoating-wind concepts have been developed, only a few have

been successfully deployed and commissioned at a commer-
cial level. In the following sections, a review of the projects
that have reached the Technology Readiness Level 7 (TRL7)
(EC, 2017) or above is provided with a focus on the marine
operation strategies which they employed.
2.1 Spar type: Hywind Scotland project
Hywind Scotland is a ﬂoating offshore wind farm which has
a rated capacity of 30 MW, produced from ﬁve 6 MW tur-
bines, and has been functioning since 2017 (Equinor, 2022b).
The spar-type ﬂoater, namely the Hywind concept, was de-
veloped by Equinor ASA (Equinor, 2022b; Skaare, 2017). A
2.3 MW demo (TRL 8) (OREC, 2015) was deployed on the
west coast of Norway in 2009 for a test run of 2 years (But-
terﬁeld et al., 2007; Equinor, 2022b). Following the demon-
stration, a wind farm was installed 30 km off the coast of
Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The farm has an area of approxi-
mately 4 km2and an annual average signiﬁcant wave height
of 1.8 m (Mathiesen et al., 2014).
The spar-type substructures have high draughts which re-
quire the use of offshore assembly. The installation phase
also requires sheltered coastal waters (maximum signiﬁcant
wave heights are up to 0.5 m and a Beaufort wind force 4;
DNV, 2015) for some operations. This is a challenge as shel-
tered waters with high depths are required near the construc-
tion sites due to the high draught of the ﬂoaters. They should
either be available near the ports or be made by dredging.

stallation of the suction anchors and the mooring lines. The

ﬂoaters were ﬁrst wet-towed out into a sheltered area using
tugboats. Then they were upended using water ballast. Later,
the water was pumped out and solid ballast (magnetite) was
ﬁlled using a rock installation vessel. The tower-and-rotor as-
sembly was mated with the ﬂoater later (Jiang, 2021). This
was done using the heavy-lift vessel, Saipem 7000 (Saipem,
2017). A notable feature of the Hywind installation was the
use of this expensive heavy-lift vessel. Signiﬁcant cost cuts
may be achieved by innovative installation methods in the fu-
ture by avoiding the use of such vessels. After the mating, the
wind turbines were towed to the location of the wind farm.
They were then connected to the pre-installed mooring lines,
and ﬁnal ballast corrections were performed.
Metocean assessments were performed before the com-
mencement of the project to check for suitable weather win-
dows for marine operations. The duration characteristics of
marine operations were predicted for various limiting con-
ditions of wind and waves for a full year (Mathiesen et al.,
2014). The months from April to September were found to
have the widest operational time windows. The inshore as-
sembly (upending, solid ballasting, heavy lift) and offshore
installation operations (anchor and mooring, transfer and in-
stallation of wind turbine generators, cables) were scheduled
and carried out in this period.
The operation and maintenance of the wind turbine
mounted on the spar-type substructure are similar to that of
a bottom-ﬁxed offshore wind turbine. A campaign-based in-
spection and monitoring scheme is planned for the FOWTs.
Maintenance and repairs of the sub-sea systems (foundation,
mooring system, cables) will follow a different approach.Periodic sub-sea inspections and maintenance will be per-
formed using ROVs (remotely operated underwater vehi-
cles). Scour might also be an issue concerning the Hywind
spar-type platforms as they employ suction anchors. Heavy
component exchanges up to 2 t will be performed using the
platform crane and a crew transfer vessel (CTV). Heavier
components like the transformer can be exchanged using a
dynamically positioned offshore service vessel. In the case
of even larger components, the turbines have to be towed to
a sheltered region, and exchange will be carried out using
heavy-lift vessels (H. H. Hersleth, 2016).
The decommissioning of the spar-type platforms could be
more expensive compared to other types of platforms. The
platform has to be partially decommissioned in deep water
due to the high draughts before getting towed to the quay-
side. The blades, nacelle and tower can be dismantled using
a heavy-lift vessel; this incurs additional costs. The moor-
ing lines and anchors also must be retrieved. Easily recov-
erable anchors can reduce decommissioning costs and time.
There is scope for further investigations to develop cheaper
and easy decommissioning strategies of spar-type FOWTs.
2.2 Semi-submersible type: WindFloat Atlantic and
Kincardine projects
In 2011, Principle Power installed a prototype semi-
submersible FOWT, namely WindFloat, 5 km off the west
coast of Portugal (Roddier et al., 2010). This was followed
by the installation of a 25 MW ﬂoating wind farm on the
west coast of Portugal. The wind farm consists of three MHI

Vestas 8.4 MW turbines mounted on Principle Power’s semi-
submersibles (Banister, 2017). The installation operations
were carried out with the help of tugs, AHTS (anchor han-
dling tug supply) vessels and ROV-support cable-lay vessels
supplied by Bourbon Offshore (Ocean-Energy-Resources,
2020). The towing operation took 3 d, taking the completely
assembled FOWT from the port of Ferrol, Spain, to the farm
located 20 km off the coast of Viana do Castelo, Portugal.
The AHTS, Bourbon Orca (Ulstein, 2022), was used for the
operations, which is an advanced vessel with a bollard pull
of 180 t and a maximum speed of 17.1 kn. Most AHTSs were
constructed to serve the O & G industry, but they make a
good choice for ﬂoating-wind-farm installation since there
is good availability, and they can be used for the installation
of anchors and for towing purposes. One of the ﬂoaters was
loaded out and ﬂoated off using a semi-submersible barge,
Boskalis Fjord . Compared to the Hywind project, specialized
expensive heavy-lift crane vessels were not employed here.
Castro-Santos et al. (2013) has observed that the installation
of anchoring and mooring systems is less expensive using an
AHTS compared to a combination of barges and tugboats.
The Kincardine offshore ﬂoating wind farm is another
project which employs semi-submersible ﬂoaters for the
wind turbines (offshorewind.biz, 2021). The wind farm is lo-
cated 15 km off the coast of Aberdeen, Scotland. It features
a wind farm with a nameplate capacity of 50 MW. All of the
ﬂoaters were constructed in Fene, Spain, and transported to
Rotterdam for mounting the 9.6 MW wind turbines (Umoh
and Lemon, 2020).
Semi-submersibles are buoyancy-stabilized ﬂoaters. The
stabilizing righting moment is contributed either by the large
water-plane area of the hull or small cross-sectional areas at
some distances from the central axis (Leimeister et al., 2018).
They can be fully constructed and assembled onshore. The
installation of mooring systems is less expensive compared
to other types of ﬂoaters, which makes semi-submersibles
one of the most cost-effective solutions from an installation
point of view (Liu et al., 2016). However, the construction
costs are higher compared to other types of ﬂoaters since they
are larger and heavier structures (James and Ros, 2015). The
semi-submersible wind turbines are completely constructed
onshore and towed to the wind farm location and connected
to the pre-installed mooring lines. Light drag-embedded an-
chors can be used for semi-submersibles. The main challenge
in the installation process is ﬁnding the right weather win-
dow for the marine operations as they are more sensitive to
wave heights during towing (Banister, 2017). The installation
of the three FOWTs in the WindFloat project took place in
October 2019, December 2019 and May 2020, respectively
(EDP, 2019, 2020). It is very important to assess the weather
windows and downtime before commencing marine opera-
tions. Another important aspect to be considered is the safe
havens. Towing of FOWTs is a continuous operation, and it is
difﬁcult to halt the operation during the process. Safe havens
should be identiﬁed along the route of the towing operationto avoid difﬁculties in case of harsh weather. Some of the
ﬂoaters in the WindFloat and Kincardine projects were con-
structed at a different location and transported to the assem-
bly port using specialized heavy-transport vessels. This can
be avoided by carefully choosing the right port with shipyard
facilities where the complete construction and assembly of
the FOWT can be carried out.
Operation and maintenance activities can be carried out
either offshore or onshore (Banister, 2017). The periodic in-
spections, preventive maintenance and repair activities will
be performed in situ (i.e. at the platform location). In case
of large corrective maintenance or repair activities, the plat-
form can be towed to a sheltered location or port. No heavy-
lift vessels are required, and local vessels can be used for
towing. This is beneﬁcial in terms of promoting the use of
local content and adhering to regulations such as the Jones
Act (B.Cheater, 2017), which requires the usage of US-built
ships for marine operations in the US waters. Due to the large
size of the ﬂoater, helipads can be constructed aboard, which
make access by helicopters possible. During decommission-
ing, the platform can be towed to shallow water or taken out
of the water completely inside a dry dock and dismantled.
2.3 Other upcoming projects
The Floatgen project by Ideol (France) is another project that
employs barge-type substructures (Alexandre et al., 2018;
Ideol, 2021). They can be fabricated using steel and concrete,
which can help promote the use of local content and employ-
ment. The damping pool technology developed by Ideol is
designed to stabilize the ﬂoater in harsh sea conditions. Two
demonstration projects have been in operation since 2018,
and pre-commercial and commercial projects are expected to
be launched in the coming years (Ideol, 2021).
Another ﬂoater concept is the tension leg platform (TLP),
which is widely used in the offshore O & G industry. This
concept has also been adapted from the O & G industry for
the FOWTs. Tension-leg-platform wind turbines (TLPWTs)
are well suited for intermediate water depths. The depth
varies from 70 m, which is an approximate upper limit for
ﬁxed wind turbines, to 200 m, beyond which the spar-type
platforms are considered to be the most economical option
(Bachynski and Moan, 2012).
In 2008, Blue H Technologies successfully installed a
prototype in Italy as a predecessor of commercial-scale
TLPWTs (Adam et al., 2014). Even though many concepts
have been developed, and a few prototypes have been re-
ported, commercial-scale TLPWTs are still not a reality. The
installation of a conventional TLP system is a complex pro-
cess. The tendons, which hold the platform in place, are usu-
ally installed before the platform. The TLP ﬂoater is con-
structed onshore and towed to the location using tugboats or
transported using a bespoke barge. The platform is ballasted
and connected to the pre-installed tendons. Finally, the plat-
form is de-ballasted to a draught where the tendons attain the

optimum tension, and the TLP is secured. The nacelle ac-
celeration and the dynamic tension on the mooring lines are
the critical operational parameters here. Low nacelle accel-
erations are required for the reliable operation of the wind
turbine, and low mooring line tensions ensure low weights of
gravity anchors and longer fatigue lives. Sclavounos et al.
(2010) investigated the hydrodynamic performance of the
TLP in various signiﬁcant wave height and water depth con-
ditions. It was found that the TLP is safe to be installed in
waters deeper than 50 m and signiﬁcant wave heights up to
14 m. Figure 4 illustrates the main components involved in
the installation.
The main challenge involved in the installation of a con-
ventional TLP is its unstable behaviour before connecting to
the tendons. For the installation of an O & G TLP, bespoke
barges are often used for transportation and positioning of
the system, which incurs additional expenditure (James and
Ros, 2015). The anchors and mooring line system used in
TLPs are designed to handle high tensions and are thereby
more complex than the semi-submersible and spar-type plat-
form systems. The tendons are susceptible to fatigue failure,
which makes TLPs expensive from an O & M point of view
also. Decommissioning of a TLP system is also expected to
pose some challenges due to the complexity of the mooringsystem. The platform has to be carefully released from the
tendons and towed back to the shore. The mooring lines and
anchors are removed later.
The GICON TLP (Adam et al., 2014; Kausche et al., 2018)
is another innovative concept. The TLP system is placed on
a ﬂoating slab and dry-towed to the location. The slab is then
ballasted, which submerges the TLP into the required ﬁnal
draught. Figure 5 shows this installation method proposed
by GICON. Analyses by Hartmann et al. (2017) found that
the transportation of the GICON TLP should be performed
only at a wind speed below 12 m s 1and a maximum towing
speed of 5 kn. There are many upcoming concepts that are de-
signed to allow alternative installation methods. An example
is the TetraSpar concept (Borg et al., 2020), which features a
tetrahedral ﬂoating structure equipped with a keel, which can
be ballasted and lowered into a certain depth on-site. The keel
can be air-ballasted and towed to the offshore location. Once
the mooring lines are hooked, the keel is lowered, and the
system starts acting like a spar-type platform. The TetraSpar
has been developed with the aim to implement large-scale
industrial production as it consists only of cylindrical tubes
bolted together. These platforms do not require specialized
vessels for installation since they can be towed using low-
cost and widely available tugs (Andersen et al., 2018). The

towing vessels and the FOWT must satisfy the stability cri-
teria set by a classiﬁcation society (Hartmann et al., 2017;
DNV, 2021). Even though small tugs can be used for towing,
this might not always be feasible for installation in deeper
seas, where higher waves may be encountered. It is advisable
to use larger towing vessels for such installations. During the
sinking operation of the ballast, the structure will be suscep-
tible to current loads also. Detailed analysis is required to
ascertain the motion and the loads on the tendons during this
operation.
As mentioned above, different types of FOWTs have ad-
vantages and disadvantages when it comes to installation,
O & M and decommissioning. Table 1 summarizes them ac-
cording to the type of ﬂoater. Signiﬁcant wave height, cur-
rent and wind speed restrictions apply to all marine activities.
Some are more sensitive to this, but generally, it is important
to overcome this restriction by precise weather monitoring
and forecasting (Emmanouil et al., 2020) or using innovative
ships and technologies.
3 Challenges and opportunities
Marine operation is deﬁned as “a generic term covering,
but not limited to the following activities, which are sub-
jected to the hazards of the marine environment: Load-out/
load-in, Transportation/ towage, Lift/Lowering (Offshore/In-
shore), Tow-out/tow-in, Float-over/ﬂoat-off, Jacket launch/-
jacket upend, Pipeline installation, Construction aﬂoat”
(DNV, 2011a). Clearly, many of the operations listed here
are applicable for ﬂoating wind farms.DNV (Det Norske Veritas) (DNV, 2011a, b) classi-
ﬁes marine operations into weather-restricted and weather-
unrestricted. The operation period TRis deﬁned as
TRDTPOPCTC: (1)
TRis the operation reference period, TPOPis the planned
operation period, and TCis the estimated maximum con-
tingency time for the marine operation. Weather-restricted
operations are marine operations with TRless than 96 h
andTPOPless than 72 h. This is the maximum period for
which the weather forecast is sufﬁciently reliable. Precise
weather forecasts and continuous monitoring are required
for weather-restricted operations. Towing operations must
be analysed based on this (DNV, 2011a). For the Kincar-
dine project, the towing took approximately 9–10 d (Brid-
get Randall-Smith, 2021). This can be considered to be a
weather-unrestricted operation (DNV, 2011a). Statistical ex-
tremes of metocean conditions must be considered for plan-
ning such an operation according to Table 2.
As mentioned before, the marine operations vary accord-
ing to the type of ﬂoater used. The challenge here is the op-
timization of the unavoidable marine operations throughout
the life cycle of the wind farm. The installation locations of
FOWTs present considerable challenges in terms of harsh
weather conditions and catastrophic events such as tsunamis.
There is a signiﬁcant opportunity to transfer knowledge and
technology from the mature O & G industry, for example, the
optimized marine operations, resource assessment and the
prediction of offshore weather conditions. The general ap-
proach for planning a marine operation is described in Fig. 6.
There is a lack of consensus on installation approaches,
costs and time for each task for ﬂoating offshore wind
farms. Multiple installation, O & M and decommissioning

approaches have been suggested for bottom-ﬁxed wind tur-
bines, and many of them can be adopted for ﬂoating wind
farms. But FOWTs also present additional challenges, for ex-
ample dynamic cables, mooring lines and longer real-world
operational windows. The most signiﬁcant challenges and
the opportunities for addressing them are discussed in the
following sections.3.1 Metocean assessment and analysis
One signiﬁcant challenge associated with FOWTs is predict-
ing the optimum meteorological and ocean conditions for de-
sign as well as operation of FOWTs. In general, metocean
data are required for planning installation, operation, mainte-
nance and decommissioning activities by predicting the suit-
able weather window and associated costs based on wind,
wave and current data (Jacobsen and Rugbjerg, 2005). More-
over, metocean conditions play an important role in site se-
lection, calculation of design loads for ﬂoaters and mooring
systems also. Wave and wind conditions also present safety
concerns during the transfer of the crew to the ﬂoating plat-
forms. The uncertainty associated with various environmen-
tal variables is of interest to all offshore operations concern-
ing renewables as well as the O & G industry. The high com-
plexity of the ocean environment makes it even harder to pre-
dict the operating conditions due to the presence of numer-
ous variables. Also, the availability of metocean data for a
particular location and period affects calculations. It is very

important to have a general understanding of the metocean
conditions of a particular geographical area to plan the con-
struction of wind farms. There are four main sources of meto-
cean data:
1. in situ measurements
2. numerical modelling
3. satellite measurements
4. pre-existing statistics and reports.
Among these, the in situ measurements provide the most
reliable metocean data. Even though in situ measurements
cannot provide long-term data and incur costs, it is advisable
to start taking in situ measurements once the location is de-
cided for a wind farm. Predictions using numerical models
can be validated and augmented using in situ measurement
data or satellite measurements. Long-term metocean data can
also be generated using hindcast data for a particular region.
A careful combination of all these will serve as a reliable data
set for planning installation, O & M and decommissioning
activities. Wind, waves and current are the most important
metocean parameters to be monitored and analysed for off-
shore wind installations. Wind, being the primary source of
power, can be measured using lidar or a satellite scatterome-
ter (Ahsbahs et al., 2018; Remmers et al., 2019); the former
has proved to be more accurate and continuous for a partic-
ular region of interest. Waves can be measured using multi-
ple buoys deployed at a particular location, microwave radarsystems (Teleki et al., 1978) or satellites. Current measure-
ments are made using current meters mounted below buoys
or using microwave radars. Large-scale geostrophic currents
can be measured using satellites (Dohan and Maximenko,
2010). Shore-mounted HF (high-frequency) radars can mea-
sure winds, waves and currents in coastal waters over a range
of 120 km from the shore (Wyatt, 2021). Various numerical
models exist for the precise calculation of metocean condi-
tions. SWAN (Booij et al., 1999) is a third-generation wave
model that can calculate random, short-crested waves in shal-
low waters and ambient current.
3.2 Environmental limits for installation, O & M and
decommissioning
The installation, O & M and decommissioning activities re-
quire precise monitoring and assessment of metocean con-
ditions in the planning phase itself. FOWTs are installed far
offshore to utilize the higher wind speeds. As wind speed and
wave heights are directly related, the installation and O & M
of a ﬂoating wind turbine can be more challenging compared
to a bottom-ﬁxed wind turbine. Many pre-hook-up activities
like site inspection surveys, installation of anchors, cable lay-
ing etc. are possible only during calm sea states. Periodic
maintenance and repairs also depend on the weather condi-
tions for safe crew transfer. Special operations, such as the
mating of a spar-type platform with a wind turbine, are difﬁ-
cult when the platform is unstable. The installation of TLPs

sit and installation (James and Ros, 2015).
also poses similar challenges as the platform itself is rela-
tively unstable before the connection to the tendons. Waiting
for suitable weather conditions can raise the costs, so a pre-
cise weather forecast is essential. Figure 7 shows the meto-
cean limitations during assembly, transit and installation of
different kinds of platforms.
DNV (2021) has deﬁned the motion criteria for various
marine operations. Anchor handling operations can be con-
sidered hazardous due to the high unexpected mooring loads
in adverse sea conditions. For safe performance, it is impor-
tant to deﬁne detailed operation and suspension criteria for
anchor handling operations. For example, the 3 h maximum
roll angle criterion can be used to compute the probability
of exceeding a limiting roll angle of 15, which should re-
main below 10 4. This criterion will ensure that the vessel
will not capsize during anchor handling operations (Wu and
Moan, 2017).
The operational limits and operability of marine opera-
tions are largely dependent on the critical events and the cor-
responding response parameters (Acero et al., 2016). For ex-
ample, for the lifting of the fully assembled wind turbine for
mating with a spar-type ﬂoater using a heavy-lift vessel, the
critical event is the failure of the lifting wire. The tension
on the wire varies according to the prevailing environmen-
tal conditions. The tension on the wire has to be determined,
and care should be taken to keep it below the breaking load
(including a factor of safety). Using numerical analyses, the
allowable environmental conditions that lead to the breaking
load should be determined, and they should be avoided. This
operation is similar to the mating of the transition piece on
a monopile foundation in the case of a bottom-ﬁxed wind
turbine (Acero et al., 2017). The only difference is the rel-
ative motion between the ﬂoating foundation and the wind
turbine. The motions of the foundation should also be con-
sidered in the analyses. The installation of a wind turbine
on a ﬂoating substructure using a ﬂoating crane vessel is a
complex procedure. Cozijn et al. (2008) determined the op-
erational limits of a similar installation operation. The lifting
and lowering of two topside modules onto an FSU (ﬂoating
storage unit) were analysed, and the critical parameters were
identiﬁed. Impact loads during the lowering phase were alsocalculated. The impact loads acting on the ﬂoater tip during
the mating procedure can also be a critical factor depending
on the structural design of the ﬂoater tip.
Towing is another marine operation that is signiﬁcant dur-
ing the installation, operation and maintenance, and decom-
missioning of FOWTs. Here the critical response parameter
is the tension on the towing line, which has to be kept be-
low the breaking load during the operation. During the tow-
ing of fully assembled FOWTs, one large towing vessel pro-
vides the required bollard pull for towing, and two or three
smaller tugs stabilize the motion of the ﬂoater and maintain
a straight-line course. DNV (2021) has provided the allow-
able motion and acceleration limits for these vessels used in
the operation. In all these cases, it is important to ascertain
the environmental conditions corresponding to the limiting
value of the response parameter. These conditions should be
compared with the metocean forecasts, and the decision of
whether the operation can be executed or not should be taken.
For long-duration projects a weather window analysis is per-
formed to predict the periods when the weather parameters
that affect the operations are below the threshold limits. Us-
ing hindcast data of a particular location, the weather down-
time (WDT) can be predicted, and decisions on important
marine operations can be made (Lambkin et al., 2019).
Signiﬁcant wave height and wind speed are two major fac-
tors that affect workability. Depending on the marine opera-
tion, multiple environmental factors need to be considered.
For example, wind speed is important for lifting operations,
and wind and current speeds are important for towing oper-
ations (Acero et al., 2016). Transfer of the crew for mainte-
nance activities becomes difﬁcult in high wave heights. Be-
yond a signiﬁcant wave height of 1 m, marine operations be-
come difﬁcult, and most operations halt at a swell of 1.5 m
(Lange et al., 2012). Raising this limit is essential for all ma-
rine activities concerning offshore structures. Table 3 shows
the signiﬁcant wave height and wind speed limits for var-
ious vessels used for marine operations involving FOWTs.
These limits can be raised by developing innovative ship de-
signs that have better hydrodynamic performance in rough
seas; walk-to-work vessels are one example. The possibil-
ity of outﬁtting existing vessels with motion-compensated
gangways should also be investigated. At the same time, spe-
cialized vessels are expensive to hire, which would raise the
costs.
3.3 Cost modelling of ﬂoating-wind marine operations
Installation, O & M and decommissioning costs depend on a
variety of factors and stakeholder engagements. It is very im-
portant to model the costs accurately over the whole life cycle
of wind farms. Figure 8 shows the important factors and in-
puts to be considered while modelling the costs of a ﬂoating
wind farm. To optimize marine operations, precise modelling
of the associated costs is required. The cost modelling of ma-
rine operations concerning FOWTs requires a detailed anal-

ysis of each phase of the life cycle and the vessels involved
in the processes. For array-scale deployments, innovations
like shared mooring and anchor systems can be implemented,
which would bring down costs. For O & M purposes, mod-
ern vessels like service operation vessels (SOVs) and walk-
to-work vessels ﬁtted with motion-compensated gangways
should be used considering the harsh sea conditions in the
deep seas where the FOWTs will be installed. Many good
models exist for bottom-ﬁxed wind turbines. Figure 9 shows
the breakdown of costs associated with a ﬂoating wind farm
compared to a bottom-ﬁxed wind farm. They can be extended
into ﬂoating wind farms depending on the type of ﬂoater
and the methodology of the various operations. The ﬂoating-
wind costs are less developed at the moment; hence new and
improved models are required for precise calculation of the
costs.
The installation costs consist of costs incurred for the in-
stallation of the wind turbine, ﬂoating platform, electric sys-tem, mooring and anchoring systems, and the start-up cost
(Castro-Santos et al., 2016). The installation costs of the
ﬂoating offshore wind platform depend on the port and ship-
yard costs, transportation and towing costs, and site installa-
tion costs. Draught restriction applies to many ports depend-
ing on the type of ﬂoater used. The spar-type platforms and
TLPs have higher draughts compared to semi-submersibles.
In such cases they have to be stored in a special storage area
(Castro-Santos et al., 2018b), or the port needs to be dredged,
which incurs additional costs. The electric system installa-
tion costs are composed of cable installation costs and sub-
station installation costs. For the installation of mooring and
anchoring systems, it is economical to use an anchor han-
dling vessel (AHV) compared to using barges and tugs (Way-
man et al., 2006). The costs vary according to the number of
anchors used in the wind farm. By the end of the installa-
tion of all the systems, the wind farm is commissioned, and

start-up costs are also incurred during its connection to the
electrical grid.
Installation costs strongly depend on the site location of
the wind farm. Maienza et al. (2020) investigated how the
factors like distance from the coast, distance from the near-
est port and sea depth inﬂuence the total cost of a wind farm
in Italian waters. A cost map for Italian national waters was
produced, indicating the total costs for a wind farm consist-
ing of 12 TLP FOWTs. Preliminary analysis showed that the
number of wind turbines has a considerable effect on the to-
tal cost. Doubling the number of turbines increased the cost
by 35 %, but quadrupling or increasing eightfold increased
the costs by 60 % and 80 %, showing a decrease in the rate at
which the total costs increase. The LCOE was found to de-crease with an increase in the farm size (Castro-Santos et al.,
2018a; Myhr et al., 2014). According to Castro-Santos and
Diaz-Casas (2015), the distance from the shore has a 36.3 %
inﬂuence on installation cost and 14.2 % on dismantling cost.
As the wind turbines move further into the sea, it is expected
that they will grow in size too to fully utilize the higher wind
speeds; 15 MW wind turbines are predicted to be used from
around 2030 and 20 MW turbines from 2037 in the UK ﬂoat-
ing offshore wind sector (OREC, 2015). The wind turbine
diameter is found to have a 15.9 % inﬂuence on the disman-
tling cost (Castro-Santos and Diaz-Casas, 2015).
O & M costs mainly consist of the corrective and preven-
tive maintenance costs throughout the whole life cycle of the
wind farm (Castro-Santos, 2016; Sperstad et al., 2016). To

minimize these costs, it is important to design reliable sys-
tems and efﬁciently monitor the health conditions of the tur-
bine system, ﬂoater, electrical installation, and mooring and
anchoring system. This is of high importance as the failure of
main components could result in considerable downtime as
the FOWT might not be accessible due to a lack of suitable
weather windows. A preliminary analysis by Dewan and As-
garpour (2016) considered using SOVs and towing vessels
for O & M of a ﬂoating offshore wind farm consisting of ﬁfty
8 MW semi-submersible wind turbines and investigated the
costs and downtime. The availability was found to be 91.4 %,
which was lower than ﬁxed-bottom wind turbines, because
of the towing of the platform to the shore for major repairs.
A detailed investigation is pending in this area to improve
the downtime by using better vessels (e.g. walk-to-work ves-
sels), helicopters (Maples et al., 2013) etc. for different types
of ﬂoaters. Easy-coupling-and-decoupling systems should
be developed to facilitate easy attachment and detachment
of FOWTs during major repairs. Advancements in robotics
have paved the way for the usage of robots for inspection
and maintenance; iFROG (Offshore-Engineer, 2020) is an
amphibious robot developed by InnoTecUK, ORE Catapult,
TWI Ltd. and Brunel University London which can clean
corrosion and bio-fouling from monopile surfaces. Using
remote condition-monitoring systems, crack initiation and
propagation, corrosion, pitting, rubbing etc. can be detected
(Tchakoua et al., 2014). Remote visual inspection devices
and acoustic emission detectors can record and transmit data
to the shore, and the data can be analysed using machine
learning models to enable accurate prediction of developing
hazards (Stetco et al., 2019).
Decommissioning is an environment-sensitive activity. It
is better to incorporate decommissioning studies in the de-
sign phase to avoid complications in the ﬁnal years of the
wind farm life cycle (20 years or more) (James and Ros,
2015; Castro-Santos, 2016). A reverse-installation approach
can be used for calculating the decommissioning costs of a
wind farm (Topham and McMillan, 2017). The main compo-
nents are the dismantling costs of the wind turbine, ﬂoating
platform, electric system, mooring and anchors. Some an-
chors, e.g. drag-embedded anchors, are easily recoverable,
which would save costs and time (González and Diaz-Casas,
2016). There is an additional cost due to the cleaning of the
wind farm site which is of environmental concern (Castro-
Santos et al., 2016). Some materials can be sold as scrap,
e.g. steel from the ﬂoater and copper from the electric ca-
bles, which would result in a negative cost (income) (Castro-
Santos et al., 2016).
Various stakeholders are involved in the construction of an
offshore wind farm. Proper planning and optimum utiliza-
tion of resources are very important in bringing down costs.
Weather restrictions during the marine operations would
cause the logistic costs to increase exponentially (Lange
et al., 2012). Often hiring offshore support vessels from
abroad invites large hiring costs. Specialized vessels alsoTable 4. Day rates of different types of vessels used in the FOW

raise costs; see Table 4. Depending on the location, optimized
use of local vessels and port facilities would help bring down
the associated costs.
3.4 Health, safety and environment (HSE)
One of the non-technical challenges that needs to be ad-
dressed is improving the HSE conditions during the com-
plete life cycle of ﬂoating offshore wind farms. HSE fac-
tors must be considered during all phases of the develop-
ment of the wind farm, but only the installation, O & M
and decommissioning phases are considered in this section.
Since the ﬂoating-wind technology is in its infancy, there is
a shortage of dedicated applicable rules and standards. Un-
til the development of such standards, it is advisable to fol-
low component- and process-speciﬁc standards used in the
bottom-ﬁxed-wind-turbine industry or O & G industry (Hut-
ton et al., 2016). Marine operations in general can follow
the various safety standards, codes and classiﬁcation society
rules accordingly.
Theoretically, the installation of FOWTs is less
environment-sensitive compared to ﬁxed offshore wind
turbines as most of them are constructed completely onshore
and towed to the offshore sites. Again, the type of ﬂoater
is a deciding factor here. The installation of anchors and
mooring lines can have a negative impact on the environ-
ment. Spar-type platforms and semi-submersibles employ
catenary moorings with long mooring lines that have a
larger footprint on the seabed, while TLPs do not because
they employ taut mooring lines (James and Ros, 2015).
Heavy-lift vessels are used during the installation of spar-
type platforms, which invites additional safety issues, but
there are well-deﬁned guidelines and standards available for
this operation. The installation of drag-embedded anchors
has less of an environmental impact compared to suction
or pile-driven anchors. The noise impact during hammer
piling is also an issue. However, the underwater noise during
the installation of FOWTs is less compared to bottom-ﬁxed
Wind Energ. Sci., 7, 903–924, 2022 https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-7-903-2022

wind turbines (Koschinski and Lüdemann, 2013). The
noise during hammer piling can be mitigated by carefully
engineering the piling process. By using the right speciﬁca-
tion of piles and drivers the noise can be reduced. Bubble
curtains can be created using underwater bubble pipes to
attenuate the blast and piling noise. Vibropiling is another
technique employing vibratory pile drive machines that
drive the pile by applying rapidly alternating forces, which
are quieter than impact piling machines (Nedwell et al.,
2003). Long-term post-installation noise measurements are
required to understand the effects of operational noises of
large wind turbines ﬁtted on ﬂoating foundations (Farr et al.,
2021; Koschinski and Lüdemann, 2013). The effects on
ﬁsh populations and marine mammals need to be studied
separately. Protected marine areas, migratory birds’ paths
and migratory marine life paths should be avoided while
selecting sites for offshore wind farms (Díaz et al., 2019).
The most challenging safety concern is access and egress
of personnel to and from FOWTs during repair and mainte-
nance activities. The FOWT and the vessel form a ﬂoating–
ﬂoating couple which makes access and egress challeng-
ing. Bump and jump can only be safely accomplished in
low wave heights, whereas walk-to-work systems increase
this wave height limit while providing safer means of ac-
cess and egress. For crew transfer onto FOWTs, SOVs with
relative-motion compensation are preferred over CTVs due
to higher operability limits and established practices. A pre-
cise weather forecast is also required for planning O & M op-
erations to avoid difﬁculties during the operations. Aboard a
FOWT, even the small motions of the ﬂoater get ampliﬁed
into large displacements at the nacelles and blades. This con-
tributes to severe motion sickness or reduced efﬁciency of
the personnel working on such structures. In the long-term,
these factors have to be considered in the design phase of
the FOWT itself to reduce the dynamic response in waves.
Remote O & M can also be considered to reduce the O & M
visits. FOWTs can be towed back to shore for O & M, which
makes them attractive from an HSE point of view.
After decommissioning, it is important to leave the site in a
similar condition as it was before the deployment of the wind
turbines. After the wind turbines are transported to the shore,
the mooring lines and anchors have to be removed. Certain
types of anchors offer easy removal, while others are difﬁcult
or impossible to remove. Extreme care should be taken while
removing cables from the sea. The complete removal of ca-
bles can cause severe damage and disruption to the seabed
and in most cases, they are left buried on-site (Topham and
McMillan, 2017). Following decommissioning, it is impor-
tant that equipment is well below the seabed and does not
pose a risk to ﬁshing or other marine activities. Where this is
not possible, these locations must be recorded and reported
to relevant local authorities. Post-decommissioning surveys
are conducted to ensure that no debris is left behind, and the
buried remnants are not causing obstructions.4 Innovations applicable to ﬂoating offshore wind
turbines
Signiﬁcant research is currently being conducted in the de-
velopment of efﬁcient and optimal ﬂoating wind turbines. To
decrease the costs associated with installation, O & M and
decommissioning operations, many innovative designs, pro-
cedures and technologies along with established best prac-
tices are required. Some aspects can be adopted from the
O & G industry; however, the unique nature of FOWTs re-
quires dedicated research and development. Some of the in-
novations applicable in this domain are discussed in this sec-
tion. These innovations are targeted at improving the op-
erability of vessels, widening weather windows, improving
HSE factors and reducing the need for complex marine oper-
ations.
4.1 Shared-mooring and shared-anchoring systems
For large ﬂoating offshore wind farms, the mooring lines and
anchors can be shared with multiple FOWTs, reducing total
mooring line length, saving construction material for anchors
and reducing the need for marine operations by optimizing
utilization of the installed infrastructure. In a shared-mooring
system (Fig. 10), the FOWTs are interconnected using moor-
ing lines, reducing the frequent connections to the seabed us-
ing anchors. In a shared-anchor system, a single anchor takes
multiple mooring lines, and the number of anchors can be re-
duced. Both these systems are practical for large wind farms,
and signiﬁcant cost reductions are achievable due to the sav-
ings in material and installation costs.
Many researchers have worked on these concepts for ap-
plication in the ﬂoating offshore wind domain. The technical
know-how of integrated mooring systems can be transferred
from the O & G industry. They have been employed in the
ﬂoating O & G platforms, and the technology is relatively
mature. Musial et al. (2004) have observed that individual
mooring and anchor costs are signiﬁcant for single-turbine
systems compared to a shared system.
Fontana et al. (2016) investigated the hydrodynamic per-
formance and loading analysis of shared anchors for various
FOWT conﬁgurations and found that shared anchors must
be structurally strong enough to handle loading from unex-
pected directions. Anchors with a directional preference in
their holding position and capacity are generally not suited
for multi-line moorings, but they can be adapted by extra
structural outﬁtting for handling mooring loads in various di-
rections (Diaz et al., 2016). The type of ﬂoater is also found
to have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the anchor forces. Bal-
akrishnan et al. (2020) analysed and compared the anchor
forces on a semi-submersible ﬂoater system and a spar-type
ﬂoater system and found that the anchor forces on the latter
were less. This is because spar-type platforms have less sur-
face area interacting with waves compared to that of a semi-
submersible.

Figure 10. Shared-anchor system (Fontana et al., 2018).
Goldschmidt and Muskulus (2015) investigated the per-
formance of coupled-mooring systems involving 1, 5 and
10 ﬂoaters in various conﬁgurations. Semi-submersible
ﬂoaters were arranged in a row and triangular and rectangu-
lar conﬁgurations separately, and the system dynamics were
studied. It was found that mooring system cost reductions
up to 60 % and total system cost reductions up to 8 % were
achievable using shared moorings. However, it was noted
that the displacements of the ﬂoaters were higher when the
number of ﬂoaters in the system increased, which would be
a problem for large wind farms. Further investigation is re-
quired to improve the behaviour of ﬂoaters in larger wind
farms. One of the main challenges in adopting a multi-line
system for FOWTs is the reduction in system reliability.
Failure of the multi-line system components can cause a
large number of FOWTs to detach and stay adrift. Hallowell
et al. (2018) investigated the reliability of a multi-line sys-
tem (100 wind turbines in a conﬁguration of 10 rows and
10 columns) compared to a conventional single-line system.
It was found that the reliability of a multi-line system reduced
considerably in extreme load conditions due to progressive
failures. Further research is required in this area to increase
the reliability of multi-line systems for FOWTs.
Geotechnical investigations are carried out at the anchor
site prior to the installation of anchors. Dedicated geotech-
nical investigation vessels are used for this. The cost of
geotechnical investigations is a function of water depth, site
conditions, pre-existing survey data and method of investi-
gation. The geotechnical site investigation costs are also de-
pendent on the number of anchors (Fontana, 2019). In a wind
farm with shared anchors, there is a signiﬁcant reduction
in the number of anchors. This would help to bring down
geotechnical site investigation costs. Fontana (2019) com-
pared the costs of installation and geotechnical site inves-
tigation for different farm sizes. It was found that a multi-line conﬁguration reduces the installation cost for wind farms
with 36 or more wind turbines. The geotechnical site inves-
tigation costs also get reduced with an increase in the size of
the wind farm but taper due to the diminishing of the perime-
ter effect (anchors in the perimeter share fewer FOWTs). In a
shared-mooring system, mooring lines can be interconnected
instead of connecting to the seabed. The critical parameters
are the tensions in the mooring lines and the loads acting on
the anchors. As mentioned before, the system is susceptible
to loading from multiple directions, and the reliability of the
system is dependent on the line taking the maximum tension.
The tension on the mooring line must be below the break-
ing load in all environmental conditions as well as extreme
events. The pad eye on the anchor is also subjected to loads
in various directions (Hallowell et al., 2018). Shared mooring
can also make access by large vessels difﬁcult. When FOWTs
are interconnected, it can cause hindrance for such vessels
with high draughts to approach the platform and transfer the
crew. The mooring architecture has to be designed in such a
way that vessels can safely pass between the FOWTs. Avail-
able depth at the farm location and the point at which the
mooring line is connected to the ﬂoater are deciding factors
here.
Detailed analyses are required to ascertain the dynamic
performance of a shared-mooring system and estimate the
increase in extreme and fatigue loads (Hall et al., 2014). The
feasibility of using shared-mooring systems for pilot-scale
ﬂoating wind farms was investigated by Connolly and Hall
(2019). It was found that signiﬁcant cost reductions can be
achieved by proper selection of wind farm layouts, moor-
ing line properties and platform displacements. The Hywind
Tampen is an upcoming ﬂoating wind farm that employs
shared anchors (Reuters, 2020). The optimized array-scale
installation procedure for the shared-mooring and shared-

anchoring systems and its effect on costs and time are yet
to be investigated.
4.2 Dynamic positioning for FOWTs
The FOWTs are generally positioned in the deep sea using
mooring lines. They have to be pre-installed using offshore
support vessels, which are expensive, and the process is time-
consuming. Precise engineering calculations are required to
design the mooring lines and anchors for offshore structures.
The water depth is a decisive factor that determines the
length of mooring lines and the costs associated with them.
In many cases, the seabed has to be analysed and pre-
pared depending on the type of anchors used for installation.
Semi-submersibles and spar-type ﬂoaters are moored using
a longer but simpler mooring system compared to TLPs,
but the TLPs employ complex anchors and vertically loaded
tendons with high load-bearing capacity. The conventional
steel tendons are heavy and thereby costly and impractical
for ultra-deep installations (Cummins and McKeogh, 2020).
Large expensive vessels will be required for transporting and
installing them in an array-scale wind farm, which would in-
crease the costs. A mooring system is considered impractical
and uneconomical for water depths greater than 1000 m (Ya-
mamoto and Morooka, 2005). At the moment, researchers
agree that the practical water depth limit for ﬂoating wind
turbines should be between 700 and 1300 m (Musial et al.,
2016). Developing a cable system for transferring electric-
ity from such depths is difﬁcult and impractical. But with
the development of better electricity storage technology, e.g.
efﬁcient hydrogen production and storage (Cummins and
McKeogh, 2020), FOWTs can be deployed in deeper waters.
Mooring systems will be less effective for station-keeping in
such cases.
Dynamic positioning has been often used for station-
keeping of ships and offshore structures in the O & G indus-
try for years. Offshore support vessels actively employ dy-
namic positioning systems (DPSs) for a variety of offshore
activities. Employing DPSs can be considered for FOWTs
in deeper waters. The water depth and sea-bottom condi-
tions do not affect the DPS; hence it can save mooring line,
seabed preparation and anchoring costs. The disadvantage of
the DPS is that it consumes a considerable amount of energy
the turbine produces. Xu et al. (2021) proposed the feasibility
of a dynamically positioned semi-submersible 5 MW ﬂoating
wind turbine in their paper. It was found that the DPS utilized
approximately 1 =2 of the total generated energy when the
current forces are not considered, and the ratio becomes 4 =5
when current forces are taken into account (Xu et al., 2021).
The concept has not been experimentally evaluated, and the
economics of the DP system have not been optimized.
Another scenario where the DPS can be useful is dur-
ing the crew transfer from an offshore support vessel to the
FOWT during operation and maintenance activities. Even
with the mooring lines attached, the platform is subject tomotions which make the transfer of personnel difﬁcult. In
such cases, the DPS would help to stabilize the FOWT and
help the safe transfer of the crew. Heavy-lift vessels can also
employ the DPS during heavy-lift operations in the deep sea
(e.g. mating of spar-type platforms, O & M). The economics
of using such systems for FOWTs are yet to be investigated.
4.3 Walk-to-work for FOWTs
Operation and maintenance of offshore platforms are often
challenging due to the difﬁculty in accessing the platforms.
Safe transfer of the crew is essential for all kinds of main-
tenance activities concerning offshore structures. Access to
O & G platforms and bottom-ﬁxed wind platforms has al-
ways been challenging. In the case of ﬂoating platforms, it is
even more challenging as the platform and the crew transfer
vessel are in relative motion during transfer. Since ﬂoating
wind technology is relatively new, it is necessary to use the
knowledge acquired in the O & G and ﬁxed-wind domain for
ﬂoating platforms (Santos et al., 2016).
Walk-to-work (W2W) vessels are equipped with motion-
compensated gangways (MCGs) that enable crew transfer in
higher wave heights. They help to widen operational weather
windows and eliminate the waiting time, which saves time
and expenses. They can also be employed during installa-
tion activities for the transfer of the crew. The MCGs em-
ploy a technology known as active motion compensation
(Chung, 2016). Accurate motion sensors detect vessel mo-
tions and counteract them using a sophisticated hydraulic
hexapod on which the gangway is mounted. Motion detection
and hydraulics are governed by an automated control system.
MCGs allow crew transfer in signiﬁcant wave heights up to
3.5 m and wind speed up to 20 m s 1(Salzmann et al., 2015).
Guanche et al. (2016) investigated the hydrodynamic per-
formance of a catamaran crew transfer vessel (CTV24) with
a fender and a platform support vessel (PSV80) with an
MCG, and the operating signiﬁcant wave height conditions
were compared. It was found that access was theoretically
possible with wave heights up to 2 m using the catamaran
and 5 m using the PSV in head seas (Guanche et al., 2016).
In a separate study, accessibility was calculated for a semi-
submersible located off the coast of Portugal using hind-
cast data from 1980–2013. Safe access was possible up to
20 % and 76 % of the time using the catamaran and PSV , re-
spectively (Martini et al., 2016). Li (2021) further investi-
gated the operability of such systems by also taking second-
order drift motions into consideration. It was noticed that the
general wave height limit reduces to 2–3 m when nonlinear
drift forces were involved. Both investigations revealed that
beam seas are to be avoided in all cases when employing
W2W vessels for access. However, all these studies indicate
that W2W vessels equipped with MCGs are considerably ad-
vantageous over conventional access systems for ﬂoating-
wind-platform access. The complex motion of the multi-

body system requires further studies to ensure the safety of
the crew during such operations.
4.4 Specialized ships for FOWT -related marine
operations
Even though many FOWTs do not need specialized instal-
lation vessels, innovative vessel designs that could simplify
the installation processes are worth investigating. Many of
the ﬂoater types can be constructed onshore and towed to the
location by using tugs. An exception to this is the spar-type
platforms. They need heavy-lift vessels for the platform–
turbine mating process. There is potential for developing in-
novative ship designs that can facilitate cheaper and safer ma-
rine operations compared to the existing methods. One pub-
lic competition we can examine to give insight into this hap-
pened in 2014, when Statoil (now Equinor ASA) presented
the “Hywind Installation Challenge” (Equinor, 2022a) that
sought out innovative installation technologies and methods
for the installation of the Hywind wind turbines.
Stavanger-based Windﬂip AS proposed an innovative ves-
sel design that can be used for the installation of ﬂoating
offshore wind platforms (Maritime-Journal, 2012). The pro-
posal was based on a specialized barge that can transport a
fully assembled spar-type platform to the location and unload
by ﬂipping. The turbine is loaded in an almost-horizontal po-
sition, and the barge is towed to the offshore location. The aft
side of the barge is then ballasted, taking the whole barge–
turbine system into a vertical position. The turbine is then
connected to the mooring lines, and the barge is towed back
to the quayside for reloading. Windﬂip AS claims that the
vessel can operate in shallow waters, which is an advantage
when it comes to the installation of spar-type platforms.
Another concept was proposed by Jiang et al. (2020) to
aid the installation of spar-type platforms. A ﬂoating dock
(Fig. 11) was speciﬁcally designed for shielding a wind tur-
bine during the installation of the tower, nacelle and rotor
onto a spar-type platform. Hydrodynamic evaluation showed
that the ﬂoating dock was able to reduce the pitch and heave
response of the spar-type platform, which aids mating of the
blades.
Two different spar designs of different geometrical prop-
erties were tested during the analyses. The RAO (response
amplitude operator) plots show that the shielding provided
by the ﬂoating dock helps to reduce the motion of the spar
platforms inside (Fig. 12). However, sloshing mode and pis-
ton mode resonances were observed, which was a result of
the small inner diameter of the dock. Even though the ﬂoat-
ing dock is theoretically feasible, the towing and ballasting
operations are not yet studied. The structural design of the
ﬂoating dock is also required for analysing the internal com-
partment and fatigue of the gate and storage modules. De-
tailed cost analyses are also required to check whether the
construction, hiring and operation of the ﬂoating dock are
economically feasible.
Figure 11. Floating dock concept (Jiang et al., 2020).
Jiang et al. (2018) investigated another concept, a cata-
maran wind turbine installation vessel equipped with grip-
pers that aid the installation of spar-type platforms. The ves-
sel can carry a maximum of four wind turbines and mini-
mize or eliminate the use of heavy-lift vessels and thereby
reduce installation time. Figure 13 explains the various stages
in the installation of a spar-type platform using the cata-
maran vessel. Jiang et al. (2018) studied the hydrodynamic
performance of the system involving the catamaran, a spar
foundation, mechanical couplings, mooring lines and a dy-
namic position system using the multi-body approach. The
success of the mating is largely dependent on the relative
motion between the spar and the wind turbine tower. The
relative-motion radius (distance between the spar and wind
turbine tower), gripper forces and the mooring line tension
were the critical parameters in this process. The system was
simulated under various signiﬁcant wave height, peak period,
wind speed and blade pitch conditions. The signiﬁcant wave
height was found to be the most important environmental pa-
rameter that affects the performance of the system. A maxi-
mum signiﬁcant wave height of 3 m was used for the analy-
ses, and the mating process was found to be successful. The
disadvantage here is the complex mechanical structural ar-
rangement and various dynamic loads acting on the system.
Vågnes et al. (2020) proposed an improved system using
winches and wires instead of grippers. This system can re-
duce the structural requirements of the lifting system and im-
prove the handling of the wind turbines. The system will be
installed aboard a catamaran vessel which can be used for
the installation of spar-type platforms. The low-height lifting
system is controlled by an active heave compensation system
and tension tugger wires to ensure the balance of the tower

during the mating process. Preliminary hydrodynamic anal-
yses of the system under various weather conditions and op-
erational layouts showed that the system is feasible and can
be efﬁciently used for the installation of spar-type platforms.
The system was tested for various signiﬁcant wave height
and peak period conditions. The tensions on the lifting, sta-
bilizing and attachment wires were the critical parameters.
The natural periods of the FOWT were unlikely to be present
at common installation locations, but those of the catamaran
and spar are likely to be present. The analyses were focused
only on the positioning of the wind turbines; detailed anal-
yses of the lowering and mating processes are necessary to
evaluate the feasibility of the system. The performance ofthe system under various wind, wave and current conditions
and experimental validation of these results are also pending.
5 Conclusions
The importance of focussing research on the marine oper-
ations concerning installation, O & M and decommissioning
of FOWTs is discussed in this paper. As the industry matures,
much research is needed to frame innovative methods and
technologies to reduce the costs and LCOE. Compared to the
O & G industry, offshore wind turbines provide opportunities
for batch production and deployment. These opportunities
should be utilized for the full commercialization of ﬂoating

wind farms. Semi-submersibles are observed to be the most
cost-efﬁcient design from an installation, O & M and decom-
missioning point of view, but broader research is needed to
consider all the factors applicable to the whole life cycle of
the wind farms. Several challenges are yet to be addressed to
reduce the costs concerning spar-type platforms and TLPs. It
is very important to consider the ease of installation, O & M
and decommissioning in the design phase of the ﬂoater con-
cepts for the practical realization of these concepts. There is
also plenty of room for innovation to cut costs, reduce en-
vironmental impact and improve the safety of the personnel
associated with the industry.
Many challenges need to be addressed, and much research
is pending in the FOW domain. Some of the challenges are
speciﬁc to the type of ﬂoater, but others apply generally.
There is much research to be done for the easy and cost-
effective installation, O & M and decommissioning of TLPs.
It is important to introduce and implement innovative and
cost-effective methods and technologies in this domain. Ma-
rine operations, due to the involvement of human life, envi-
ronment and marine life, are of paramount importance. They
are most dependent on metocean conditions, so accurate pre-
diction is important. In situ measurements should be encour-
aged for getting accurate weather data throughout the life
cycle of the wind farm. Sharing of these data across mul-
tiple platforms should also be encouraged for the metocean
analyses of upcoming wind farms and further research. Ma-
rine operations can be improved in two different ways, i.e.
either by developing better metocean prediction models, for
example, analytical models augmented by in situ measure-
ments, or improving the operability of vessels in harsh seas
by implementing innovative technologies and methods. Spe-
cialized vessels are expensive, but by reducing costs in other
areas they can lead to reductions in the overall LCOE. Gen-
erally, O & M operations have stricter weather restrictions
compared to installation operations (e.g. towing). Emphasis
should be given in this area, and the O & M weather con-
ditions should be used as limiting cases for the metocean as-
sessments. As the industry matures, it is very likely that there
will be a huge demand for offshore support vessels (OSVs),
AHTSs, SOVs etc. in the near future. The industry should be
able to supply the vessels according to the demand or else
the costs will rise. Marine operations and vessel utilization
must be optimized to reduce the LCOE of ﬂoating offshore
wind energy and increase competitiveness with other energy
sectors.
