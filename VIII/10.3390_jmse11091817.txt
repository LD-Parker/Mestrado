Abstract: Offshore wind energy installations in coastal areas have grown massively over the last
decade. This development comes with a large number of technological, environmental, economic,
and scientiÔ¨Åc challenges, which need to be addressed to make the use of offshore wind energy
sustainable. One important component in these optimization activities is suitable information from
observations and numerical models. The purpose of this study is to analyze the gaps that exist in the
present monitoring systems and their respective integration with models. This paper is the second
part of two manuscripts and uses results from the Ô¨Årst part about the requirements for different
application Ô¨Åelds. The present solutions to provide measurements for the required information
products are described for several European countries with growing offshore wind operations. The
gaps are then identiÔ¨Åed and discussed in different contexts, like technology evolution, trans-European
monitoring and modeling initiatives, legal aspects, and cooperation between industry and science.
The monitoring gaps are further quantiÔ¨Åed in terms of missing observed quantities, spatial coverage,
accuracy, and continuity. Strategies to Ô¨Åll the gaps are discussed, and respective recommendations
are provided. The study shows that there are signiÔ¨Åcant information deÔ¨Åciencies that need to be
addressed to ensure the economical and environmentally friendly growth of the offshore wind
farm sector. It was also found that many of these gaps are related to insufÔ¨Åcient information about
connectivities, e.g., concerning the interactions of wind farms from different countries or the coupling
between physical and biological processes.

1. Introduction
The offshore wind energy sector has grown massively worldwide since the Ô¨Årst wind
park at sea was commissioned in Denmark in 1991. The building of offshore wind parks
has accelerated over the last decade, and this development will likely continue at least until
the middle of this century [ 1]. According to the European Union (EU) Strategy on Offshore
Renewable Energy [ 2], the installed offshore wind capacity in Europe will grow by a factor
of Ô¨Åve, from 12 GW today to 60 GW by 2030. The Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC)
Market Intelligence forecasts that by 2030, more than 205 GW of new offshore wind capacity
will be added globally, including at least 6.2 GW of Ô¨Çoating offshore wind power [ 3]. This
development is driven by very ambitious and concrete goals deÔ¨Åned by politics, e.g., to
achieve climate neutrality by 2050 in Europe. In Germany, a target of 30 GW installed

offshore wind power by 2030 is written in law, which means an almost quadrupling of
the capacity that existed in 2022. In the wider European context, the development of new
offshore wind farm (OWF) activities also takes place in new areas with currently little or no
existing OWFs. These areas include the Northern Baltic Sea and Mediterranean Sea, with
challenges speciÔ¨Åc to these regions. As the development of new OWFs is expected to be
fast and local legislation may be behind, best practices from other, previously developed
regions should be utilized, and approaches and impacts potentially harmful to the society
and environment should be avoided.
The growth of the OWF sector comes with a large number of scientiÔ¨Åc and technologi-
cal challenges [4,5], e.g., in the Ô¨Åelds of:
o OWF design and planning;
o Installation of OWFs;
o Operation and maintenance (O&M) of OWFs;
o Environmental impact assessments;
o Dismantling, repowering, or recycling of OWFs.
The sustainable evolution of offshore wind energy technology in terms of cost ef-
Ô¨Åciency and environmental impacts requires detailed information about the two-way
interaction between the OWFs and their environment [ 6]. A key component to meeting this
demand is dedicated monitoring systems that are integrated with up-to-date numerical
models for the environment and the technology. The combination of simulation tools
and observations for speciÔ¨Åc-use cases has gained new attention in the context of digital
twins [ 7], which are seen as an efÔ¨Åcient tool for decision making. In [ 8], an overview of the
requirements for integrated information was provided from observations and modeling.
In the current study, we perform a gap analysis to evaluate to what extent the current
observation and modeling capabilities are sufÔ¨Åcient for providing the required information
during different lifetime phases of OWFs. We identify what capabilities are still missing
and how these can potentially be developed.
Gap analysis is applied in different Ô¨Åelds, e.g., in the private sector, and is seen as a
powerful tool to develop and grow business [9]. More speciÔ¨Åcally, it helps to:
 DeÔ¨Åne priorities;
 Identify areas for improvement;
 Allocate resources in a strategic way;
 Measure progress in an objective way;
 Achieve goals within a given time frame.
A variety of observation gap analysis methods have been investigated in the Ô¨Åeld
of operational oceanography, which can be divided into two categories: one is to assess
data adequacy for reconstructing a four-dimensional, continuous ocean state [ 10,11]; the
other is to assess data adequacy to Ô¨Åt for certain given purposes, e.g., operational forecast,
environmental assessment or offshore wind farm siting [ 12]. The Ô¨Årst type of method
quantitatively evaluates a data impact index, e.g., ‚Äúeffective coverage‚Äù, ‚Äúsampling error‚Äù,
or ‚Äúinitial uncertainty‚Äù, for a given sampling scheme. Observing system simulation experi-
ments (OSSEs) fall into this category as well. Here, the quality of observations is assessed in
terms of the ability to improve model forecasts in a data assimilation scheme using general
statistical parameters like RMSE or using a more basic approach based on assumptions
about the correlation structure of the model errors [ 11]. The Ô¨Åt-for-purpose gap analysis, on
the other hand, consists of three stages. The Ô¨Årst stage is to deÔ¨Åne an application area, e.g.,
offshore wind farm siting and tailored products needed for this service; then, all the avail-
able observations and modeling approaches will be used to generate the tailored products;
Ô¨Ånally, adequacy of the observations is assessed according to experiences in generating
the products. This method can be either qualitative or quantitative. A Ô¨Åt-for-purpose data
adequacy assessment was performed for OWF siting in the Baltic Sea [ 13]. In EMODnet
(European Marine Observation and Data Network) CheckPoint projects, data adequacy in
multiple application areas, such as OWF siting, oil slick forecasting, river discharge, climate

change, and Ô¨Åshery management, was assessed for European regional seas [ 12]. However,
these applications were analyzed separately.
In this study, we apply a Ô¨Åt-for-purpose gap analysis with reference to requirements
for the OWF sector identiÔ¨Åed in [ 8]. In that study demands concerning observations were
identiÔ¨Åed and discussed for the six application Ô¨Åelds, which differ in characteristic temporal
and spatial time scales. The focus of the study was on aspects with high connectivity either
across spatial scales, system compartments (e.g., atmosphere/ocean), or ecosystems.
(1) Operation and maintenance (O&M);
(2) Submarine cables;
(3) Wake and lee effects;
(4) Transport and security;
(5) Contamination;
(6) Ecological impacts.
Gap analyses have been performed in the context of offshore wind energy in a number
of studies. For example, [ 14] performed a study about monitoring gaps in the ecosystem in
the Dogger Bank region. Data gaps with regard to offshore wind resource assessments and
optimal designs were discussed in [ 15,16]. A gap analysis concerning rules, regulations,
and standards is provided by [ 17,18]. Missing knowledge about the impacts of sea power
cables on the environment is discussed in [ 19]. An early report about guidelines for data
acquisition to support marine environmental assessments for offshore renewable energy
projects was given by [ 20]. The general importance of the topic was discussed in various
documents, e.g., a recent report by the European Marine Board [ 21] stated that the ‚Äúlack of
sustained funding for Ocean observations and marine monitoring has created the lack of
baseline knowledge across European seas needed to develop the ORE (Offshore Renewable
Energies) required by European ambitions.‚Äù
The present study extends and complements the existing investigations in different
ways, e.g.,
(1) Oceanic and air/sea interaction aspects are put into the focus;
(2) The discussion is centered around Ô¨Åt-for-purpose information products for different
use cases;
(3) Particular focus is put on high connectivity aspects, which are of high importance for
decisions about trans-European monitoring strategies;
(4) The discussion includes physical, chemical, and ecosystem aspects.
The manuscript is structured as follows: In Section 2, a short description is provided
of the methodology applied for the gap analysis. In Section 3, a very brief introduction
is presented of the six use cases and the existing modeling and monitoring capacities are
summarized. Different European countries are used as examples to explain the present
situation. In Section 4, gaps in the existing monitoring systems and model integrations are
summarized. In Section 5, these gaps are discussed in a larger context and recommendations
are formulated. Finally, Section 6 provides a summary and conclusions.
2. Methodology for Gap Analysis and Input Data
In this section, a brief introduction is given to the general concept of a gap analysis.
This includes the objectives, as well as characteristic properties of the method as an opti-
mization tool. In addition, several aspects are discussed, which have to be considered when
using this approach in the context of observation systems in the offshore wind energy sector.
The gap analysis conducted in this study follows general principles used in different
contexts and in particular in the business sector [ 22]. Four basic steps need to be considered
in the analysis (see Figure 1):
1. A desirable target scenario has to be deÔ¨Åned;
2. The current situation has to be assessed;
3. Gaps have to be identiÔ¨Åed;
4. Strategies to Ô¨Åll the gaps have to be developed.

The target scenario should comply with the SMART principle, i.e., it should be speciÔ¨Åc,
measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. The target scenarios for offshore wind
energy are very speciÔ¨Åc for Europe, including deÔ¨Ånitions of very ambitious timelines. The
growth of OWF installations can be measured in terms of installed power, but it is clear
that this metric is not sufÔ¨Åcient for a holistic assessment of the technology. Apart from
the energy costs for the Ô¨Ånal consumer, the safety of the energy supply and potential
societal and environmental impacts have to be considered as well. The deÔ¨Ånition of
respective metrics to measure the Ô¨Åtness of the associated monitoring systems and progress
in the implementations is even more challenging. The Ô¨Ånal goal should be to answer the
following question:
 How well do the observations Ô¨Åt for the purposes of applications in terms of cost
efÔ¨Åciency and environmental friendliness in technology and operations, and where
are the gaps?
The most underdeveloped part of such assessments is the quantiÔ¨Åcation and evaluation
of environmental damages in relation to economic beneÔ¨Åts. This is related to the deÔ¨Ånition
of concepts like ‚Äúgreen economy‚Äù, which still requires further sharpening [ 23]. In this study,
we will not enter into the broader political and ethical dimension of this debate but rather
concentrate on the more technical aspects. We will, however, include discussions on data
policies as well as the communication between different actors in the offshore wind sector
because they are of direct relevance to the efÔ¨Åcient use and evolution of monitoring systems.
The gap analysis presented here is based on the identiÔ¨Åcation of requirements given
in [8] and covers a variety of aspects:
 Availability and suitability of sensors;
 Observation coverage in time and space;
 Observation accuracies;
 Observation consistency (metadata, validation procedures, etc.);
 Use of observations in combination with models for model optimization, assimilation,
and validation.

wind¬†energy¬†are¬†very¬†specific¬†for¬†Europe,¬†including ¬†definitions ¬†of¬†very¬†ambitious ¬†time‚Äê

it¬†is¬†clear¬†that¬†this¬†metric¬†is¬†not¬†sufficient ¬†for¬†a¬†holistic¬†assessment ¬†of¬†the¬†technology. ¬†Apart¬†
from¬†the¬†energy¬†costs¬†for¬†the¬†final¬†consumer, ¬†the¬†safety¬†of¬†the¬†energy¬†supply¬†and¬†potential ¬†
societal¬†and¬†environmental ¬†impacts¬†have¬†to¬†be¬†considered ¬†as¬†well.¬†The¬†definition ¬†of¬†re‚Äê

in¬†the¬†implementations ¬†is¬†even¬†more¬†challenging. ¬†The¬†final¬†goal¬†should¬†be¬†to¬†answer¬†the¬†

‚óè How¬†well¬†do¬†the¬†observations ¬†fit¬†for¬†the¬†purposes ¬†of¬†applications ¬†in¬†terms¬†of¬†cost¬†
efficiency ¬†and¬†environmental ¬†friendliness ¬†in¬†technology ¬†and¬†operations, ¬†and¬†where¬†
are¬†the¬†gaps?¬†

tion¬†of¬†environmental ¬†damages ¬†in¬†relation¬†to¬†economic ¬†benefits.¬†This¬†is¬†related¬†to¬†the¬†def‚Äê
inition¬†of¬†concepts ¬†like¬†‚Äúgreen¬†economy‚Äù, ¬†which¬†still¬†requires¬†further¬†sharpening ¬†[23].¬†In¬†

Service (CMEMS). For in situ observations, metadata are obtained from both EMODnet
and national databases, which consist of in situ observations from operational agencies, en-
vironmental monitoring, geological survey, and Ô¨Åshery monitoring from Denmark, Finland,
Germany, Netherland, Norway, and Spain. In addition, data from research infrastructures
such as Danubius, ICOS-OTC, EURO-ARGO, and the suite of JERICO (Joint European Re-
search Infrastructure of Coastal Observatories) projects are used, highlighting the essential
importance of the ESFRI (European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures) activities
for sustainable development of OWFs and use of ocean energies. For some application
areas, research and commercial observations are also used. Information about OWF instal-
lation plans was gathered from different sources, e.g., OSPAR (Oslo and Paris Conventions)
and documents issued by national agencies, e.g., the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic
Agency in Germany (BSH) [ 24]. The authors are taking part in the JERICO-S3 (Joint Eu-
ropean Research Infrastructure of Coastal Observatories: Science, Service, Sustainability)
project and are familiar with the latest developments in the ocean monitoring sector both
on the European level and on the national level.
The focus of the analysis is on gaps concerning information products, that require
knowledge about processes with high connectivity. We are using the term connectivity
in a wider sense, such that it includes both connectivity in the spatial dimension and
connectivity across different processes including human activities.
3. Existing Monitoring and Modeling Capacity
In this section, a very short introduction is given to the different use cases, and
the main overall information requirements identiÔ¨Åed in [ 8] are summarized. The main
technological and environmental components, as well as a number of key parameters
addressed in this study, are visualized in Figure 2. Subsequently, present solutions to
provide the required observations in combination with model simulations are presented.
The solutions are discussed using the situation in a number of European countries as an
example. Experiences from existing solutions are analyzed, and recommendations for
the further development of OWF in other regions are provided. The evolution of OWF
is diverse in European seas, and the discussion uses a limited number of regions with
interesting developments as examples, namely the southern North and Baltic Seas, the
northern North/Norwegian and Baltic Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea.

3.1. OWF Inspection and Maintenance
Operation and maintenance (O&M) costs constitute a substantial part of the total
Ô¨Ånancial investment required for OWF project lifecycles [ 25]. With about 14‚Äì30% of the
total expenditure spent on O&M [ 26], the optimization of the respective procedures and
technologies is of vital importance to make offshore wind proÔ¨Åtable and economically
sustainable. Ship operations are a particularly relevant component in this context since
the costs for vessels sum up to about 50% of the total O&M costs, with typically about
six visits required per year for mostly minor O&M activities at each turbine [ 27,28]. For
the optimized use of ship time, reliable information about environmental conditions is
crucial [ 29]. For example, depending on the ship type, limits exist for the signiÔ¨Åcant wave
height H s, at which crew transfer vessels (CTVs) are allowed to transfer personnel to the
turbines (e.g., 1 m for Monohull or 1.2 m for Catamaran). Environmental information
is furthermore required in the context of predictive maintenance, which is of relevance
in the context of corrosion [ 30] or structural health [ 31]. For the monitoring of the aging
process, dedicated measurements of the structure response to wind, waves, or currents
are of interest, e.g., obtained from strain sensors or accelerometers [ 32]. In particular, with
regard to corrosion protection, possible environmental impacts are of concern as well. The
general topic of pollution will be discussed in more detail in Section 3.5.
3.1.1. Existing Monitoring Solutions for O&M
The most important variables for O&M are waves and currents. In the European
seas, CMEMS provides 30-year altimetry data (signiÔ¨Åcant wave height, wind speed, and
sea level anomaly). Regular along-track products have a resolution of about 7 km, while
5 Hz products provide 1.2 km resolution data, which greatly increases the availability of
coastal, especially nearshore, observations. EMODnet has data from 219 wave buoys in
the Baltic‚ÄìNorth Sea. For currents, the Baltic‚ÄìNorth Sea is well covered by 116 mooring
stations. In addition, there are 11 HF radars in the North Sea [ 33]. This provides a base
for solid model validation in the Baltic‚ÄìNorth Sea scale. A more detailed overview of the
observations in German waters is provided below.
In situ: The core element of the in situ observation system along the German coast
is the network of tide gauges with about 19 stations in the German Bight and 32 stations
in the Baltic. A signiÔ¨Åcant number of additional tide gauges can be found upstream
the rivers (e.g., Elbe, Weser, Ems). Nine stations of the MARNET network (MARitimes
UmweltmessNETzwerk) operated by BSH measure salinity, temperature, and surface
currents. Furthermore, about nine wave buoys provide sea state information [ 34]. Within
the pre-operational Coastal Observing System for Northern and Arctic Seas (COSYNA), a
number of stationary and mobile platforms measure physical, geochemical, biological, and
key sediment variables [ 35]. The research center Hereon operates three HF radar stations to
measure surface currents in the German Bight [ 36], and it has operated gliders for certain
periods as well as FerryBox systems both on ships and as stationary systems. Regular
measurement campaigns are performed with ships (e.g., Ludwig Prandtl), e.g., including
scanÔ¨Åsh measurements. Dedicated airborne campaigns to analyze the OWF impacts on sea
state were conducted by the University of Braunschweig [37,38].
Very few open-access operational measurements are taken dedicated to the offshore
windfarm topic. One exception is the FINO-1 platform located next to the Ô¨Årst German
offshore wind park Alpha Ventus. Because of the rapid growth of installations in the
vicinity, this platform is not suitable any more to measure free stream conditions.
Remote sensing: In general, the operational use for OWF applications in coastal areas
is still quite rare. For Germany most of the use is in the context of scientiÔ¨Åc studies or in test
setups at operational centers. Hereon has used satellite SST and altimeter data for validation
and assimilation of circulation and ocean wave models along the German coast. Optical
satellite data were used to study sediment transport processes and for data assimilation.
Furthermore, satellite radar data were used to study high-resolution wind Ô¨Åelds around
OWFs, e.g., wake effects. BSH is using satellite data (e.g., SST) in pre-operational setups for
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

data assimilation. Most of the satellite data are accessed via CMEMS (Copernicus Marine
Environment Monitoring Service), but in some cases (e.g., TerraSAR-X or CFOSAT), other
channels have to be used as well.
3.1.2. Existing Modeling Solutions for O&M
The operational model forecast for German coasts is performed by BSH for the circu-
lation part. Operational ocean wave forecasts with 3 days lead time are provided by the
German Weather Service (DWD). The core element of the BSH model system is the 1 km
BSHcmod 3D circulation model for the German coastal water, which is two-way nested into
a coarser North Sea/Baltic Sea model. DWD uses the WAM model in combination with
the atmospheric ICON model. Six-day wave forecasts with about 1.5 km resolution are
available for the North West Shelf area from the European Copernicus system [ 39]. Hereon
is using various model setups for the coastal German waters with a strong emphasis on
research aspects related to the coupling between atmosphere, wave, and ocean circulation.
The standard models used in this context are NEMO, WAM, and the unstructured grid
model SCHISM, which is suitable for analyzing small-scale processes in estuaries and rivers
or around offshore wind farms [ 40]. Strong cooperation exists between Hereon, the Uni-
versity of Hamburg, and the Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI) in the context of
multiscale ocean modeling, e.g., combining the MPI-OM and ICON models with SCHISM.
Offshore wind farms were included in parameterized form in the atmospheric COSMO
model as well as in the ocean circulation model SCHISM, which are both part of the Hereon
GCOAST system [41]. OWFs are, however, not yet included in operational models.
3.2. Protection of Submarine Cables
For protection of submarine cables, the key information product is sediment layer
thickness above the cable. In Part I [ 8], a cost-effective solution for generating this product
was proposed, i.e., through integrated use of survey observations and coupled ocean‚Äìwave‚Äì
sediment modeling tools. Below, we analyze the availability and assess the adequacy of
community observations and modeling capacity for performing the survey-modeling inte-
grated approach for predicting areas with high mobile sediments and burial depth changing
rate. Here, the ‚Äúcommunity observation‚Äù means data measured by public agencies, or
private or citizen data openly available.
In this application, Danish and adjacent waters are used as an example in the analysis.
Danish EEZ is located in both Baltic and North Seas, and is part of Baltic‚ÄìNorth Sea
transition waters. In order to simulate sediment transport in the Danish EEZ, both the
Baltic‚ÄìNorth Sea area and Danish EEZ waters should be resolved, especially high resolution
with 1 km or smaller grid is needed. Input data for a sediment model, including both
bedload and suspended sediment, consist of bathymetry, currents near seabed, waves,
sediment discharges from land, median grain size, bed slope, sediment density, salinity, and
temperature. Among these variables, the most important information is waves, currents,
sediment density and grain size, and bed slope. Sediment layer thickness itself is one of the
model outputs, and observations are needed to validate the model.
3.2.1. Existing Monitoring for Submarine Cable Protection
For all applications, as long as an integrated monitoring-modeling approach is used,
bathymetry and river discharges are the two basic input datasets.
Bathymetry: in European seas, EMODnet Bathymetry provides gridded bathymetry
data with about 115 m resolution. In shallow water, more recent bathymetry was mapped
using data from satellites, e.g., Sentinel 2. DHI-Group offers such data at DHI bathymetry
portal as commercial products with spatial resolution of 10 m and 2 m, as well as an
uncertainty measure that indicates accuracy for each data point. This method can produce
bathymetry in different times using frequently revisited Sentinel 2 (since early 2016).
For Danish waters, data with 50 m resolution or higher in 50 m can be obtained from
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
J. Mar. Sci. Eng. 2023 ,11, 1817 8 of 36
Danish Geodata Styrelsen. In addition, bathymetry can be measured using acoustic devices
operated from ships [42].
Lateral sediment Ô¨Çux to the sea: this includes sediments from the rivers and coastal
erosion. The data are needed as lateral forcing in the sediment models, including both
suspended and bedload components. In [ 43], 79 major rivers were used for the Baltic‚ÄìNorth
Sea region. For the area of the North Sea, the main source of information were the Delft
Hydraulics study Contaminant retention in North Sea estuaries [ 44] and the OSPAR (Oslo
and Paris Conventions) report on Riverine Inputs and Direct Discharges (RID) [ 45]. This
report is regularly updated. The most recent one is published in 2021 [ 46]. The RID database,
which is maintained in the Norwegian Institute for Bioeconomy Research (NIBIO), can be
accessed online. The riverine SPM inputs in Sweden were obtained from [ 47]. SPM inputs
in major rivers from other Baltic Sea countries can be obtained from Global River Water
Quality Archive (GRQA) [48].
Coastal erosion is another source of sediment entering the sea, for example, the
English cliffs of Suffolk, Norfolk, and Holderness. The west coast of Denmark has soft cliffs
consisting of very Ô¨Åne particles such as clays and Ô¨Åne sands. The shoreline in this region
has been retreating at a speed of 0.5‚Äì4 m per year due to coastal erosion during the past
40 years [ 49]. Severe Ô¨Åne sand transport occurs mainly during storms. The sea level rise
and increasing extreme events, e.g., Ô¨Çooding and storm surge, can increase risks of the
nearshore section of the submarine cables and the cable stations [50].
Seabed substrate: in the Baltic‚ÄìNorth Sea, EMODnet Geology provides a seabed
substrate map in a scale of 1:100,000 with an EUNIS category. In Danish waters, GEUS
provides a seabed substrate map in a scale of 1:250,000, with seven substrate categories.
The sediment classiÔ¨Åcation expresses the sediment type of the upper 0.50 m of the seabed.
Each sediment class is deÔ¨Åned based on the speciÔ¨Åc grain size distribution. In addition,
information about sediment distributions can be obtained using acoustic instruments
mounted on ships [51,52]
SPM concentration in the sea: hourly SPM concentration has been measured inten-
sively using, among others, the SmartBuoy, FerryBox, and glider methodologies in the
European seas since 2000 [ 53]. Turbidity data from many mooring buoys can also be
transformed into SPM concentration. Some of those data are available, for example, in the
REPHY database [ 54] for the North Atlantic Shelf Seas. In the Baltic Sea, there are several
research datasets, containing a few hundred samples that cover the western, eastern, and
northern Baltic Sea. In inner Danish waters, SPM concentration has been measured in three
transections. These in situ observations are available from EMODnet Geology and can be
used to validate the satellite and model products. For surface SPM concentration, CMEMS
provides comprehensive satellite products in the Baltic‚ÄìNorth Sea, including an open sea
product in 4 km resolution, an offshore product of 300 m resolution (up to 200 km from
the coast) and a nearshore product of 100 m resolution. However, the SPM products were
only validated using in situ measurements from the REPHY (Observation and Monitoring
Network for Phytoplankton and Hydrology in coastal waters) database.
Sedimentation rate, sediment layer thickness, critical shear stress: observations on
seabed net sedimentation rate and/or sediment layer thickness are required for model
calibration and validation. EMODnet Geology has collected such data, which well cover
the Baltic Sea, the Skagerrak, and the Norwegian Trench. However, there are little data
existing in the Danish EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone) and the open North Sea. In addition,
information on the critical shear stress for moving gravel sediments are rarely available.
These data or information are only available from geological surveys for the industrial
sector or individual research such as in [55].
Waves and currents: In general, current and wave measurements are rarely existing
for European waters, although currents proÔ¨Åles near seabed are especially valuable for
validating sediment transport models. However, such observations are mainly made by
the oil and gas exploration industrial sector.

3.2.2. Existing Modeling Capacities for Submarine Cables
The models required for submarine cable protection are coupled ocean‚Äìwave‚Äìsediment
transport models. Such models are already available, e.g., Coupled Ocean‚ÄìAtmosphere‚Äì
Wave‚ÄìSediment Transport Modeling System (COWAST) [ 56], developed by USGS (United
States Geological Survey). The sediment transport model includes both cohesive and
non-cohesive sediment dynamics [ 57]. Another model is a Ô¨Ånite element coastal ocean‚Äì
wave model SCHISM (Semi-implicit Cross-scale Hydroscience Integrated System Model)‚Äî
WWM (Zhang et al., 2016a,b [ 58,59]). A sediment transport module is also included. The
model system has been applied in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea [ 58,60]. However, these
models have not been applied and validated for submarine cable protection.
In addition, knowledge of critical shear stress and settling velocity of sediments with
different grain sizes are still of high uncertainty in the sediment transport module [ 61].
Observations are needed to improve the parameterizations.
3.3. Wake and Lee Effects
For applications related to the wake and lee effects of OWFs, the key information
product is the impact of OWFs on winds, ocean conditions, waves, and sediment transport.
In Part I [ 8], an integrated monitoring-modeling approach was proposed. The models
required include weather, ocean, wave, and sediment transport models, which can resolve
multiple scales ranging from individual OWF scale to coastal connectivity scale and multi-
farm and cross-border scale. These models will not resolve individual turbines. Instead,
the effects of individual turbines are parameterized according to the models‚Äô grid sizes.
Such parameterizations can be developed using observations or combined with turbine-
resolving very high-resolution computational Ô¨Çuid dynamics (CFD) simulations such as
large eddy simulations (LES). Observations in the farm site and surrounding waters are
required to derive the turbine-effect parameterizations and to calibrate and validate the
CFD and ocean‚Äìwave‚Äìsediment transport models.
3.3.1. Existing Monitoring Solutions for Wake and Lee Effects
Observations to study and assess wake and lee effects are gathered by OWF opera-
tors, research programs, operational monitoring agencies, environmental monitoring, and
coastal agencies. Sea state, sea level, currents, and winds within OWFs are often monitored
exclusively by OWF operators. These data are conÔ¨Ådential and can be used for research
after a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) is signed. Nacelle wind speed and operational
variables are measured by SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) systems
from all turbines, together with wave data from buoys and winds from ground-based
LIDAR data. Research projects may also obtain permission to carry out multi-disciplinary
monitoring activities, including physical, wave, sediment, biogeochemical, and biological
monitoring. For EC-funded projects, research data should be released as soon as possible,
following the FAIR (Ô¨Ånd, access, interoperate, and reuse) principles. In particular, multi-
disciplinary datasets obtained from research projects dedicated to studying the wake and
lee effects will be very useful for deriving and validating parameterizations of turbine and
OWF impacts. One example is the three FINO research platforms, which provide hourly
meteorological and oceanographic observations in German EEZ waters, including wind
proÔ¨Åle data from a mast of 103 m high. Operational and coastal agencies are responsible
for carrying out operational monitoring on, e.g., sea level, waves currents, and winds
in the coastal waters, using Ô¨Åxed platforms of tide gauge stations, moorings and coastal
morphological stations, and FerryBox. Sometimes, these stations are in the outskirts of
OWFs, e.g., MARNET buoys operated by BSH, tide gauge, FerryBox, and HF radar net-
works in European coastal seas, so the observations can be used to quantify the wake and
lee effects and validate the OWF impact-resolving models. Environmental monitoring is
regular low-frequency (4‚Äì24 times a year) sampling in air, seawater, biota, and seabed.
These data can be used for model validation. In Europe, operational and environmental
monitoring observations and part of the research observations have been collected and
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

centrally disseminated by EMODnet. Furthermore, OWF lee effects were analyzed in the
framework of dedicated airborne campaigns [ 62,63]. Airborne data were used as well to
evaluate OWF parameterizations in atmospheric models [64].
Regular observations of atmospheric wakes are provided by satellite synthetic aperture
radar (SAR) data as Ô¨Çown on the European Sentinel-1/2 platforms. Analysis of these data
and derivation of empirical parameters to describe the spatial structure of wakes have
been presented in a number of studies (e.g., [ 65,66]). The measurements have big potential
because of the high spatial resolution (<100 m) and the large coverage (>100 km). The
observations are however limited by relatively poor temporal sampling caused by the
dusk/dawn acquisition cycle with overÔ¨Çights every couple of days. We are not aware of
the use of these data on a routine basis for wake monitoring.
Another standard measurement technique to study wakes in the atmosphere [ 67] is
based on long-range Doppler light detection and ranging (lidar). These ground-based mea-
surements have a smaller spatial but higher temporal resolution than satellite SAR systems.
3.3.2. Existing Modeling Solutions for Wake and Lee Effects
The models for assessing the wake and lee effects can be divided into two categories
according to their grid resolution: OWF-resolving models with a grid size larger than the
turbine foundation but smaller than the OWF coverage and turbine-resolving model with a
grid size smaller than the radius of a turbine foundation. The atmospheric wake effects
have been parameterized (e.g., [ 64,66,68,69]), and implemented in mesoscale numerical
weather prediction (NWP) models. To our knowledge, these parameterizations are not
yet included in operational models for forecast production. Sensitivity experiments of the
OWF-resolving HARMONIE in the Baltic‚ÄìNorth Sea region can reproduce the wake effects
in the atmosphere [ 70]. A study concerning atmospheric OWF wakes for the North Seas
using the COSMO model in combination with the Fitch parameterization was presented
in [71]. Engineering models with simpler parameterizations and less computational costs
are used in industry (e.g., [72]).
The impacts of atmospheric wakes on hydrodynamics and waves have been recently
studied by [ 73,74] using an unstructured grid model SCHISM and by [ 75] using COWAST
coupled atmosphere‚Äìocean‚Äìwave models. However, these models do not include turbine
parameterization in hydrodynamic and wave models. An early analysis of the impacts of
OWFs on sea state was provided in [ 76]. The study concluded that the strongest effects
are associated with the reduced wind forcing. Additional impacts are related to reÔ¨Çection
and diffraction of waves at the foundation structure as well as wave dissipation caused
by friction at the piles. For the effects on hydrodynamics, a parameterization of the
additional mixing and friction due to a turbine structure is developed as an extension of the
k‚Äî"two-equation turbulence closure model [ 77]. A high-resolution Reynolds-averaged
Navier‚ÄìStokes (RANS) model of the local scale is used to calibrate this parameterization.
Unstructured grid ocean models have also been used in turbine-resolving impact modeling
studies [ 78]. For OWF impacts on waves, the turbine can be treated as unresolved obstacles
(UOST), and parameterization on UOST has already been included in popular wave models
such as WAM, WWIII, and WWM [79].
3.4. Transport and Security
OWFs have impacts on observations and logistics on the sea. There are different types
of impacts, which require more research and further observations. Here, we focus on
two of them inÔ¨Çuencing the transport and safety sector in the Baltic Sea. First, while the
research focus has mainly been on the impacts of sea ice on mechanical construction of
OWFs (e.g., [ 80]), the large offshore installations inÔ¨Çuence the environment by changing
the natural motion of ice Ô¨Åelds. This has an impact on wintertime marine transport, as
especially in the Northern Baltic Sea, conditions for winter maritime transport change.
The changes in ice Ô¨Åelds also inÔ¨Çuence marine ecosystem due to the impacts on mixing,
sea‚Äìair exchange, and underwater light conditions. Secondly, marine surveillance is based
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
J. Mar. Sci. Eng. 2023 ,11, 1817 11 of 36
on a coastal radar network, which is strongly impacted by the large OWFs, as the OWFs
create reÔ¨Çections and shadowing of objects [ 81]. This limits the construction of OWF,
especially in the Gulf of Finland, but also in areas in the vicinity of Kaliningrad. The OWFs
also inÔ¨Çuence the functioning of the weather radars and limit both wind and precipitation
observations over the sea areas. The decreased accuracy of observations needed for weather
forecasting increases the potential security risks related to lack of accurate environmental
information. A comprehensive analysis of the situation in the Finnish territorial waters has
been published (in Finnish, with abstract in English) by [82].
In accordance with the oil and gas industry, ship trafÔ¨Åc inside the OWF is regulated and
activities such as Ô¨Åshery is very limited. There are several research projects ongoing aiming
to optimize the multiuse of marine space. The recent evolvement of the political situation
in Europe makes it also necessary to take terroristic activity and the impact of militaristic
actions into account including ship trafÔ¨Åc inside OWFs (e.g., Ô¨Åshery, terrorism, military).
In the following, we concentrate on the Northern Baltic Sea, with a rapidly increasing
number of OWFs in the near future and seasonal ice conditions, which causes additional
challenges for the OWF sector.
3.4.1. Existing Monitoring Solutions for Transport and Security
Currently, there are practically no OWFs in the Northern Baltic Sea [ 8]. However, the
number of planned OWFs is very large and the situation will change rapidly in only a
few year time scale. The existing observing network is an optimized balance between the
current needs and available Ô¨Ånancial resources. The current observing network consists
of a limited number of marine weather stations, mainly manual ice observations, wave
and temperature buoys, few FerryBox lines, and Argo (Array for Real-Time Geostrophic
Oceanography) Ô¨Çoats. These are supported by remote sensing methods utilizing X-band
coastal radars, AIS (automatic identiÔ¨Åcation system) network for ship tracking, weather
radars, satellite remote sensing products, and irregular monitoring cruises. Some additional
data are obtained through other observations, like maritime cameras and hydrophones,
but it is typically not available for public research or forecasting purposes. Additionally,
the current political situation impacts the reliability of AIS data as there are cases both
with falsiÔ¨Åed AIS signals and dark vessels (i.e., AIS transponders turned off). All these
security aspects combined also inÔ¨Çuence the protection of seabed cables (Section 3.2),
whether damaged accidentally (environmental conditions) or intentionally (hostile human
activities). Thus, several overlapping and independent methods are needed [83].
3.4.2. Existing Modeling Solutions for Transport and Security
The ocean models used in the Northern Baltic Sea are developed for a range of
societal needs on transport, security, and environments. These models include an operative
hydrodynamic model with sea ice forecasting capabilities (NEMO-LIM3) and wave models
(WAM, SWAN). The atmospheric modeling, including wind Ô¨Åelds, is carried out with
the Harmonie‚ÄìArome NWP model. These models produce sea state and weather Ô¨Åelds
necessary for environmental analysis and transport sector forecasts. They are also used as
modeling input values for assessing the impacts of OWFs on (radar) electromagnetic signal
propagation over the sea.
Sea ice forecast is an important product for transport and security related to the OWF
industry. In the Baltic Sea, several sea ice models such as LIM, CICE, HELMI, and HBM-ICE
have been developed and coupled with hydrodynamic models to provide an operational
forecast of the sea ice. Assimilation of sea ice concentration observations is now available in
the CMEMS BAL MFC forecasting system [ 84]. In Finland and Sweden, the model forecast
and sea ice charting are combined for providing the ice service for operations in the sea.
In case of collisions of ships or damage of submarine cables, there might be severe leaks
of oil, gas, or chemicals from the vessels. Three-dimensional drift modeling of pollutants
will be needed. The on-demand oil drift models have been operational in most of the Baltic
Sea countries [ 85]. The similar drift models have also been used for search and rescue.
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
J. Mar. Sci. Eng. 2023 ,11, 1817 12 of 36
Oil drift model in pack sea ice has been developed by [ 86], which is very useful for the
Northern Baltic Sea.
3.5. Contamination
There are two main aspects to be considered to evaluate the impact of contaminants
associated with OWF installations. On the one hand, metal and chemical concentrations
need to be monitored and modeled in the vicinity of the emitting sources. On the other hand,
ocean currents need to be observed and/or simulated to assess the regional dispersion of
these contaminants toward the rest of the oceanic basin.
Corrosion protection systems used for OWF turbines might be responsible for the
release of aluminum, cadmium, zinc, and indium into the ocean) [ 87‚Äì91], with potential
toxic effects on marine life. Aluminum, cadmium, and indium are non-essential metals
for marine organisms. When introduced artiÔ¨Åcially in an environment with a relatively
high concentration, aluminum can negatively affect important regulation and respiratory
functions of adult Ô¨Åshes [ 92]. Cadmium is recognized as an environmentally highly toxic
metal that can accumulate in marine Ô¨Çora and fauna, be transmitted through the food
web and eventually affect human bodies [ 93,94]. While zinc is a necessary element for
the functioning of marine organisms, it also represents a risk of toxicity with increased
concentration [ 95]. Once in the ocean, these metals were found to be able to latch onto
Ô¨Çoating plastics, favoring ingestion by marine organisms and insertion into the food
web, thus representing a threat to ecosystems at large [ 96,97]. Organic compounds with
high toxicity, including biosphenol A [ 98], are also part of the substances associated with
corrosion protection measures that may end up in the ocean due to material damage or
weathering processes [ 91]. While the effect of these emissions from corrosion protection
systems is probably relatively low compared to other sources such as rivers, atmospheric
depositions, or fossil fuel industries [ 88], the potential toxic risk for marine organisms
makes it necessary to monitor the presence of these different components in the vicinity of
the wind farms.
Ocean currents then have the capacity to transport these contaminants over large
distances. While they may have a dispersive effect that progressively reduces their con-
centrations as long as they are transported over the basin, currents may also accumulate
them in speciÔ¨Åc locations due to oceanographic or topographic singularities. Knowing
the possible trajectories of these contaminants once released at the OWF sites is crucial to
characterizing the oceanic connectivity, evaluating the impact of these installations over
entire ocean basins, and understanding the path of these substances across administrative
boundaries.
3.5.1. Existing Monitoring Solutions for Contamination
Monitoring the concentration of metals and other contaminants typically requires
taking samples of either water, bottom sediments, or tissues of marine organisms. The
concentration of metals dissolved in seawater can be measured by collecting water samples
and analyzing them after Ô¨Åltering in the laboratory. Since the toxicity may also depend
on water hardness, pH, dissolved organic carbon, and temperature conditions, these
complementary chemical parameters should also be monitored. The analysis of samples of
sediments and tissues can provide additional information on the presence of metals on the
ocean Ô¨Çoor, and the potential impact of bioaccumulation processes in marine organisms.
While sample analysis techniques are available, they remain quite costly and, to the best of
our knowledge, they have not been implemented for operational automated measurements.
Concerning ocean currents, a routine monitoring of large-scale features is performed
by satellite altimeters through the measurement of sea surface height anomalies and
subsequent determination of associated geostrophic currents. However, these observations
suffer from limitations in the coastal zone and only represent spatial scales larger than a
few tens of kilometers. In coastal areas, high-frequency radars (HFRs), installed on the
shore, have the capacity to measure the surface Ô¨Çows with a kilometer-scale resolution and
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
J. Mar. Sci. Eng. 2023 ,11, 1817 13 of 36
a spatial coverage of a few tens of kilometers from the coast [ 99,100]. When covering wind
farms areas, HFR measurements represent an ideal solution to monitor ocean currents and
water pathways in the vicinity of the OWF. Surface drifters may also be deployed in the
area of interest to infer drifting trajectories from the OWF infrastructure, but they might
not necessarily provide robust information since their trajectory strongly depends on the
ocean conditions at the time of the deployment given the high spatio-temporal variability
of ocean currents in the coastal zones.
3.5.2. Existing Modeling Solutions for Contamination
Hydrodynamic modeling provides a tool to represent the evolution of ocean currents
over wide areas and characterize the ocean connectivity at the regional scale. Nowadays,
simulations and predictions of ocean currents are generated operationally with a spatial
resolution close to 1 km in some regions of the world (e.g., https://marine.copernicus.eu/,
accessed on 1 June 2023) [ 101‚Äì104]. The incorporation in the models of the information
provided by routine and multi-platform observations (from satellite, proÔ¨Åling Ô¨Çoats, under-
water gliders, HFR) through data assimilation provides a way to constrain the simulations
to be as close as possible to the observed conditions. Hydrodynamic-wave coupling can
also be implemented to enlarge the range of resolved processes and in particular represent
the wave-induced drift at the ocean surface. Telescopic model nesting then also allows
for reÔ¨Åning the spatial resolution in limited areas of speciÔ¨Åc interest. Sediment transport
modules are also useful to model the sedimentation and resuspension of particles. On top
of this, Lagrangian modeling [ 105] can be applied to calculate trajectories from simulated
currents and explore the spatio-temporal ocean connectivity at the regional scale.
3.6. Ecological Impacts of OWFs
The development of OWFs has impacts on the marine ecological environment [ 89,106].
There are aspects that, in general, can be associated with positive impacts, such as that
renewable energy helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the climate change
effect. In addition, OWF development can contribute to the development of artiÔ¨Åcial reefs
that provide opportunities for benthic organisms to develop a higher diversity than in
unchanged environments. Those areas are also potentially attracting several Ô¨Åsh species,
leading to new environments for development and increased biodiversity (i.e., [ 107]). Those
positive effects are potentially in exchange with the negative effects caused by the develop-
ment of OWFs, where noise and vibration under construction and in the drift phase can
potentially impact marine species such as Ô¨Åsh, mammals, and invertebrates [ 108,109]. In
addition, OWFs can pose a collision risk for birds and bats, especially during migration
or when placed in important feeding or breeding areas (i.e., [ 110]). Furthermore, the in-
stallation of wind turbines and the associated infrastructure (e.g., cables and substations)
can cause physical habitat alteration and loss. For example, the installation of OWF can
disrupt the seabed and benthic ecosystems and have an impact on the behavior of the
marine species via the change in the electromagnetic Ô¨Åelds, which is caused by undersea
cables transmitting electricity from OWFs [ 111,112]. Furthermore, the currents around
monopiles in OWFs increase turbulent mixing, potentially leading to the break-up of strati-
Ô¨Åcation [ 113,114], increased turbidity [ 115], and changes in primary production [6,116,117] .
3.6.1. Existing Monitoring Solutions for Ecological Impacts
Monitoring the ecological impacts of offshore wind farms is crucial to assessing and
mitigating potential effects on marine ecosystems and for model validation. Underwater
acoustic monitoring systems are used to assess the impact of noise generated during
OWF construction and drift on marine organisms following procedures developed and
implemented (i.e., [ 118]). These systems can track and analyze sound levels, underwater
noise propagation, and the behavior of marine species in response to noise. Visual and
radar systems are employed to monitor bird and bat activity around wind farms. These
systems can detect and track the Ô¨Çight paths of birds and bats to assess collision risks.
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
J. Mar. Sci. Eng. 2023 ,11, 1817 14 of 36
Additionally, bird and bat observers may be stationed on vessels or offshore platforms to
conduct real-time monitoring. Video monitoring using underwater cameras and remotely
operated vehicles (ROVs) allows for direct observation of the marine environment around
OWF. These surveys can assess the presence, behavior, and interactions of marine species,
including Ô¨Åsh, marine mammals, and benthic organisms. Satellite imagery and remote
sensing techniques can provide valuable information on changes in sea surface temperature,
total suspended matter and phytoplankton biomass, and the distribution of marine species
at the water surface over larger spatial scales. Observations of vertical proÔ¨Åles of physical
and water quality variables require proÔ¨Åling buoys or proÔ¨Åles observed from ships. Benthic
surveys are conducted to sample and monitor the seabed and associated organisms in the
vicinity of OWF (for example, [ 51]). The conduction of eDNA analysis involves collecting
and analyzing water samples to detect and identify genetic material shed by organisms in
the environment. It can provide information on the presence, abundance, and diversity of
species and potentially provide information on changes in behavior.
3.6.2. Existing Modeling Solutions for Ecological Impacts
The construction and operation of OWFs can have signiÔ¨Åcant impacts on marine
ecosystems and the habitats of marine organisms. Those impacts are mainly caused by
changes in (1) noise, (2) habitat, (3) electromagnetic Ô¨Åelds, and (4) water quality. Spatially
explicit frameworks to analyze the integrated effects of wind farms on the marine environ-
ment aiming to evaluate how wind farms can contribute to the protection of the marine
environment through strategic and economically viable location choices are developed
and applied for quite a long time (i.e., [ 119]). Systematic methods for mapping how in-
creased pressures from human activities may cause cumulative ecological effects on marine
ecosystems are developed [ 120]. Those frameworks aim to provide answers regarding
the integrated effect. A couple of such frameworks are established for speciÔ¨Åc regions. In
the Netherlands, the Deltares model D-FLOW-FM-DCSM is used to evaluate the potential
effects of future OWFs on currents, vertical mixing, suspended sediment concentrations,
phytoplankton dynamics, and benthic Ô¨Ålter-feeders [ 121]. For validation of this model,
vertical proÔ¨Åles of temperature, salinity, suspended matter, and phytoplankton are the
main gaps in required observations for model validation. In the area of water quality
modeling, there is a long tradition of developing models for the human impact on the
marine ecosystem (i.e., [116,122]).
Those integrated frameworks depend crucially on the realistic modeling of the speciÔ¨Åc
impact factors on the ecosystem. In order to be able to calculate the sound level at a given
distance from the source, it is important to have sufÔ¨Åcient knowledge of the parameters
that must be included in such a model [ 123], such as sound source, water depth, bottom
topography, properties of the bottom and water column (density, sound speed, and attenu-
ation). Parameters that are often not sufÔ¨Åciently known. For habitat changes, there exists a
variety of model approaches for the speciÔ¨Åc components of the ecosystem (i.e., Ô¨Åshes: [ 124]).
The modeling of the electromagnetic Ô¨Åeld and changes via the implementation of OWFs is
in a premature state, and many approaches are taken from terrestrial applications. How-
ever, [ 125] have conducted modeling evaluations investigating EMF (electromagnetic Ô¨Åelds)
by subsea power cables. For all types of ecological models, system understanding of the
long-term impacts of OWFs is the main gap for further model development and testing.
We are only starting to observe and understand these impacts as the implementation of
OWFs is under development.
4. Gap Analysis
In the following, gaps are identiÔ¨Åed for all six use cases. The analysis is structured
along different gap categories, e.g., gaps in accessibility and availability of observed vari-
ables, as well as deÔ¨Åciencies in spatial and temporal sampling or in model-observation
integration. It is obvious that this analysis can never be totally objective. It is, however,
a view that is shared among the authors, who come from six European countries and
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

who were involved in various projects with industry and agency involvement. We are
also aware that the assessment of gaps will change over time because of the extremely
dynamic situation in terms of technology developments and the largely unpredictable
political boundary conditions. As the authors are not representing the entire offshore wind
sector, we are not trying to make strong statements regarding priorities, but we rather see
this analysis as a contribution to a broader discussion among industry, agencies, politics,
and research that is necessary on a European level and beyond.
A condensed overview of gaps regarding monitoring and modeling is provided in
Tables 1 and 2 , respectively. We will discuss these deficiencies in more detail in the following.

4.1. Gaps in the Accessibility of Observed Variables
In this section, two types of gaps are addressed. Firstly, gaps in data availability are
discussed, which refer to relevant variables that are currently not observed at all. Secondly,
the problem of data accessibility is analyzed, which refers to the obstacles encountered
when trying to access existing datasets.
The effects of OWFs on the atmosphere and the ocean are strongly conditioned by
processes in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). For example, the ABL stability has
a big impact on the length of atmospheric wakes [ 65]. Currently there are very few
measurements suitable to assess the state of the atmosphere (e.g., proÔ¨Åles of temperature,
wind, and humidity). Furthermore, many of the available measurements, e.g., from FINO-1
are affected by the surrounding wind parks, i.e., they do not provide information on free
stream conditions. For a better understanding and model representation of OWF interaction
with the ocean it is paramount to have more information about Ô¨Çuxes of momentum and
heat in the vicinity of the wind farms.
For the O&M use case, measurements of momentum and heat Ô¨Çuxes near the sea
surface would contribute to optimizations of coupled atmosphere/wave/circulation mod-
els, which are required to provide reliable short-term forecasts of the conditions during
maintenance operations. Furthermore, there is a lack of reliable measurements needed for
predictive maintenance related to corrosion, in particular dissolved oxygen, sulfate, and
pH. Dissolved oxygen and pH are provided by the CMEMS modeling system, but sulfate
is not. Of particular concern with respect to corrosion are the pile segments, which are
periodically wetting and drying due to wave impacts, as well as the structure above, which
is affected by marine aerosols. For both processes, more detailed information on wave
breaking and respective statistics in the vicinity of the wind parks is required.

For contamination assessment, concentrations of most of the contaminations (e.g., Al,
Zn, BBA) in the OWF and surrounding areas have not been monitored. The data are needed
in water samples and in benthic and pelagic bio-samples.
Accessibility to existing data related to offshore wind farm applications can be quite
different according to which type of observations are concerned: operational, environ-
mental, commercial, or research data. For operational data access, CMEMS, INS, TAC,
and EMODnet have collected most of the in situ observations in Europe and made them
freely available to the public. For observations from environmental monitoring, the data
are also freely available via EMODnet, ICES (for the Baltic‚ÄìNorth Sea), SeaDataNet, and
national ocean data centers. However, these data are mainly sampled by research ves-
sels and distributed in a delayed mode. The locations are not chosen to detect changes
in environmental conditions due to OWFs. Some countries, e.g., Norway, Sweden, and
Estonia, have initiated near real-time ship data, especially CTD (conductivity, temperature,
and depth) data delivery. Other countries, such as Germany, Denmark, and Finland, have
their CTD data available in a few weeks, while data from EMODnet chemistry, ICES, and
SeaDataNet can only be available months to a couple of years after the monitoring. For
OWF operational applications, e.g., O&M, near real-time access to the data is required, but
this is mainly for metocean variables with high-frequency observations.
Commercial and research monitoring provides more data on a local scale compared
to operational and environmental monitoring, i.e., within OWFs and surrounding areas.
However, these data are more limited for public access. The data usages are often subjected
to signing NDAs (non-disclosure agreements). In recent years, there have been some efforts
for collecting and disseminating commercial and research observations related to OWFs.
4C Offshore (https://www.4coffshore.com/, accessed on 1 June 2023) provides worldwide
offshore wind farm information with a membership fee. The Crown Estate Marine Data
Exchange (MDE, https://www.marinedataexchange.co.uk/, accessed on 1 June 2023) holds
data from a variety of industries, including marine aggregates, subsea cables, tidal and
wave energy, offshore wind, and also data from research and evidence projects, which have
grown to almost 300 TB of survey data from over 50 offshore projects across the U.K.; over
2600 survey campaigns covering over 15 survey themes, from geophysical data to marine
mammal surveys.
According to the Crown Estate Data policy, regarding environmental data, despite
the contractual position with regard to conÔ¨Ådentiality, in general the Crown Estate will
not release data relating to a particular project, until consent is awarded and the period for
judicial review has passed. Once a Ô¨Årm consent decision has been determined, the data are
effectively in the public domain, so generally will be released thereafter.
For physical survey data including geophysical and geotechnical data, the Crown
Estate will hold survey data relating to geophysical, geotechnical, metocean, and mete-
orological data, conÔ¨Ådentially until a Financial Investment Decision (FID), subject to a
biannual review from the date of consent, where the time period between consent and FID
is extended.
However, not all countries have an organized data collection and release system for
OWF survey data as the Crown Estate in the U.K. Considering that the OWF applications
need survey data and environmental data in OWFs, such data collection and dissemination
mechanism is crucial. OWFs also measure metocean data, e.g., winds and waves in the
farm in near real time. These data are usually held by the OWFs. They may be used for
research purposes if an NDA is signed. For research at the ecosystem scale, observations
from different countries need to be combined. A centralized EC focal point for OWFs
to upload their publishable data or metadata should be available to facilitate OWF data
sharing and exchange.
Offshore meteo-masts have been built up and operated to measure meteorological
and oceanographic observations in the past decade for research purposes. These data have
been well managed at the national level and made available for research. In Germany, three
masts (FINO 1, 2, and 3) have been maintained since 2007, and data access can be made

at https://login.bsh.de/fachverfahren/, accessed on 1 June 2023 after registration. In the
Netherlands, wind@sea (https://www.windopzee.net/en/wind-op-zee/, accessed on 1
June 2023) collects, processes, and makes data available at eight offshore wind farm sites.
In Denmark, DTU has maintained a website http://www.winddata.com for collecting and
disseminating wind data, including 75 datasets at present, mostly from Danish waters.
However, there is no centralized focal point from EC to collect and disseminate research
data in OWFs, especially from EU FP7, Horizon 2020 (H2020), and Horizon Europe (HEU)
projects. For H2020 and HEU programs, projects are mandatory to deliver a Data Manage-
ment Plan (DMP), which, in principle, ensures that a project-oriented data policy based on
FAIR principles is in place. Efforts are needed for centralized data delivery and publication
of these projects.
4.2. Gaps in Spatial Data Sampling
For the six applications analyzed in this study, observations are required at
four different spatial scales: (S1) within OWFs, (S2) between OWFs and the coast, (S3)
cross-OWFs, and (S4) across national borders.
The atmosphere and ocean dynamics around OWFs is characterized by a strong
coupling of these different spatial scales. For example, the presence of the adjacent land
has an impact on the land/sea wind speed gradients [ 126,127]. The length of atmospheric
wakes can extend up to 100 km downstream and the impacts on waves can reach even
farther. The inhomogeneous sampling of atmospheric and oceanic parameters existing at
the moment is not able to provide a complete picture of the 3D dynamics around OWF.
With regard to the O&M use case, the very heterogeneous sampling of wave and
atmospheric boundary layer information is not optimal. As pointed out before, ocean wave
dynamics encompasses a large spectrum of spatial scales with high connectivity, and in
order to optimize wave forecasts, e.g., using data assimilation, a more regular sampling
would be highly beneÔ¨Åcial. This situation will get even more challenging with growing
OWF installations, which can potentially impact waves on all scales (S1‚ÄìS4).
For seabed cable protection, data are mainly needed in S2‚ÄìS4 scales, with a focus
on sections along seabed cables. Observations are mainly managed by energy agencies.
All sediment conditions along the cable lines are monitored regularly. However, this
monitoring can be optimized. With validated models, one can predict the sediment layer
thickness above the cable, identify the areas with high risk, and optimize the sampling
strategy. This may reduce the cost of monitoring largely. For validating models, a suitable
research database on bathymetry, currents, waves, sediment types and concentrations,
sedimentation, and erosion rates in the cable area is needed. In the sediment survey along
the cable lines, if possible, the integrated measurements for these variables should also
be made.
For assessing and predicting wake and lee effects, observations of wind, currents,
turbulence in the sea, and ABL, waves, and sediment concentration are needed in all
four scales, especially in the wakes. At the current stage, the main priority is to Ô¨Åll the
knowledge gaps on the impacts and develop high-quality weather‚Äìocean‚Äìwave‚Äìsediment
models, which can predict the wake and lee effects. Currently, there is a lack of dedicated
observations in the S1 scale in wake areas. Existing data have a limited number of stations
in a farm and often close to the turbine. This is not suitable for wake study. There is also
a lack of proÔ¨Åles of water temperature, salinity, and currents in the wakes. Danish and
German waters can be a suitable testbed for the wake and lee effect study, as there is an op-
erational monitoring network combined with HF radar, ADCP (Acoustic Doppler ProÔ¨Åler),
moorings, tide gauge stations, and FerryBox, which can complement the commercial and
research datasets.
For transport and security applications in icing waters, operational observations, espe-
cially waves and sea ice (concentration, edge, type, drift, and thickness) data, are needed.
It is still not clear how the turbines may affect ice formation and drifting, considering
enhanced turbulence in the wakes. The interaction between ice and waves is also an
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
J. Mar. Sci. Eng. 2023 ,11, 1817 24 of 36
important process for correctly predicting the sea ice and waves. To Ô¨Åll the knowledge
gaps, dedicated in situ measurements of sea ice and waves in offshore wind farms are
required for model calibration and deÔ¨Ånition. The in situ sea ice thickness is also important
to quantify and reduce the uncertainties of the satellite observations. Currently, in situ sea
ice and wave measurements in icing waters in the Northern Baltic Sea are quite sparse.
For the assessment of ecological impacts, the main gaps in spatial data availability
are observations of vertical proÔ¨Åles of physical and biochemical variables and consistent
data over the whole gradient where ecological impacts can occur. This covers at least the
wind farm itself, including the monopiles and the area in between (S1), as well as the wake,
which often exceeds national borders (S2‚ÄìS4).
For most of the considered use cases, there is a lack of simultaneous observations
inside (S1) and outside (S2‚ÄìS4) of offshore wind parks, e.g.:
 To assess and forecast the conditions for O&M-based observations in free stream
conditions outside the areas inÔ¨Çuenced by wind farms;
 To assess sea surface properties (waves, SST, ice) marine boundary layer parameters,
which are relevant for radar signal propagation in the transport and security context;
 Sea ice observations required for model validation and data assimilation are missing;
 Some observations, e.g., from weather and military radars, are compromised by
offshore wind farms, and this needs to be compensated by other observations;
 To assess the ecological impacts of no-Ô¨Åshing zones in the wind farm areas;
 To assess local and regional environmental impacts of anti-corrosion measures, e.g.,
sacriÔ¨Åcial anodes [91];
 To assess wake effects inside of OWFs as well as larger-scale effects associated with
neighboring OWFs, including those in neighboring countries (S4).
For some of the application areas, there is also a deÔ¨Åcit concerning the simultaneous
observation of coastal gradients and observations inside of the wind farms, e.g.,:
 To relate potential chemical contamination by anti-corrosion measures to contamina-
tion by rivers;
 To improve the understanding of the interaction between coastal wind speed gradients
and atmospheric wakes.
For larger-scale effects, e.g., long atmospheric wakes, transports of contaminants,
or the connectivity of habitats, harmonized datasets across European countries (S4) are
still lacking. As discussed in the previous section, this is related to ongoing challenges
concerning regulations and interactions between industry, agencies, and research.
4.3. Gaps in Temporal Availability
There are three major time scales of relevance for the discussed use case: T1 (opera-
tional time scale of a few days), T2 (installation lifetimes of about 25 years), and T3 (climate
change time scales of 30 years and beyond).
Ideally, OWF impact studies should make use of observations taken before the instal-
lations were built, in the operation phase, as well as after decommissioning or repowering
(T2‚ÄìT3). The reality is that for most OWF sites, consistent observations of this kind do not
exist. It is recommended to start observations three years prior to the start of the OWF
installation. What is urgently needed is to deÔ¨Åne respective monitoring strategies for the
OWF installations, which are planned for the future. In addition, there is no consistent
strategy for long-term monitoring, e.g., to track the ecological impacts and impacts of
climate change on offshore wind energy (T3).
In O&M application, we focus on two activities: platform dismantling assessment and
operational maintenance. The former needs mainly long-term (T3), high-frequency wave
data in S1, while the latter needs near real-time (T1) metocean data, especially winds and
waves, mainly in S1 but also S2‚ÄìS4 areas. Currently, most of the European OWFs have
their own wind and wave conditions monitored operationally with an update frequency
of 10 min or 1 h in the S1 scale. For areas of S2‚ÄìS4, since no maintenance operations
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
J. Mar. Sci. Eng. 2023 ,11, 1817 25 of 36
will be carried out, a combination of operational monitoring (in situ and satellite) and
model prediction can meet most of the requirements. Furthermore, for the O&M use case
the availability of near real-time data with short latency is critical for the optimization of
short-term forecasts. Such access does, in fact, exist for many observations, e.g., from the
MARNET stations operated by BSH. The lack of consistent information about observation
accuracy is still an ongoing issue, however.
For ecological impact assessment applications, long-term biogeochemical, habitat, and
biodiversity data are required (T2‚ÄìT3). The sampling needs to be made before and after the
installation of the OWFs. The focus should be Ô¨Årst put on the OWF and surrounding area
in order to enable OWF siting in an area causing minimal impact, then in the area of S2‚ÄìS4.
Existing observations for this purpose are made during surveys for impact assessment of
OWFs and research projects. Long-term, sustainable observations for ecological impact
assessment are still lacking.
In general, one can say that a strategy is missing to develop a balance between long-
term, consistent measurements and more Ô¨Çexible monitoring activities, which can become
necessary to look at unexpected environmental impacts, improve process understanding,
or validate on-demand modeling systems.
Another challenge that still exists is a mismatch between spatial and temporal sam-
pling. An extreme example is satellite radar measurements, which provide very high
spatial resolution and coverage, but the temporal sampling is not sufÔ¨Åcient to capture the
dynamics of the observed processes. On the other hand, observations from Ô¨Åxed platforms
provide sufÔ¨Åcient temporal sampling, but the coverage is often so poor that processes like
advection related to spatial gradients are not resolved at all.
4.4. Gaps in Observation/Model Integration
When an integrated modeling-monitoring approach is applied for information provi-
sion, the basic idea is that the monitoring should provide quality-assured observations to
Ô¨Åt for the purpose of improving model quality while models, on the other hand, can be
used to optimize the sampling strategy and improve the cost efÔ¨Åciency of the monitoring
activities. The applications in this study can be divided into four categories: (i) operational
service (O&M, transport and security), (ii) regular or long-term assessment (cable protec-
tion, contaminants, ecological impacts), (iii) applications with signiÔ¨Åcant knowledge gaps
(e.g., cable protection, wake and lee effects), and (iv) on-demand and what-if service (e.g.,
O&M, cable protection, transport and security, contamination). The requirements and gaps
can be quite different among the four categories. For the operational services, a major
concern is the timeliness and quality of the forecasts for, e.g., winds, waves, and currents.
Major gaps for this category of applications are:
1. Observations used for data assimilation in operational forecast systems start to get
affected by OWFs, and this is not yet taken into account in the modeling systems;
2. There is a lack of strategy about the use of observations taken by the wind farm
operators, e.g., in data assimilation schemes;
3. There is a lack of suitable observations for model validation and parameter tuning;
4. Machine learning (ML) and artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence (AI) tools should be developed to im-
prove the local forecast by integrating local OWF observations and forecasts; long-term
local observations are therefore valuable for training and optimizing the algorithms.
For long-term assessments, regular and long-term information products are needed;
thus, model-observation integration should serve this purpose. Major gaps in this area are:
1. There is a lack of strategy concerning long- and short-term measurements, e.g., re-
quired for improved process understanding and respective model representation,
model parameter optimization, or operational data assimilation;
2. There is a lack of information about realistic pan-European future OWF installa-
tion scenarios that can be used for optimization of monitoring systems using OSSE
approaches, as well as model scenario calculations.

For applications with knowledge gaps, the model-observation integration should
serve the purpose of adding new knowledge, including calibrating and optimizing relevant
model parameterizations. Major gaps in this area are:
1. There is a lack of observations in the targeted areas, such as along cable lines or
in wake and lee areas, which are needed for optimizing OWF parameterizations in
the models;
2. To understand processes such as sediment erosion in the seabed and wake and lee
effects, integrated observations are needed. Targeted sampling strategies should be
designed to Ô¨Åll the knowledge gaps and improve model parameterizations.
For the applications that need on-demand and/or what-if scenario service, e.g., in case
of collision, search and rescue, and pollution, on-demand modeling tools and observations
are required. Major gaps in this area are:
1. Existing on-demand modeling systems, e.g., oil spill, search and rescue systems,
should be dedicated to the OWF industry and, therefore, be able to integrate local
observations;
2. The integrated model-observation system should be developed to supply extra in-
formation based on simulations of what-if scenarios when a critical environmental
condition is likely to be reached and a decision on the operations has to be made.
In addition, it is essential to have information on observation accuracies, which is
particularly critical for applications in the O&M context, where decisions with large Ô¨Å-
nancial implications have to be taken based on monitoring and modeling information.
In the wake and lee effect studies, since the mean impacts of OWFs on the winds and
waves are just a few percent, accurate data on winds and waves are thus very important
to calibrate and validate the models. For wind power forecasts, the required accuracy
for wind speed information is 3% due to the cubic dependence of wind power on wind
speed [ 128]). Currently, there is a signiÔ¨Åcant gap both in the availability as well as the
standardization of such information. Activities to improve this situation do exist (e.g., [ 34])
and should be extended signiÔ¨Åcantly.
Concerning the O&M use case, the integration of observations and numerical models
is still not well developed. One of the challenges is the very short time scale of wave
dynamics and the domination of sea state errors by inaccuracies in the driving wind Ô¨Åelds.
This means that the observed errors have to be traced back in order to realize efÔ¨Åcient data
assimilation schemes. Furthermore, some of the errors are caused by the forcing of the
model at the open boundaries, and respective corrections are not trivial. Observations
near these boundaries would add much value to the data assimilation schemes. It appears
that the combination of classical data assimilation schemes and machine learning (ML)
approaches or pure ML techniques [ 129] has the potential to address these problems, and
more research is required in this Ô¨Åeld. For the training of ML methods, quality control and
consistency of large observation datasets become even more important.
5. Discussion and Recommendations
In the previous section, gaps were identiÔ¨Åed in observation systems as well as in the
integration of measurements with numerical models. The analysis was structured along dif-
ferent OWF use cases and along different observation characteristics, e.g., spatial sampling .
It seems obvious that the evolution of the existing monitoring systems was driven
by a number of use cases, which had high priority in the past. For example, tide gauges
were necessary for the development of storm surge forecast systems. Likewise, wave
buoys have been important components in coastal management system, e.g., in the context
of coastal erosion, for a long time. More sophisticated measurements, e.g., acquired by
ADCPs, have become necessary to validate 3D circulation models, which are key elements
in drift forecasts.
There is a general trend in the modeling community toward stronger coupling of
different physical, biological, and chemical model compartments, which is necessary
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
J. Mar. Sci. Eng. 2023 ,11, 1817 27 of 36
to capture interaction processes of practical importance, e.g., the Stokes contribution of
waves to the currents. As explained before, coupled models are an absolute necessity
to capture processes in the vicinity of offshore wind farms and to provide respective
information products. These coupled modeling systems have increased complexity in
terms of dynamics and numerical implementation, i.e., model validation has become an
even more challenging task, with broader requirements concerning observation systems. In
particular, the validation of Ô¨Çuxes (e.g., energy, momentum, substances) between different
model compartments is of growing importance for the new generation of coupled modeling
systems. Many of the observation gaps identiÔ¨Åed in the previous section are related to
missing information about the connectivity of different processes in the ocean and the
atmosphere. This is a major bottleneck for the further optimizations of modeling systems
and Ô¨Åt-for-purpose information products.
Due to the increased computational capacity available today, there is also a trend to
Ô¨Åner spatial model resolutions. Unstructured grid models, which allow grid cells of only a
few meters in size near the coast, have almost become a standard. As the typical spacing
between offshore wind turbines is about 1km or below, it is obvious that model simulations
for the offshore wind sector require Ô¨Åne spatial grids to resolve interactions between
offshore wind farms and the environment. The validation of high-resolution models leads
to new challenges for observation systems as well. Either one has to make sure that the
sensor matches the resolution of the model, or one has to apply appropriate statistical
methods for the validation. A careful characterization of the measurement process, e.g.,
spatial and temporal integration windows, is of increasing importance to make models and
observations comparable. Likewise, reliable information about systematic and stochastic
observation errors is essential for the assessment and optimization of models.
The formulation of recommendations for the evolution of monitoring systems in the
context of offshore wind farming is complicated by the fact that various actors in this
sector have to be considered. In addition, there is a larger spectrum of instruments that
are on the table to drive certain developments. In the following, we will focus on the
following pathways:
 Optimization of regulations and policies concerning data acquisitions and sharing,
obligatory data sharing;
 Incentives for monitoring technology developments;
 IdentiÔ¨Åcation of synergies with other user groups of observation data;
 Additional observations and modeling to Ô¨Åll the observing gaps due to OWF radar
shadowing effects and changes in sea surface properties;
 Implementation of a dynamic trans-European platform for information exchange and
identiÔ¨Åcation of changing requirements;
 Platform for communication between industry, agencies, and researchers;
 Complementary research, in particular concerning model/observation integration to-
ward the development of a digital twin for the two-way coupled system of technology
and environment.
With regard to data sharing, regulations should be put in place that make sure that
offshore wind farm operators do not have a competitive disadvantage by opening access to
their observations. We think that a combination of three strategies should be applied:
 Regulations should be implemented to make sure that standard observations are
made public by all wind farm operators. Starting with the opening of the historical
datasets would already be a step in the right direction. The approach used in the U.K.
can be used as a Ô¨Årst guideline;
 It should be more transparent how the different actors in the offshore wind sector
can beneÔ¨Åt from data sharing. In this context, research should better quantify the
potential improvements in forecasts on different spatial and temporal scales;
 Regulations should be adjusted to allow cross-border measurement campaigns, e.g.,
with aircraft, ocean gliders, AUV , or drones. These systems can often operate au-
tonomously, which leads to additional regulation requirements.
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
J. Mar. Sci. Eng. 2023 ,11, 1817 28 of 36
It is important to note that some OWF operators have already started to publish
their observations for non-commercial use, e.g., √òrsted, and this development should be
further encouraged.
With regard to incentives for technological developments, we see a number of areas
with much potential:
 Drone technologies, whether in the air (AAV), at the sea surface (ASV), or underwater
(AUV), are seen as very Ô¨Çexible tools both in the technological (e.g., blade inspections)
and also in the earth system context (e.g., measurements in the atmospheric boundary
layer/sea surface/underwater). In particular, developments toward a full automati-
zation of this technology could lead to a step change with regard to monitoring in the
offshore wind sector. Apart from the technological challenges, this will also require
adjustments on the regulative side and in legislation;
 There are many promising applications of machine learning techniques in the offshore
wind sector, e.g., in the context of corrosion modeling. These approaches rely on big,
consistent, and quality-controlled observation datasets. There should be more joint
efforts of industry and research to produce such datasets with open access.
Concerning synergies with other user communities, we see much added value in the
following strategies:
 The offshore wind community should team up with the operational weather and
forecast community. Operational observations are already affected by OWFs, and
these have to be included in parameterized form in operational models. This, in
particular, requires information about the operational status of OWFs;
 It becomes increasingly important to assess cumulative environmental impacts origi-
nating from different technologies. We, therefore, see many beneÔ¨Åts in the design of
combined monitoring strategies, including sectors like shipping, Ô¨Åshing, oil and gas,
and industry discharging into rivers. There are also obvious synergies with military
monitoring programs that could be exploited more;
 Offshore wind farm sites are areas with a relatively high density of observations and
are therefore interesting candidates as test and validation sites for satellite systems.
This would also provide the opportunity to optimize satellite observing systems for
offshore wind applications.
For the security and transport use case, the following issues should be addressed:
 The potential need for additional weather radars to compensate for shadowing effects,
joint planning with neighboring countries;
 Additional surveillance radars in OWFs shadow-speciÔ¨Åc areas;
 Additional sea ice observations (thickness, forces) are needed, especially in the begin-
ning, to study the impacts of OWFs on sea ice;
 Additional vertical wind measurements; precipitation on marine weather stations;
new marine weather stations;
 Wind turbines act as wind sensors: the data can be used to Ô¨Åll the measurement gaps
due to the shadowing effects;
 Implementation of OWF-module to HARMONIE METCOOP NWP [ 69,130] and other
regional high-resolution NWP models;
 Small-scale ice model development;
 Improved OWF parameterizations for radar signal propagation models.
With regard to a trans-European information platform, it is recommended that:
 The platform should contain consistent and updated information about the status
and concrete future plans concerning OWF installations in Europe. This information
should be sufÔ¨Åcient to allow the integration of these installations into operational
models and model scenario calculations;
 The platform should contain information in the form of datasets or interactive infor-
mation systems, which allow wind farm operators and agencies to learn from the
experiences, e.g., concerning environmental impacts in other regions;
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
J. Mar. Sci. Eng. 2023 ,11, 1817 29 of 36
 The platform should contain observation datasets, which are suitable for studying
environmental conditions before and after offshore wind parks were built;
 The platform should deÔ¨Åne and contain observation datasets, which are suitable for
long-term analysis of climate change impacts on the offshore wind sector;
 The platform should provide information about best practices for quality control of
observation data and the deÔ¨Ånition as well as estimation of observation accuracies;
 The platform should provide best practice information on optimized OWF siting (i.e.,
siting with a minimal environmental impact and best coexistence with other industries ).
With regard to a platform for communication between industry, agencies, and re-
searchers, we see much potential in the following strategies:
 There should be a platform with continuity for the communication between industry,
agencies, and researchers, which goes beyond the typical three-year cycle of national
and European research projects. We think that this will help to build trust between
these groups, and it will contribute to longer-term strategic planning, e.g., of scientiÔ¨Åc
measurement activities;
 There has to be a continuous update and exchange of information about industry
requirements, legislative frameworks, and new research developments.
With regard to complementary research and modeling activities, we have the following
recommendations:
 The approach of on-demand modeling is seen as a very efÔ¨Åcient tool to react quickly
and in a Ô¨Çexible way to emerging new challenges, e.g., unexpected environmen-
tal impacts. This requires a respective modeling infrastructure and model interface
harmonization;
 More dedicated observations should be gathered to optimize and validate coupled
modeling systems, which are essential to capture the two-way interaction between
the installations and the environment. Particular deÔ¨Åcits exist in the atmospheric
boundary layer and for ecosystems;
 OWFs have to be included in operational weather and ocean forecast models. Ne-
glecting these installations will not only disregard the environmental effects of the
OWFs, but also compromise the use of operational observations, which are impacted
by the turbines. Data from OWFs would also help in Ô¨Ålling the observing gaps due to
radar shadowing effects;
 Integration of cross-border modeling and observation systems should be implemented
to study and assess the impacts of OWFs on neighboring countries. This is also
important to develop respective legislative frameworks related to, e.g., environmental
impacts and ecosystems;
 The development of OWFs is currently going much faster than the development of
observations, modeling, and understanding of their ecological impacts. This bears
the risk that we only understand their ecological impacts after it is too late to reduce
the number of OWFs in our coastal waters. By sharing data and experiences from
existing OWFs, we can speed up the development of understanding, which would
allow some time for adaptive management.
As a Ô¨Ånal comment one should say that the ‚Äústatic‚Äù view of a classical gap analysis as
depicted in Figure 1 is to some extent oversimplifying the situation in the offshore wind
energy sector. This is because of (1) the lack of process understanding, (2) fast technological
developments, and (3) unpredictable dynamics in economic market developments and
politics. This means that the design of monitoring systems for this sector should have
considerable Ô¨Çexibility to allow for later adjustments concerning commercial focus areas
and research priorities.
6. Summary and Conclusions
A gap analysis was presented for observation systems and respective integrations with
numerical models in the context of Ô¨Åt-for-purpose information products required in the
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

offshore wind energy sector. The study is the second part of two papers, with the Ô¨Årst one
concentrating on the identiÔ¨Åcation of requirements for six use cases. It was explained that
gap analysis is a powerful tool to optimize decision processes by enforcing the development
of clear ideas about target scenarios and the transparent assessment of the initial situation.
The study also discussed the challenges of applying this tool in the context of offshore
wind energy. One key challenge is the balancing of economic and environmental target
deÔ¨Ånitions because this includes discussions about values and ethical aspects that require a
broader discussion in society, i.e., this is not a purely scientiÔ¨Åc issue.
The study provided an overview of the monitoring and modeling solutions that are
presently used to provide information products for the offshore wind community. It be-
came quite clear that the observation and model systems used today have evolved due to
requirements associated with a number of standard applications, e.g., storm surge forecasts
or wave predictions for shipping. It also appeared that the monitoring of ecosystem param-
eters is less mature than respective systems for the measurement of physical quantities.
By comparing the present situation with the requirements identiÔ¨Åed in [ 8], gaps were
identiÔ¨Åed, which were structured along different categories, e.g., spatial and temporal
sampling or data availability and accessibility. Many of the identiÔ¨Åed gaps have to do with
the fact that the existing monitoring systems are not adequate to capture characteristic
length scales of today‚Äôs offshore wind farms, e.g., related to the spacing of turbines. This
means that different types of wake effects and turbine impacts on the environment cannot
be assessed appropriately with the available observations. In addition, OWFs create new
types of physical, chemical, and biological processes, which are not captured by the present
monitoring systems at all, e.g., the generation of turbulence by turbine structures in the
water and the atmosphere. Furthermore, it was discussed that most of the Ô¨Åt-for-purpose
information products for the offshore energy sector have to include various types of
connectivity aspects, e.g., the continuum of land, wind farm, and open ocean spatial scales.
Likewise, the treatment of most optimization problems occurring in offshore windfarming
requires detailed knowledge about interaction processes between different earth system
compartments, e.g., the atmosphere, the ocean, the sea Ô¨Çoor, and the ecosystem. There is
still a lack of suitable measurements for this purpose, although information about these
coupling mechanisms is also highly relevant in other contexts, e.g., climate change. There
are also still observations missing to identify, understand, and predict two-way interactions
between the technology and the environment. This has become increasingly challenging
because of the rapid development of OWF installations in terms of turbine size and OWF
coverage. It was also found that with regard to temporal sampling, a measurement strategy
is missing to assess the environmental conditions before and after windfarms were installed.
The issue is of growing urgency since locations not impacted by OWFs are increasingly
hard to Ô¨Ånd.
Finally, a number of recommendations to Ô¨Åll the gaps were formulated. These include
different technological aspects, e.g., autonomous systems like drones, but also sugges-
tions concerning data policies and cooperations between science and industry. Due to
the large-scale interactions of OWFs with the environment and also among each other,
the development of measurement strategies across country borders was identiÔ¨Åed as an
essential step forward. It is foreseeable that this step will also be of vital importance for
a further synchronization and optimization of the energy system on a larger scale, e.g.,
across Europe. Another important recommendation concerns the exploitation of synergies
by identifying common interests and requirements in different communities and sectors,
e.g., the OWF community and operational forecast centers.
Finally, it is important to emphasize that this study is meant as a contribution to a
discussion, which needs to be continued and extended. The task at hand is challenging
not only because of the complexity and the rapid evolution of technology but also because
of the diversity of the different communities that have to be brought together to Ô¨Ånd
suitable solutions for the future. The experience in the past has shown that the respective
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

communication and synchronization processes take time and that makes a structured and
transparent approach even more important.
