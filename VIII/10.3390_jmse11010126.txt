Abstract: This initial publication is part of a series of publications that will appear soon, which
pursue a Ô¨Ånal objective for the proposal of a fully integrated and controlled hybrid system composed
of a Ô¨Çoating wind turbine‚Äîtype ‚ÄúOC3-Hywind‚Äù‚Äîand two marine current turbines with the aim
of increasing the energy generated by the Ô¨Çoating installation and, at the same time, use the set
of turbines as actuators as part of an integral cooperative control system of the Ô¨Çoating hybrid
system to ensure the structural stability of the Ô¨Çoating hybrid generator system (FHGS) in harsh
weather conditions, which is a key issue in this type of Ô¨Çoating systems. A specially designed tool to
design, analyze, and control this type of FHGSs was developed using Matlab¬Æ. In this tool, named
Floating Hybrid Generator Systems Simulator (FHYGSYS), several tests were carried out on the
structural stability of the system considering the interactive phase of the acting forces. Working in a
programming environment like Matlab¬Æallows design freedom and the possibility of evaluating the
system with different geometries, aerodynamic airfoils, and external meteorological conditions, and
also including or eliminating certain elements, etc. This versatility will be helpful in future studies
aimed at evaluating this system and maximizing the production of energy.

1. Introduction
Wind energy extraction techniques have evolved from the Ô¨Årst wind turbines installed
on land, allowing the increase in their size with the objective of generating more electricity.
At the same time, the idea of using the potential energy from the sea to produce electricity
is being consolidated in recent years. Additionally, different energy generation systems
are currently under development to achieve the capacity of extracting energy from waves,
tides, or marine currents [1,2].
Floating wind turbines (FWT) [ 3,4] are the alternative to offshore wind power genera-
tion for depths greater than 60 m. Operating at a distance from coasts involves using more
important wind resources and reducing the visual and noise impact. Nevertheless, the
Ô¨Çoating nature of these devices involves stability requirements to account for the control
system further than the power production.
The Ô¨Årst prototype [ 5], Blue H, was installed in 2008 in a water depth of 113 m. Since
then, researchers and Ô¨Årms have commissioned other prototypes.
WindÔ¨Çoat¬Æis a patented FWT developed by Principle Power Inc [ 6]. The Windplus
consortium used this wind turbine (WT) to design the Ô¨Årst Ô¨Çoating wind farm in offshore
Portugal [ 7]. The Ô¨Årst turbine was installed in 2010, and, in July 2020, the Ô¨Çoating wind
farm was fully operational. WindFloat Atlantic is grid-connected to Portugal, generating
up to 25 MW.

RWE Global is also working on FWT prototypes [ 8]. DemoSATH is a 2 MW turbine
over a concrete structure [ 9]. The prototype has a single point of mooring that provides
self-alignment to the current and wave direction. This project is installed on the north coast
of Spain. TetraSpar is a 3.6 MW turbine over a tubular steel structure [ 10]. The prototype
test site is located in Denmark, 10 km offshore with a depth of 200 m. Aqua Ventus is an
11 MW WT over a concrete semi-submersible structure [ 11]. This project is expected to be
operative in 2024 in New England (USA).
A disrupting FWT system is being developed by X1wind [ 12]. This Ô¨Årm developed
PivotBuoy¬Æ[13], a system capable of self-orientating the Ô¨Çoating turbine to maximize the
generated power, thus reducing the weights, making FWT more competitive.
Real prototypes and scientiÔ¨Åc research [ 14,15] show that the control of FWTs faces
challenges that cannot be overcome with conventional power control techniques. High
structural loads or platform movement due to wave currents and tidal forces impose
stability restrictions not considered in traditional WT control. This vital requirement
has pointed to the need for advanced predictive control and condition monitoring tech-
niques to preserve structural stability and integrity, as opposed to conventional power
control techniques.
In a conventional wind turbine with structural support to the ground, the angular
displacement of the tower is relatively small, even under challenging wind conditions.
The axial force of the wind mainly causes bending moments in the tower. Under these
conditions, the weight of the nacelle acts by compressing the tower, not bending it.
The dynamics of large horizontal axis wind turbines‚Äîwith structural support to the
ground‚Äîcan be modeled using a Ô¨Åve-degree-of-freedom model. The dominant
modes [16] include:
 out-of-plane deÔ¨Çection of the blade Ô¨Çap rotor;
 in-plane deÔ¨Çection of the blade edge;
 fore-and-aft tower motions;
 powertrain roll and twist.
As suggested in Figure 1, the dynamics of the deformations associated with these
degrees of freedom tend to be coupled.

Figure 1. Bending of a wind turbine . 
For example, the tower fore‚Äìaft motion is strongly coupled to the blade flap motion, 
and the tower roll motion is strongly coupled to the blade edge and power train torsion.  
In this context, large mode rn WTs allow the application of control techniques that 
make possible an independent adjustment of the pitch angles of each blade [17]. Individ-
ual pitch control extends the conventional objectives of pitch control to reducing fatigue 
loads, particularly by  active damping tower oscillations.  
In the case of complex floating systems with six degrees of freedom, the system be-
haves as a mass‚Äìspring‚Äìdamper  system affected by changing forces resulting from wind

and hydrodynamic forces due to waves and marine currents. Under certain conditions of
higher-than-normal wind speed, conventional pitch control techniques introduce negative
damping in the movement of the Ô¨Çoating tower. That causes an excitation of the natural
frequency and may cause the Ô¨Çoating structure to resonate by applying decreases in
the wind opposition when varying the pitch angle of the blades to regulate the active
power generated. This phenomenon was observed in tests carried out at the Ocean Basin
Laboratory at Marintek in Trondheim [18].
In an FWT, the support platform moves freely, and the tower can experience angular
displacements of several degrees. In this case, the weight of the nacelle is directly related
to the bending of the tower. Of note in this phenomenon are the effects of its amplitude
and frequency. In terms of frequency, due to constantly varying wind and wave loads,
signiÔ¨Åcant fatigue stresses occur in the structure.
These considerations lead to the subjection of special operating conditions worthy of a
detailed analysis, which can only be performed with the help of simulation software tools.
SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the simulation tool FAST [19] is to be highlighted for this purpose.
Additionally, to perform such an analysis, it is necessary to have a coupled dynamic
behavior model of the Ô¨Çoating support base and the tower/nacelle. This model will help
us to deÔ¨Åne which variables should be monitored in the context of a condition monitoring
system of the FWT structural system.
Attention must be paid to the interactions between the mechanical effects due to
inertia loads (rotor, nacelle, and tower) and the electrical effects (generator, control, and
protection systems).
The controller‚Äôs goal should be to minimize turbine and platform motion while limit-
ing mechanical wear on the generator and transmission. In this sense, some simulation tools,
such as FAST [ 20], have system linearization tools that can be used to design controllers
based on the linear-quadratic gain theory. Another option is the design of controllers based
on the Lyapunov theory for the minimization of energy functions. The FAST simulation
tool was speciÔ¨Åcally developed to carry out pre-study tests on the overloads that can occur,
among others, on the blades and tower of the Ô¨Çoating wind turbines. It allows the testing
of different control strategies, such as Gain Scheduling PID, LQR with Collective Blade
Pitch, and LQR with Individual Blade Pitch or H ¬•.
Studies were initially conducted with individual target controllers for rotor speed
regulation using collective blade pitch [ 21] for different FWT systems [ 22]. In the last
ten years, individual pitch control has been the main trend in this area [ 23]. In [ 24], an
individual pitch control scheme was developed to deal with blade and pitch actuator faults
in FWTs. It is shown that, with these faults, conventional pitch control techniques fail.
Modern techniques [ 25] (such as sliding control) have also been applied to pitch control in
an FWT, with promising results. The proposed controllers can accomplish better power
regulation, reducing the platform pitch motion and the blade load.
From the point of view of control engineering, hybrid FWT and marine current turbines
(MCT) foundations are promising generators that can achieve more excellent stability than
FWT. These foundations are a hot topic in the research and study of control algorithms and
marine power generation. A series of objectives is raised that aim to develop advanced
control, monitoring, and diagnostic algorithms for the maximum use of marine generation
systems to increase the performance and structural stability of the system and ensure its
economic viability.
The traditional objective of control systems applied to hybrid generation systems has
been to maximize the energy generated. In the case of generation systems resting on a
Ô¨Çoating offshore platform, other requirements, such as structural stability, may be equally
or more important. Due to the difÔ¨Åculty of access, costly maintenance, and expensive
commissioning involved in having generators offshore, ensuring the physical integrity of
the generator is the priority.
The hybridization offers an opportunity to address the problem of controlling the
structural stability of the Ô¨Çoating system. Stability enhancement has been considered a

major challenge since the early days of Ô¨Çoating wind turbine design. With this objective, in
this work, a speciÔ¨Åc solution is exposed, consisting of a Ô¨Çoating hybrid system composed
of a wind generation subsystem and a generation subsystem with two marine current
turbines. This proposal allows the development of an integrated control system which
simultaneously deals with the structural stability of the system and the optimization of the
generation capacity.
A hybrid system capable of taking advantage of both wind energy and marine currents
to produce electricity with the aim of maximizing the performance of a structure installed
in the sea was designed in [ 26‚Äì30]. In [ 26], the Ô¨Årst version of this type of hybrid system
called HYWIKIM was presented. In [ 27], the Ô¨Årst behavioral hypotheses of HYWIKIM
were exposed. In [ 28], a real HYWIKIM prototype was presented, which was tested at the
Real Club N √°utico de Valencia. In [ 29], the results of the tests carried out with HYWIKIM
were extended and presented. In [ 30], the Ô¨Årst version of the mathematical model that
allows the simulation of the behavior of this hybrid system concept was presented, using an
‚ÄúOC3-Hywind‚Äù-type Ô¨Çoating wind turbine described in [ 31], to which two marine current
turbines were coupled, as those described in [32].
The novelty of this proposal is that it introduces the concept of cooperative, integrated
control of the two generation subsystems involved to counteract tendencies towards in-
stability, which, if not avoided, reduce the useful life of the hybrid system. This issue
is highlighted as especially important in [ 33]. This is an inherent problem with hybrid
Ô¨Çoating systems where, under certain circumstances, the applied pitch control can cause
the Ô¨Çoating system to resonate.
In order to effectively use tidal turbines together with wind turbines, the wind and
current resources must coexist. In some cases, one‚Äîor both‚Äîof the natural resources can
threaten the Ô¨Çoating system‚Äôs stability. There are many places worldwide‚Äîgenerally in
the straits‚Äîwhere wind resources [ 34] coexist with tidal currents capable of activating
tidal turbines: wind speed above 10 m/s and tidal currents above 2 m/s. Examples
of these kinds of locations (Table 1) are the Banks Strait in Australia [ 35], the Strait of
Gibraltar in Spain [ 36], the Straits in Florida in the United States [ 37], the Strait of Malacca
in Malaysia [ 38], the Dover Strait in England [ 39], the Euripus Straits in Greece [ 40], the
Strait of Messina in Italy [ 41], the Cook Strait in New Zealand [ 42], the Alas Strait in
Indonesia [ 43], The Bosporus Strait in Turkey [ 44], the tidal strait near Roosevelt Island
in United States [ 45], or the Ushant Island [ 46,47]. The current speed depth ranges from
25 to 40 m. Therefore, turbines must be placed at the correct depth in each case to take
advantage of these currents. In the case of low-speed locations, a mechanical augmentation
channel [27] can be used to achieve the proper speed.

Although the design of the Ô¨Çoating hybrid system was made by placing the marine
current turbines at a depth of 20 m, the simulator can be adapted to carry out simulations

by placing the marine current turbines at different depths, depending on the characteristics
of the simulation site.
Continuing with the work carried out in [ 26‚Äì30], the authors plan to publish a series
of articles that broaden the research in this Ô¨Åeld. It is intended to expose, in an exhaustive
way, the mathematical modeling of the Ô¨Çoating hybrid system carried out, dividing the
exhibition into two publications‚Äîthis being the Ô¨Årst of them. Using this model, the study of
the behavior of the hybrid system will be addressed by applying different control strategies.
The series of works will be closed with a Ô¨Ånal installment in which the hybrid system will
be evaluated by changing the characteristics of the elements that compose it: length and
number of blades of marine turbines, different aerodynamic proÔ¨Åles, different number of
mooring lines, etc.
In this work, the Ô¨Årst version of the FHYGSYS tool is introduced using the one-
dimensional theory to compute the thrust of the turbines. This theory allows the obtainment
of a good approximation to know which behavior the steady state response system will
have. The operational capacity of the tool was validated by comparing the results with the
certiÔ¨Åcated test of the OC3-Hywind calculated in FAST 8. This comparison is offered in
Appendix E.
Why did we choose to develop our own tool like FHYGSYS? Mainly because, when the
research line began, there was no simulation tool that would clearly allow the simulation
of marine current turbines, offering the possibility of freely designing different control
strategies. The main objective of the research is precisely that: to study the behavior of a
hybrid Ô¨Çoating system like the one described using different automatic control strategies.
On the other hand, this research has allowed the development of a deep understanding
of the mechanics of this type of complex system. In addition, the developed modeling
techniques can be applied not only to Ô¨Çoating systems, but also to any mechanical system.
This offers a relatively easy path for the macroscopic modeling of mechanical systems, for
example, for modeling systems in automatic control engineering.
This paper is structured as follows: Sections 2.1 and 2.2 introduce the initial assump-
tions for the development of the tool. Section 2.3 exposes the mathematical model, showing
the methodology followed for both kinematic and dynamics calculations. Next, Section 2.4,
describes the forces that were considered relevant for the development of the mathematical
model, but leaving their exhaustive explanation to the second part of this publication.
Section 3 explains the results obtained in the performed tests. Finally, Section 4 presents
the discussion and future work for this line of research.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Floating System
There are different solutions to the problems involved in installing wind turbines
in the sea‚Äîsome of them are compared in [ 48]. The solution chosen in this work is the
one used in phase IV in the ‚ÄúOC3‚Äù project [ 31,49]. There are multiple studies about this
solution, and thus, it can be considered a standard that allows us to easily compare the
results obtained. This conÔ¨Åguration is called ‚ÄúOC3-Hywind‚Äù [ 31,49] and is composed of a
5MW wind turbine [ 50] mounted on a spar-buoy Ô¨Çoating platform [ 31]. It has a mooring
system consisting of three lines anchored to the seabed [ 31,51], which prevents the Ô¨Çoating
system from drifting.
Continuing with the work carried out in [ 26‚Äì30], a mathematical model of a hybrid
system capable of taking advantage of both wind energy and marine currents to produce
electricity is developed (Figure 2).

2.2. Modeling Hypothesis
For the realization of the mathematical model of the system, several modeling hy-
potheses were considered.
The mathematical model does not consider the Ô¨Çexible behavior of the structural
elements from the system. Therefore, the mechanical analysis is carried out considering a
structure composed of a set of rigid solids that cannot deform. This permits the location of
their position just by placing a point belonging to the system in the Euclidean space. In
principle, this simpliÔ¨Åcation does not represent a considerable error related to the movement
of the Ô¨Çoating platform [ 49] and implies that the internal behavior of the different bodies
from the Ô¨Çoating system is ignored.

The Ô¨Çoating system is moored to the seabed through three Ô¨Çexible lines. Their charac-
teristics are found in [31,51].
The geometric depiction of the model is conducted using orthogonal systems of
Cartesian coordinates. Two coordinate systems were mainly considered: a Ô¨Åxed inertial
one (X, Y, Z) and a mobile one (x, y, z) that move together with the rigid solids from the
Ô¨Çoating system. Unless otherwise indicated, when reference is made to speciÔ¨Åc coordinates
in this work, they will always refer to the inertial coordinate system (X, Y, Z) [ 51]. In the
initial position, the origin of the two-coordinate systems match, only separating when some
external force acts on the Ô¨Çoating structure.
To represent the position of the Ô¨Çoating system, six degrees of freedom were used
(Figure 4), with three translations‚Äîsurge, sway, and heave‚Äîand three rotations on each of
the axes of the coordinate system‚Äîroll, pitch, yaw [31,51].

 2.2. Modeling Hypothesis  
For the realization of the mathematical model of the system, several modeling hy-
potheses were  considered.  
The mathematical model does not consider the flexible behavior of the structural el-
ements from the system. Therefore, the mechanical analysis is carried out considering a 
structure composed of a set of rigid solids that cannot deform. This permits the loca tion 
of their position just by placing a point belonging to the system in the Euclidean space. In 
principle, this simplification does not represent a considerable error related to the move-
ment of the floating platform [49] and implies that the internal beh avior of the different 
bodies from the floating system is ignored . 
The floating system is moored to the seabed through three flexible lines. Their char-
acteristics are found in [31,51].  
The geometric depiction of the model is conducted using orthogonal syst ems of Car-
tesian coordinates. Two coordinate systems were  mainly considered: a fixed inertial one 
(X, Y, Z) and a mobile one (x, y, z) that move together with the rigid solids from the float-
ing system. Unless otherwise indicated, when reference is made to specific coordinates in 
this work, they will always refer to the inertial coordinate system (X, Y, Z) [51]. In the 
initial position, the origin of the two -coordinate systems match, only separating when 
some external force acts on the floating structure.  
To represent the position of the floating system, six degrees of freedom were used 
(Figure 4 ), with three translations ‚Äîsurge, sway , and heave‚Äîand three rotations on each 
of the axes of the coordinate system ‚Äîroll, pitch, yaw [31,51].  
 
Figure 4. Degrees of freedom of the floating system (initial position).  
The position of the inertial coordinate system (X, Y, Z) is as follows [51]: the X ‚ÄìY 
plane is located at sea level, the Z axis is on the tower, and the floating platform axis of 
symmetry ‚Äîwhen fo und in its initial position ‚Äîin the opposite direction to the accelera-
tion of gravity, as shown in Figure 4.  
At each instant of time, the next position of the mobile coordinate system (x, y, z) is 
calculated as a function of the accelerations produced by th e forces acting on the floating 
system. From each new position of the mobile coordinate system, the position of the rest 
of the elements is also obtained. In [51 ], the process of calculating the position of the moor-
ing system and the rigid solids that cons titute the floating structure is similar to the one 
described above.

The position of the inertial coordinate system (X, Y, Z) is as follows [ 51]: the X‚ÄìY
plane is located at sea level, the Z axis is on the tower, and the Ô¨Çoating platform axis of
symmetry‚Äîwhen found in its initial position‚Äîin the opposite direction to the acceleration
of gravity, as shown in Figure 4.
At each instant of time, the next position of the mobile coordinate system (x, y, z) is
calculated as a function of the accelerations produced by the forces acting on the Ô¨Çoating
system. From each new position of the mobile coordinate system, the position of the rest
of the elements is also obtained. In [ 51], the process of calculating the position of the
mooring system and the rigid solids that constitute the Ô¨Çoating structure is similar to the
one described above.
It is assumed that the classical hydrodynamic problem can be linearly modeled [ 51].
This assumption allows us, in the Ô¨Årst place, to simplify the mathematical model of the
incident waves, which is not adequate when the sea is in extreme conditions [ 51]. Secondly,
it splits the hydrodynamic issue into three simple problems [ 51]: radiation, diffraction, and
hydrostatic problem. Finally, it allows the application of the superposition theorem.
Although it is considered that the system consists of a set of rigid solids, some of these
can rotate with respect to the rest. This is the case of the wind turbine and the nacelle,
which can rotate to be aligned with the direction of the main wind or that of the support
and marine turbines, which can turn to be oriented with the incident current.
2.3. Mathematical Model
The hybrid system is mainly composed of four structural elements: a Ô¨Çoating plat-
form, a tower, a nacelle, and support for current turbines (Figure 2). The system is also
equipped with one wind turbine consisting of three blades, two marine current turbines
(with two blades each), and a mooring system.
Figure 4 shows the Ô¨Çoating system in its initial position. The positions with respect to
the inertial coordinate system of the points of the elements that are part of the system are
mostly extracted from [31,32,50].
The dynamic features (mass, center of mass, moments, and products of inertia) of each
element of the system were obtained using Solid Works¬Æ, representing each of the elements
from the geometry and the dynamic characteristics that were extracted from [ 31,32,50]. All
these inertial data are found in Appendix A.
This is an important piece of information for the simulation of the behavior of any me-
chanical system; in this case, it will allow the modiÔ¨Åcation of the mechanical characteristics
of any of the bodies of the Ô¨Çoating system, thus obtaining simulations in future works.
The mathematical model of the hybrid system is an adaptation of the approach used in
robotics for the development of the mathematical model of an industrial robot arm [ 53]. Fol-
lowing this approach, the mathematical model may be divided in two fundamental parts:
 Kinematics allows us to place in the orthogonal space all the points of the solids from
the Ô¨Çoating system without considering the forces that act on it. From the initial
position of the mobile coordinate system (x, y, z), the position of the other points of
the Ô¨Çoating system is calculated at each instance of time.
 Dynamics processes all the forces that act on the hybrid system and calculates them
at the origin of the mobile coordinate system, which allows us to obtain the resultant
forces and moments that act on this point [ 54‚Äì56]. From these data, the new linear
and angular accelerations can be, respectively, calculated [ 57‚Äì59], which enables us to
obtain the new position for the six degrees of freedom of the system.
The relationship between kinematics and dynamics is shown in Figure 5. The dynamics
is calculated from the inertial data and the external forces acting on the Ô¨Çoating system.
The mathematical models of kinematics and dynamics are explained in this paper in
Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.4 respectively. The inertial data of the Ô¨Çoating system appears in
Appendix A and its processing is explained in Section 2.3.2. A brief but complete exposition
of the forces acting on the Ô¨Çoating system is shown in Section 2.4, while an exhaustive
explanation of these will be presented in the second part of this paper.

2.3.1. Kinematics  
According to [53], there are different methods to represent positions and rotations, 
and the homogeneous transformation matrices stand out among them, which represent 
the position and the rotation together, entailing a reduced computational cost. The use o f 
homogeneous transformation matrices implies the representation of positions in homoge-
neous coordinates. To represent the rotations, roll, pitch, and yaw angles were  used ; this 
set of rotations is more suitable when modeling ships or boats instead of usin g, for exam-
ple, Euler angles [53,60,61].  
To obtain the position of the floating system, the kinematic model obtains in each 
instant of time a homogeneous matrix : MHT(t), which represents the necessary rotations 
and/or translations to place a point from its  initial position to the one that occupies at each 
moment. This Matrix (1) is generally composed of three rotations and three translations, 
also represented by means of homogeneous transformation matrices. As the matrix prod-
uct is not commutative, the orde r of operations must be considered, pre -multiplying the 
matrices that represent each action.

The position  (in meters ) and rotation  (in radians ) of the mobile coordinate system 
within the inertial system is represented by a vector qi, where i represents each of the de-
grees of freedom of the floating system (1 = surge, 2 = sway, 3 = heave, 4 = roll, 5 = pitch, 6

In the mathematical model, Equation (2) is used to rotate the points of the wi nd and 
marine current turbines, to rotate the blades by the precone angle, and to rotate the nacelle -
hub-blade assembly of the wind turbine. It was also used in [30] to position the floating 
system, so the global center of mass was chosen as the center of rotation of the mobile sys-
tem.

2.3.1. Kinematics
According to [ 53], there are different methods to represent positions and rotations,
and the homogeneous transformation matrices stand out among them, which represent

To obtain the position of the Ô¨Çoating system, the kinematic model obtains in each
instant of time a homogeneous matrix: MHT(t), which represents the necessary rotations
and/or translations to place a point from its initial position to the one that occupies at each
moment. This Matrix (1) is generally composed of three rotations and three translations,
also represented by means of homogeneous transformation matrices. As the matrix product
is not commutative, the order of operations must be considered, pre-multiplying the
matrices that represent each action.

The position (in meters) and rotation (in radians) of the mobile coordinate system
within the inertial system is represented by a vector qi, where irepresents each of the
degrees of freedom of the Ô¨Çoating system (1 = surge, 2 = sway, 3 = heave, 4 = roll, 5 = pitch,
6 = yaw). The mobile coordinate system is represented by the word body for brevity‚Äî
because it is attached to the body of the Ô¨Çoating system‚Äîand for consistency with the
representation adopted in [61].
In Equation (1), the order of actions to perform is from right to left. Thus, if the center
of rotation is the same for all three rotations, the translation matrices of Equation (1) will
be written as in Equation (2), where CoR kare the coordinates at the initial position of the
corresponding center of rotation.

Ô¨Çoating system, so the global center of mass was chosen as the center of rotation of the
mobile system.
In this work, the origin of the mobile coordinate center (Figure 4) was chosen as the
center of rotation, to compare the results more adequately in the model validation process
with those obtained with FAST [ 51,62]. This choice allows us to simplify Equation (1)
because, in its initial position, the origin of the mobile coordinate system coincides with the
origin of the inertial coordinate system, which converts the translation matrices of CoR into
identity matrices. So, when Simplifying Equation (1) to position the Ô¨Çoating system at each
instant of time, Equation (3) is used instead.

From Matrix (4), the position, in the inertial coordinate system, of the points of the
Ô¨Çoating system at each instance of time can be obtained Equation (5). This operation applies
to all the points at all time steps, which implies a relatively high computational cost. To
facilitate computation time, instead of multiplying each point separately in Equation (5),
the largest number of points is put together in a 4 nmatrix‚Äîwhere nis the number of
points‚Äîand then Equation (5) is applied.

2.3.2. Inertial Data Processing
One of the reasons for designing this mathematical model is to be able to modify, add,
or reduce any of the single bodies that make up the Ô¨Çoating system. Each single body
has inertial characteristics, such as mass, center of mass, and moments and products of
inertia, all of which deÔ¨Åne its mechanical behavior [ 54‚Äì59]. This means that, to obtain the
global inertial characteristics of the Ô¨Çoating system, a method must be available to unify
the individual inertial characteristics of each single body.
To apply the dynamics equations‚Äîthis will be explained in the following sections‚Äîthe
inertial characteristics of the floating system must be expressed at the origin of the mobile
coordinate system. Starting with the mass, as it is a scalar quantity, the total mass of the
floating system ( mFS) is the sum of the masses ( mi) of each of the nsingle bodies Equation (6).
mFS=n
√•
i=1mi (6)
From the masses ( mi) and centers of mass ( CoM i) of each of the nsingle bodies and
the total mass of the Ô¨Çoating system ( mFS), the center of mass ( CoM ) of the Ô¨Çoating system
is obtained Equation (7), [ 54‚Äì56]. This calculation is conducted by expressing the points
in the mobile coordinate system, so the resulting center of mass is expressed in the same

system. Each instance of time, the mathematical model obtains the new center of mass,
which changes due to the rotation of the turbines of the Ô¨Çoating system.

The processing of the moments ( Ixx, Iyy, Izz ) and products ( Ixy, Iyz, Izx ) of inertia is
conducted by expressing these as an inertia tensor matrix ( MIT): Equation (8) [ 57‚Äì59]. The
inertia tensor data for each single body ( Iij (SB) ) that make up the Ô¨Çoating system appear in
Appendices A.1‚ÄìA.8 of Appendix A.

To express the inertia tensor of a single body at the origin of the mobile coordinate
system, two simple actions are applied: Ô¨Årst, rotate the inertia tensor to align it with the
mobile coordinate system, and second, move the inertia tensor from its initial position
to the origin of the mobile coordinate system. Obviously, if the inertia tensor is initially
aligned with the mobile coordinate system, it is only necessary to translate it.
1. Rotation about the center of mass of the inertia tensor.
Considering the single body located in its Ô¨Ånal position with respect to the mobile
coordinate system and having the inertia tensor obtained with respect to a speciÔ¨Åc point
of the single body‚Äîusually the center of mass‚Äîand aligned with a coordinate system
attached to the single body. To align the inertia tensor, all the rotations made by the body
must be undone until reaching its deÔ¨Ånitive position.
These rotations can be undone one at a time by choosing the corresponding equation
from Equations (9)‚Äì(11), depending on whether the rotation is about the X,Y, orZaxis.
This operation yields three unit vectors ( ui,vi, and wi) rotated by an angle opposite to that
between single body and mobile coordinate system.

From the inertia tensor Matrix (8) and the three unit vectors obtained through
Equations (9)‚Äì(11), applying Equation (12), the new inertia tensor ( MIT (ROT) ) aligned
with the mobile coordinate system is calculated: Equation (13). Equation (12) was deduced
from the equations used to transform known moments and products of inertia about one
coordinate system into others relative to a second coordinate system that has the same
origin but is tilted relative to the Ô¨Årst coordinate system [ 57‚Äì59]. Equation (12) is a compact
matrix version of the equations used in [30] for the rotation of inertia tensors.

All of this process was validated by comparing the results with those obtained from
the creation of different solids with Solid Works¬Æ, rotated at different angles with respect
to a given coordinate system.
Although the exposed methodology has been explained for the case of a single rotation,
this method allows the composition of several rotations in the same calculation, simply
by multiplying the matrices with the desired rotations successively. This increases the
computation speed of the simulation. Appendix B shows an example in which successive
rotations of the inertia tensor of a single body were made until it was aligned with the
mobile coordinate system.
2. Translation of the inertia tensor from one point to another.
The translation of the inertial tensor of a single body from its center of mass to the
origin of the mobile coordinate system is a simpler process; this is achieved by applying
the parallel axes theorem or Steiner‚Äôs theorem [54‚Äì59].
From the center of mass of the single body (initial point) and the origin of the mo-
bile coordinate system (Ô¨Ånal point), the position vector of the inertia tensor is obtained:

With the position vector calculated in Equation (14) and the inertia tensor known, applying

The moments and products of inertia included in Equation (8)‚Äì(18) depend on time, the
notation ( Iii(t), I ij(t)) has not been included in the expressions for clarity. The variation with
time given in these values is very small and can even be neglected without appreciating
signiÔ¨Åcant changes in the behavior of the Ô¨Çoating system.
2.3.3. Added Mass Processing
A body moving in a Ô¨Çuid behaves as if it has more mass than it really does [ 64]. The
processing of the added mass allows this effect to be considered. According to [ 65], the
added mass can be interpreted as a particular volume of Ô¨Çuid particles that are accelerated
with the body.
The calculation of the added mass depends only on the body shape and the density of
the Ô¨Çuid [ 64]; this implies that the added mass depends on the area of the Ô¨Çoating system
that is submerged at each instant of time. For this reason, the calculation process starts by
deducting the submerged volume of the Ô¨Çoating system Equation (19). The single body
that will be partially submerged is the Ô¨Çoating platform‚Äîthe inertial characteristics of the
body and the volume that is submerged when the Ô¨Çoating platform is in the initial position
appear in Appendix A.1. The support of the marine current turbines and their hubs and
blades are totally submerged‚Äîin Appendices A.6‚ÄìA.8 the inertial characteristics of the
bodies and their submerged volumes are shown.

√•
i=1Vi(t) (19)
mSUM (t) =VSUM (t)rSEA WATER (20)
The calculation of Equation (19) is made by dividing the Ô¨Çoating platform into
three regions : a lower cylindrical zone with a diameter of 9.4 m and an upper one, also
cylindrical with a diameter of 6.5 m, these zones are joined by a linearly tapered conical
region‚Äîin [ 49], all these features are described at greater length. The calculation of the
submerged volume of the Ô¨Çoating platform is conducted in a simple way by obtaining the
volume of the solids in these three regions. When the platform is tilted, the volume of the
upper cylinder is obtained by considering the volume of a truncated cylinder.
The calculation of the volume Equation (19) is completed by adding the volume of the
Ô¨Çoating platform to the volume of the support for the marine current turbines, their hubs,
and their blades.
Using Equation (20), the mass of the submerged volume is obtained by multiplying it
by the density of seawater‚Äî1025 kg/m3.

To calculate the added mass, it is necessary to know the position of the center of
buoyancy of the Ô¨Çoating system Equation (21). This is the center of gravity [ 66] of the
submerged volume explained in previous paragraphs found at each instant of time. The
calculation is performed in a similar way to the calculation of the center of mass of the
Ô¨Çoating system Equation (7).

The volumes ( Vi(t)) that appear in Equation (21) correspond to the volume of the
lower cylinder, the upper cylinder, and the conical region of the Ô¨Çoating platform, as well as
the volumes of the support of the marine current turbines, their hubs, and their blades. The
centers of buoyancy ( CoB i) correspond to those of mentioned volumes‚Äîwhen the platform
is tilted, the center of buoyancy of the upper cylinder of the Ô¨Çoating platform is obtained
by considering the center of buoyancy of a truncated cylinder.
In addition to the volume and center of buoyancy of the zones indicated in the previous
paragraph, for the processing of the added mass, it is necessary to know the resulting inertia
tensor of all these zones expressed at the origin of the mobile coordinate system.
The inertia tensor of the Ô¨Çoating platform is obtained‚Äîin the same way that it was
conducted for the calculation of the volume and the center of buoyancy‚Äîby dividing the
Ô¨Çoating platform into the same three regions: lower cylinder, upper cylinder, and conical
region. The calculation of the moments and products of inertia of these zones are obtained
in a simple way, since they are very common solids [54‚Äì59].
The inertia tensors of the submerged volumes of the support of the marine current
turbines, their hubs and their blades are indicated in Appendices A and A.6‚ÄìA.8.
Once the inertia tensors of all the submerged volumes are known, the necessary
rotation and translation operations are carried out‚Äîin a similar way to that explained in
Section 2.3.2. Equations (8)‚Äì(17)‚Äîto Ô¨Ånally obtain the inertia tensor expressed at the origin

Knowing that the added mass must be interpreted as a particular volume of Ô¨Çuid
particles that are accelerated with the body [ 65], the movement of this volume of particles
depends on the shape of the body [ 64]. For this reason, the values of the submerged
mass Equation (20) and the inertia tensor Equation (22) cannot be used directly without
considering the shape of the body.
This consideration is complicated to carry out for the real shape of the submerged
volume of a body; in [ 61,64], the process for calculating the constants called added mass
derivatives is exposed.
In this work, we chose to carry out a simpliÔ¨Åcation that allows us to process the added
mass with a negligible error and a low computational cost. This simpliÔ¨Åcation was made
by resembling the submerged volume of the Ô¨Çoating system‚Äîto calculate the constants
that describe the shape of the body‚Äîto that of an ellipsoid as shown in Figure 6.

Knowing that the added mass must be interpreted as a particular volume of fluid 
particles that are accelerated with the body [65], the movement of this volume of particles 
depends on the shape of the body [64]. For this reason, the values of the submerged mass 
Equation (20) and the inertia tensor Equation (22) cannot be used directly without consid-
ering the shape of the body.  
This consideration is complicated to carry out for the real shape of the submerged 
volume of a body ; in [61,64 ], the process for calc ulating the constants called added mass 
derivatives is exposed.  
In this work, we chose  to carry out a simplification that allows us to process the 
added mass with a negligible error and a low computational cost. This simplification was 
made by resembling t he submerged volume of the floating system ‚Äîto calculate the con-
stants that describe the shape of the body ‚Äîto that of an ellipsoid as shown in Figure 6.

The values of the semi-axes of the ellipsoid chosen are the following: aand bwere
assigned the value of the radius of the lower cylinder of the Ô¨Çoating platform (4.7 m) and c

spheroid‚Äîwhen a=band c>a‚Äîare exposed. In these equations appears the mass and
moments of inertia of the ellipsoid multiplied by a factor that considers the shape of the
ellipsoid. The calculation of these factors is made from three parameters, a0,b0and g0
Equations (24) and (25), which depend on the values of the semi-axes of the ellipsoid. The
parameters a0,b0andg0are obtained from the eccentricity of the meridian elliptical section

In the same way, with Equations (29)‚Äì(31) the moments of inertia of the submerged

Equations (29)‚Äì(31) are based on those indicated in [ 64] for an ellipsoid but substituting

The mass and moments and products of inertia appearing in Equations (22) and (32)
are time dependent, the notation in the expressions has not been included for clarity.
In relation to the simpliÔ¨Åcations made by resembling the shape of the submerged
volume to that of an ellipsoid, the behavior of the Ô¨Çoating system was compared with
numerous simulations performed under the same conditions using the FAST software,
obtaining a high coincidence. The result of this validation is offered in Appendix E.
2.3.4. Dynamics
The calculation of the dynamics corresponds to the one explained in [ 61], which is
based on the application of Newton‚Äôs second law to a Ô¨Çoating system. First, the acceleration
vector Equation (33) is calculated from the rigid body matrix, the added mass matrix and the
resulting vector of forces acting on the Ô¨Çoating system expressed in the mobile coordinate
system [ 61]. The resultant vector of forces is a vector of six components, three forces , and
three moments taken about the X,Y, and Zaxes of the mobile coordinate system. So,
the acceleration vector is another vector also with six components, three linear and three
angular accelerations expressed in the mobile coordinate system.

Equation (33) is not considered correct expressed in this way, since Newton‚Äôs second
law is only valid when applied to inertial systems [ 68]. To validate Equation (33), the fact
that the resultant of the forces has been expressed in a non-inertial system, such as the
mobile coordinate system, must be compensated for.
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
J. Mar. Sci. Eng. 2023 ,11, 126 17 of 64
The compensation is performed by calculating the value of the acceleration vector
expressed in the inertial system from the acceleration expressed in the mobile system
Equation (34) [61].

Through Equations (35) and (36) the linear velocity transformation matrix and the
angular velocity transformation matrix are obtained, respectively [ 61]. These matrices
consider the successive rotations of the linear and angular components of the acceleration
vector between the mobile and inertial coordinate systems. The derivatives of these matri-
ces also appear in Equation (34), these are obtained‚Äîelement by element‚Äîapplying the
numerical differentiation method of Richardson‚Äôs extrapolation [ 69]. The equations used to
apply this method are shown in Appendix C.1.

Integrating the acceleration vector expressed in the inertial coordinate system, the
velocity vector expressed in the same system is obtained Equation (37). Integrating again,
the vector with the new position of the Ô¨Çoating system is obtained Equation (38). The
integrals are performed by applying the numerical integration method of the Romberg
algorithm [69]. The equations used to apply this method are explained in Appendix C.2.

The velocity vector expressed in the mobile coordinate system is calculated by applying
Equation (39) [ 61]; these data are needed for the calculation of Equation (34) and also allows
us to obtain the kinetic energy that reaches the Ô¨Çoating system Equation (40) and the added
mass Equation (41) [61].

The processing of the kinematics, the inertial data, the added mass, the dynamics,
and the external forces is completed for each instant of time, being related as shown in
Figure 5. The total time to be simulated is divided into time increments, performing the
processing described in each of these time instants. This value must be small enough so
that errors made both in the numerical differentiation and in the numerical integration can
be considered negligible [ 69]. The chosen value with which acceptable results and a low
computational cost are obtained is 0.1 s.

2.4. InÔ¨Çuential Forces on the Floating Hybrid System
The simulation of the behavior of the Ô¨Çoating system focuses on solving the problem
of aero-hydro dynamics coupling [ 70]. Obtaining the resulting forces acting on the Ô¨Çoating
system is based on the fact that those forces do not change too much at each instant of time.
This assumption implies that the accelerations obtained from these forces must not vary
signiÔ¨Åcantly in the same period. If this assumption is given, it will be possible to apply the
superposition theorem [ 51], calculating each of the force vectors separately, adding them
vectorially to obtain the resulting force vector.
The calculation of the different forces acting on the Ô¨Çoating system is generally easier
if it is conducted by expressing the force vector in the mobile coordinate system. Obtaining
the resultant of forces in this coordinate system and processing the dynamics as indicated
in the previous section, adequate results are reached [ 61]. In this work, this procedure was
adopted for simplicity and coherence with the methodology explained in [61].

The calculation of the forces acting on the Ô¨Çoating system can be summarized in
two actions: Ô¨Årst, obtain the vector of forces and the point of application of the force and
second, calculate the force and the equivalent moment at the origin of the mobile coordinate
system. Once all the forces are expressed at this point, the resultant vector Equation (42) is
calculated, which is used in Equation (33) to calculate the acceleration vector and with it
complete the processing of dynamics. The detailed explanation of the calculation of each of
these forces will be presented in the second part of this paper.
The resultant vector of forces Equation (42) is obtained from the forces caused by the
wind turbine, gravity, hydrodynamics, the mooring system, and Coriolis acceleration.
The vector of gravitational forces is calculated by applying Newton‚Äôs law to the
Ô¨Çoating system, using the total mass of it ( mFS) calculated with Equation (6) and the gravity
acceleration (Table 2). Taking the center of mass of the Ô¨Çoating system ( CoM ) obtained with
Equation (7) as the point of application of the force, the moment vector of the force [ 54‚Äì56]
expressed at the origin of the mobile coordinate system is found.

Taking the fairlead of each line ( pFi) as the point of application of the force (Table 3 shows
these values for the initial position of the Ô¨Çoating system), the moment vector of the force
expressed at the origin of the mobile coordinate system is found.

The vector of Coriolis forces is calculated from the velocity vector obtained with
Equation (39), applying the criteria explained in [61].
The force vector of wind turbine is obtained from the thrust generated by the turbine;
this is calculated by applying the one-dimensional theory [72,73].
Taking the center of mass of the turbine ( CoM WTurbine (t)) as the point of application
of the force (this is obtained by applying Equation (7) from the centers of mass of the
hub (Table A7) and of the three blades of the wind turbine (Table A8)‚Äîboth tables can be

The vector of hydrostatic forces is calculated by applying the Archimedes‚Äô principle to
the submerged volume of the Ô¨Çoating system, using its total mass ( mSUM) calculated with
Equation (20) and the gravity acceleration (Table 2). Taking the center of buoyancy of the
Ô¨Çoating system ( CoB) obtained with Equation (21) as the point of application of the force,
the moment vector of the force expressed at the origin of the mobile coordinate system
is found.
The vector of forces of the additional damping is calculated from the velocity vector
obtained with Equation (37), applying the additional damping matrix described in [31].
The vector of forces of the hydrodynamic added mass is included in Equation (33),
through the added mass matrix ( MAM). If it is desired to obtain the value of the vector of
forces and moments to analyze their behavior, they can be calculated as indicated in [ 61,64].
All the simulations represented in this work do not include the effect of the waves, so
the vector of forces of the waves will be explained in the second part of this paper.
The viscous drag force vector is calculated along the entire Ô¨Çoating system, that is,
along the tower and the Ô¨Çoating platform. To do this, the inÔ¨Çuence of the wind on the tower
and the near and sub-surface current on the Ô¨Çoating platform are calculated Equation (45).

To obtain the vector of viscous drag forces, the wind speed along the tower and the

the equations described in [74].
Obtaining the speed of the Ô¨Çoating system at the same points in which the speeds
indicated in the previous paragraph are calculated, and applying the equations described
in [75], the vector of viscous drag forces is obtained. Taking each of these points as the
points of application of the force, the moment vector of the force expressed at the origin of
the mobile coordinate system is found.
The force vector of marine current turbines is obtained, as in the wind turbine, from
the thrust generated by the turbines. The thrust of the marine current turbines is calculated
from the same reasoning used for the calculation of the thrust of the wind turbine.

In Table 7, the water depth is taken from [ 31], the shaft tilt, precone, blade length, and
hub radius are derived from [ 32]. The same values are chosen for the gearbox ratio and
the electrical generator efÔ¨Åciency as for the wind turbine. The data in Tables 8 and 9 were
derived from [32,52].
The modeling of the marine current, as in the case of the wind, was carried out in the
uniform wind shear type [72], using the corresponding equations indicated in [74].
In this work, the implemented modeling of wind turbines and marine currents is a
simple modeling that is based on one-dimensional theory. This theory allows us to obtain a
good approximation in order to know which behavior the steady state response system
will have.

If it is desired to obtain a mathematical model of the turbine that offers the evolution of
the Ô¨Çoating system during its transient state, the blade element momentum theory [ 72,73]
should be used. In addition, by applying the blade element momentum theory, results
are obtained from the characteristics of the aerodynamic airfoils and the dimensions and
inclination in each section of the blades, the characteristics of the electric generator, and the
pitch angle of each blade, allowing the implementation of individual pitch regulators, etc.
Therefore, the output magnitudes obtained with turbines modeled using the blade element
momentum theory offer much richer information. This modeling will be explained in the
second part of this publication.
However, in the modeling of marine current turbines, more factors can be considered
to obtain more complete results, for example, applying unsteady hydrodynamics [ 76] to
the modeling of marine turbines or predicting the occurrence of cavitation [77,78].
3. Results
The tests carried out represent the natural behavior of the Ô¨Çoating system, without
an integrated control system working. The wind was modeled as a vector that affects the
hub of the wind turbine and its entire area using a uniform wind shear model [ 72]. The
marine current was modeled in the same way, affecting the entire area of the two marine
turbines. In addition, the action of the marine current along the entire Ô¨Çoating platform
was modeled using a uniform current shear model.
All simulations were carried out with an 11.4 m/s wind speed and a 1.9 m/s marine
current speed (maximum thrust conditions for turbines) and calm sea (without wave thrust).
This is a theoretical situation, but it could occur in speciÔ¨Åc locations (Table 1). These values
of both the wind and marine current were chosen to limit the Ô¨Çoating hybrid system and
thus are able to be used to study its behavior in unfavorable situations. These values have
also been used in the validation of the model in Appendix E.
In Figures 7, 9, and 11, the thrust vectors and their incidence in the Ô¨Çoating system in
each test are indicated, and in Figures 8, 10, and 12, the respective results of the tests are
shown. In the Supplementary Materials section, you can Ô¨Ånd a video of the behavior of the
Ô¨Çoating system of each test.
3.1. Combination of Thrusts with a Phase Angle of 0 Degrees (Test 1)
In this test, the wind and the marine current have the same direction (Figure 7).
This mainly causes a high displacement in surge (Figure 8a) and a heeling angle in pitch
(Figure 8b).
However, the values reached for the rest of degrees of freedom are not relevant except
for a certain displacement in heave (Figure 8a).
As the wind and marine current have the same orientation, all the thrust of the
three turbines is concentrated in a single direction; this causes the Ô¨Çoating system to
experience a large amount of kinetic energy (Figure 8f), which becomes a considerable
surge displacement (Figure 8a). This situation means that mooring lines 2 and 3 (Figure 2)
must withstand a force greater than 3,000 kN in each of their fairleads (Figure 8g). The
force that the lines of the mooring system would have to support would be even higher if
both the wind and the marine current were oriented 180 degrees, since, in this situation, it
would only be the mooring line 1 that would have to support all the force.
Although the radius of the marine turbines is 10 m [ 32] and that of the wind turbine is
63 m [ 50], the thrust generated by each type of turbine is similar due to the differences in
density between air and water (Figure 8c). However, regarding torque, great differences
are appreciated since the torque depends to a great extent on the radius of the turbine
(Figure 8d). This fact explains the differences in the electrical power generated (Figure 8e),
since torque and power are directly related.

3.2. Combination of Thrusts with a Phase Angle of 180 Degrees (Test 2)
In this case, the wind and the marine current are in opposite directions (Figure 9). This
causes the effect of the thrusts to be counteracted, softening the behavior of the floating system.

 3.2. Combination of Thrusts with a Phase Angle of 180 Degrees (Test 2)  
In this case, the wind and the marine current are in opposite directions  (Figure 9) . 
This causes the effect of the thrusts to be counteracted, softening the beh avior of the float-
ing system.  
 
Figure 9. Combination of thrusts in opposite directions . 
As the sum of the thrusts of the two marine turbines is greater than the thrust of the 
wind turbine, the floating system also experiences surge displacement (Figure 10 a). 
By counteracting the thrusts between the wind turbine and the marine turbines, the 
floating system behaves as if only a minor thrust is produced in the 0 degrees direction. 
Therefore, the kinetic energy that the floating system reaches is less than wha t would be 
expected if this thrust compensation did not occur (Figure 10f). Mooring lines 2 and 3 
must withstand a greater force than mooring line 1 on their fairleads, but less than would 
be expected without this compensation (Figure 10g).  
A striking result is that, being the sum of the thrust of the marine turbines greater 
than thrust of the wind turbine, the angle of heel is produced with a negative pitch (Figure 
10b); this is because the center of rotation of the floating system is close to  its center of 
mass (Table A1 of Appendix A) and the distance of the wind turbine from the center of 
rotation is greater than the distance of the marine turbines from it, which causes a much 
greater angular momentum produced by the wind turbine than that p roduced by the ma-
rine turbines.

By counteracting the thrusts between the wind turbine and the marine turbines, the
Ô¨Çoating system behaves as if only a minor thrust is produced in the 0 degrees direction.
Therefore, the kinetic energy that the Ô¨Çoating system reaches is less than what would be
expected if this thrust compensation did not occur (Figure 10f). Mooring lines 2 and 3 must
withstand a greater force than mooring line 1 on their fairleads, but less than would be
expected without this compensation (Figure 10g).
A striking result is that, being the sum of the thrust of the marine turbines greater
than thrust of the wind turbine, the angle of heel is produced with a negative pitch
(Figure 10b); this is because the center of rotation of the Ô¨Çoating system is close to its

center of rotation is greater than the distance of the marine turbines from it, which causes a
much greater angular momentum produced by the wind turbine than that produced by the
marine turbines.
3.3. Case 3. Combination of Thrusts with a Phase Angle of 90 Degrees (Test 3)
In the latter case, the wind and the marine current are in perpendicular directions
(Figure 11) . This generates important increases in all the degrees of freedom of the float-
ing system.

(Figure 11) . This generates important increases in all the degrees of freedom of the floating

Figure 11.  Combination of thrusts in perpendicular directions . 
The perpendicular orientation of t he wind and the marine current produces a pre-
dominant surge displacement (Figure 12a), it also means that the thrusts between the ma-
rine and wind turbines are not canceled, which leads rotations in two degrees of freedom, 
roll and pitch (Figure 12b); this causes an angle of heel resulting from the combination of 
these. Relevant unwanted oscillations are also produced that can have a negative effect on 
the different subsystems of the floating system (Figure 12). The combination of wind and 
marine current vec tors cause, in the mooring system, an unequal distribution of the forces 
in the fairlead of the lines, with line 3 bearing a greater load (Figure 12g).

3.4. Interpretation of Results and Experimental Conclusions
With these tests, the behavior of the Ô¨Çoating system is exposed in three extreme
combinations of wind vectors and marine currents (phase angles of 0, 90 and 180 degrees)
with values of wind and marine current that generate the maximum thrust in each turbine
(11.4 m/s wind speed and a 1.9 m/s marine current speed).
To analyze the results obtained in detail, it is interesting to compare the simulations
together. In the Ô¨Årst place, the angle of heel (Figure 13) is analyzed as it is one of the most
important magnitudes to know, since factors as important as the generation of energy
and the structural fatigue of the Ô¨Çoating system depend on it. Appendix D shows the
calculation method used for the direction and angle of heel.

binations of wind vectors and marine currents (phase angles of 0, 90 and 180 degrees) with

To analyze the results obtained in detail, it is interesting to compare the simulations 
together. In the first place, the angle of heel (F igure 13) is analyzed as it is one of the most 
important magnitudes to know, since factors as important as the generation of energy and 
the structural fatigue of the floating system  depend on it. Appendix D shows the calcula-
tion method used for the direction and angle of heel.

Figure 13. Comparison of heel angles: ( a) angle of heel; ( b) direction of heel angles. 
Comparing the heeling angles of the three tests (Figure 13a), a greater heeling angle 
is observed when the thrust of the wind turbin e and that of the marine turbines are added 
(Test 1), and a lower heeling angle when the th rusts of the turbines counteract each other 
(Test 2). This allows us to define, for future work, what can be considered a favorable and 
unfavorable combination of operation of the floating system, to correct or take advantage 
of the situation through an automatic control strategy. 
When the wind and marine current are pe rpendicular (Test 3), the floating system 
reaches an intermediate angle of heel. Although this situation seems more favorable than 
that of Test 1, the existing oscillations in the response can negatively affect the integrity of 
the floating system. These oscilla tions also appear in the responses of the rest of the mag-
nitudes of Test 3; minimizing them is another issue to consi der in the design of the control 
strategy. 
Another interesting comparison is knowin g the distance that the floating system 
reaches from its initial position (Figure 14a). This was calculated by obtaining the module 
of the position vector whose caomponents are the displacements in surge, sway, and heave. These displacements are related to the forces that the mooring system must with-
stand. If there is more separation from the in itial position, more elongation of the mooring 
lines occurs. 
Figure 13. Comparison of heel angles: ( a) angle of heel; ( b) direction of heel angles.
Comparing the heeling angles of the three tests (Figure 13a), a greater heeling angle is
observed when the thrust of the wind turbine and that of the marine turbines are added
(Test 1), and a lower heeling angle when the thrusts of the turbines counteract each other
(Test 2). This allows us to deÔ¨Åne, for future work, what can be considered a favorable and
unfavorable combination of operation of the Ô¨Çoating system, to correct or take advantage
of the situation through an automatic control strategy.

reaches an intermediate angle of heel. Although this situation seems more favorable than
that of Test 1, the existing oscillations in the response can negatively affect the integrity
of the Ô¨Çoating system. These oscillations also appear in the responses of the rest of the
magnitudes of Test 3; minimizing them is another issue to consider in the design of the

If there is more separation from the initial position, more elongation of the mooring
lines occurs.
Figure 14b shows the responses of line 3 for the three tests; this line presents the
greatest effort in each test. Comparing the responses in Figure 14a,b, it is veriÔ¨Åed that a
greater distance from the initial position produces a greater stress in the mooring lines.

Figure 14.  Comparison of distance an d force on mooring line: ( a) distance from the starting position; 
(b) force in fairlead of mooring line 3. 
Figure 14b shows the responses of line 3 for the three tests; this line presents the 
greatest effort in each test. Comparing the resp onses in Figure 14a,b, it is verified that a 
greater distance from the initial position pr oduces a greater stress in the mooring lines. 
Analyzing the responses carefully, a high stress is observed in the mooring line of 
Test 3. The explanation is as follows: In Tests 1 and 2, the wind and the marine current 
influence in such a way that, in the floating sy stem, there is always 2 mooring lines sharing 
the efforts‚Äîmooring lines 2 and 3 (Figures 2, 8g and 10g)‚Äîif the responses of Tests 1 and 
2 in Figure 14 are observed, it is verified that the differences‚Äîwhen the responses reach 
the final value‚Äîbetween the distances to the in itial position and the forces of the mooring 
system can be considered quasi-proportional. On the other hand, the combination of the 
wind and the marine current in Test 3 means that the efforts are not distributed between 
two mooring lines, but line 3 supports a greater force than the other two (Figure 12g). This 
situation must also be considered as an unfavorable situation, when all the effort to retain 
the floating system falls on one of the moor ing lines. This must be considered when de-
signing the strength of the mooring lines and can also be considered when designing the 
automatic control strategy. 
The most important comparison is that of electrical power production (Figure 15a) 
since this is the reason for the existence of the floating hybrid system. In Test 2, it is when 
more electrical power is generated, and in Test 1, it is when less electrical power is gener-
ated, Test 3 being an intermediate case. Figure 15b allows us to compare the kinetic energy 
developed by the floating system in each case ; these data are related to the movement of 
the floating system until it has reached a final position, for a determined orientation of the wind and marine current. 
From the results, it can be deduced that th e ideal operatin g situation arises when the 
wind and the marine current have opposite directions and the orientation between the 
two fluids causes the stresses to be distribu ted on two of the mooring lines. On the con-
trary, the most unfavorable situation is when the wind and the marine current have the same direction and their orientation means that one of the three mooring lines must retain 
the floating system. 
Intermediate situations between these tw o extremes produce moderate situations, 
but it is interesting to analyze them from th e point of view of frequency since there were 
oscillations in the similar resp onse analyzed (Test 3) that co uld cause structural problems. 
In these situations, the most common, the desi gn of an adequate control strategy contrib-
utes to minimizing damage to the float ing system, maximizing energy production. 
Figure 14. Comparison of distance and force on mooring line: ( a) distance from the starting position;
(b) force in fairlead of mooring line 3.
Analyzing the responses carefully, a high stress is observed in the mooring line of
Test 3. The explanation is as follows: In Tests 1 and 2, the wind and the marine current
inÔ¨Çuence in such a way that, in the Ô¨Çoating system, there is always 2 mooring lines sharing
the efforts‚Äîmooring lines 2 and 3 (Figures 2, 8g and 10g)‚Äîif the responses of Tests 1 and 2
in Figure 14 are observed, it is veriÔ¨Åed that the differences‚Äîwhen the responses reach the
Ô¨Ånal value‚Äîbetween the distances to the initial position and the forces of the mooring
system can be considered quasi-proportional. On the other hand, the combination of the
wind and the marine current in Test 3 means that the efforts are not distributed between
two mooring lines, but line 3 supports a greater force than the other two (Figure 12g).
This situation must also be considered as an unfavorable situation, when all the effort to
retain the Ô¨Çoating system falls on one of the mooring lines. This must be considered when
designing the strength of the mooring lines and can also be considered when designing the
automatic control strategy.
The most important comparison is that of electrical power production (Figure 15a)
since this is the reason for the existence of the Ô¨Çoating hybrid system. In Test 2, it is
when more electrical power is generated, and in Test 1, it is when less electrical power
is generated, Test 3 being an intermediate case. Figure 15b allows us to compare the
kinetic energy developed by the Ô¨Çoating system in each case; these data are related to the
movement of the Ô¨Çoating system until it has reached a Ô¨Ånal position, for a determined
orientation of the wind and marine current.
From the results, it can be deduced that the ideal operating situation arises when the
wind and the marine current have opposite directions and the orientation between the
two Ô¨Çuids causes the stresses to be distributed on two of the mooring lines. On the contrary,
the most unfavorable situation is when the wind and the marine current have the same
direction and their orientation means that one of the three mooring lines must retain the
Ô¨Çoating system.
Intermediate situations between these two extremes produce moderate situations,
but it is interesting to analyze them from the point of view of frequency since there were
oscillations in the similar response analyzed (Test 3) that could cause structural problems.
In these situations, the most common, the design of an adequate control strategy contributes
to minimizing damage to the Ô¨Çoating system, maximizing energy production.

The main objective of the development of the mathematical model is to analyze the 
stability and energy production of the floating system under different conditions to de-
velop automatic control strategies that improve the behavior of the system, from the poin t 
of view of structural fatigue and the maximum energy generation.  
In this paper, a large part of the developed mathematical model is explained, leaving 
for the second part of this paper the detailed exposition of the modeling of the influencing 
forces on the floating hybrid system. The modeling techniques explained in this work al-
low us to obtain, in a simple way, the modeling of any mechanical system. This is of great 
help in control engineering when reliable modeling is needed without going too deep into  
the mechanical analysis.  
The results presented in Section 3  were  obtained by applying the one-dimensional 
theory to model the thrust of wind and marine current turbines. In the second part of this 
paper, the modeling of turbines using One-dimensional theo ry and Blade element mo-
mentum  theory will also be explained. The Blade element momentum  theory will permit 
the evaluation of the floating hybrid system applying different geometries, aerodynamic 
airfoils, including or eliminating certain elements, etc., also thanks to the availability of 
the inertial characteristics of the single bodies that  make up the floating system  (Appendix 
A) and a simple procedure  (explained in Section 2 .3.2) to process these characteristics and 
obtain the global inertia tensor of the system.  
Therefore, the tests carried out in Section 3  represent the natural behavior of the float-
ing system when it is subjected to the action of the wind and the marine current, without 
an integrated control system working to minimize structural stress while maximizing en-
ergy production. In future work, these control strategies and the re sults obtained will be 
exposed.  
The programming of the FHYGSYS was conducted  in Matlab¬Æ as it is an environment 
oriented to matrix calculation, although it could have been conducted  with any other pro-
gramming language that would allow a similar ease of mat rix calculation. The program-
ming was organized applying the clean code techniques exposed in [79]. Without the ap-
plication of these programming techniques, the realization of FHYGSYS would have been 
much more complicated.  
From the analysis of the tests car ried out in Section 3 , it follows that the smaller the 
angle of heel, the greater the energy production. As this is the main objective of the float-
ing hybrid system, the control system will have to use the angle of heel as the main vari-
able that it will ha ve to minimize. The orientation of the wind and the marine current

that it will have to minimize. The orientation of the wind and the marine current should
also be considered to sacriÔ¨Åce energy production, if necessary, when the hybrid system
approaches the worst-case situation described in the previous section. In this sense, the

set of turbines can work in active stabilization mode to help, as a cooperative control, for
the stabilization of the system. Regarding the possibilities of actuation, the torque of the
turbines must also be considered‚Äîwhich can be controlled for low Ô¨Çuid speeds‚Äîand the
pitch angle that can be used in any range of Ô¨Çuid speeds.
As a complement to the control system, to help increase the stability of the Ô¨Çoating
hybrid system, the possibility of increasing the mooring lines can be considered.
As future work in a forthcoming publication, cooperative control techniques that make
compatible the achievement of maximum structural stability and optimal performance of
the generation of the Ô¨Çoating system will be addressed.
While the proposed model uses a horizontal WT, using a vertical WT is a possibility
that could be explored in the future. In terms of power generation, horizontal WT works
better [ 80], and it is more efÔ¨Åcient because there are few wind angle changes. This is the
most probable scenario in the locations described in the introduction with high wind speed
and high marine currents. On the other hand, vertical WT has half the weight for the same
power, which is an advantage for stability, and it works better with the wind changing
directions. Future works will explore the use of vertical WTs in order to test the beneÔ¨Åts of
this kind of turbine.

Appendix A.8. Inertial Properties of the Marine Current Blades
Tables A13 and A14 show the inertial characteristics of the clockwise marine current
blades, while Tables A15 and A16 include those of the counterclockwise blades. The Ô¨Årst
column of each table shows the moments and products of inertia oriented with the local
coordinate system (Figure A8) and the other two columns, oriented respect to the mobile
coordinate system. The center of mass‚Äîor center of buoyancy‚Äîis expressed in each of the

Appendix B
This appendix shows, as an example, the necessary rotations of the wind blade inertia
tensor to align it with the mobile coordinate system. This operation is performed for all
three blades. Table A17 shows the values of the angles that the inertia tensor is going to be
rotate. The angles between the blades, the precone angle and the shaft tilt angle are Ô¨Åxed
values taken from [ 50]. The azimuth angle is the angular position of the wind turbine axis,
and the nacelle yaw angle is the rotation made by the nacelle to orient itself in the direction
of the wind‚Äîif the Ô¨Çoating system is in its initial position, these two values are zero.

Through Equation (8) the inertia tensor of the wind blade‚ÄîÔ¨Årst column of Table A8‚Äî
is prepared, then Equations (12) and (13) is applied with the unit vectors obtained with
Equation (A3). With this operation, the inertia tensors of the last three columns of Table A8
are calculated by choosing an angle between blades, 0, 120 or 240 degrees, respectively.
Appendix C
Since the mathematical model bases its operation on fundamental operations such
as differentiation and integration, methods must be used that allow these operations to
be carried out with an acceptable margin of error. These operations are performed with
respect to the time differential used for the simulation, so numerical differentiation and
integration techniques must be used.
Different differentiation methods were tested and, using procedures less precise than
that indicated in Appendix C.1, the results have not been considered acceptable.
Regarding the integration method, applying what is explained in Appendix C.2, better
results are obtained, for the same time differential, than using simpler methods such as
the trapezoidal rule. This allows us to obtain results with an acceptable error with a time
difference of 0.1 s.
Appendix C.1. Numerical Differentiation Method of Richardson‚Äôs Extrapolation
It is initially based on the expansion of the Taylor series backwards to the third
derivative term Equation (A4) [69].
f(xi 1)=f(xi) f0(xi)Dt+f00(xi)
2!Dt2 f000(xi)
3!Dt3(A4)
The terms of the second and third derivatives of (A4) are replaced by the backward
Ô¨Ånite divided difference Formulas (A5) and (A6) [ 69]. Where xiand xi-iare the value of the
function to be derived at the current and previous times, respectively, and Dtthe value of

Combining (A4)‚Äì(A6) gives an estimate of the derivative (A7) with an error O(h2) [69].

Applying the expression of Richardson‚Äôs extrapolation (A9) [ 69], an estimation of the

If more precision is desired, Richardson‚Äôs extrapolation can still be applied recursively.
Appendix C.2. Numerical Integration Method of Romberg‚Äôs Algorithm
The integration method of Romberg‚Äôs algorithm is based on the iterative application of
Richardson‚Äôs extrapolation, similar to how it is conducted in numerical differentiation [ 69].
For this, the multiple application trapezoidal rule (A13)‚Äì(A15) is initially applied [69].

I(4Dt)=Dtf(xi)+2(f(xi 1)+f(xi 2)+f(xi 3))+f(xi 4)
8(A15)
Equations (A13)‚Äì(A15) have an error O(h2), combining them through (A16) and (A17),
approximations of the integral with error O(h4) are obtained [69].

Finally, Equations (A16) and (A17) are combined using Equation (A18) obtaining an
error O(h6) [69]. To obtain the result of the integral over time, the value of the integral at
the previous instant ( I(i-1)) is added at each instant of time. As in the case of differentiation,
if more precision is desired, Richardson‚Äôs extrapolation can still be applied recursively.

Appendix E
In this appendix, the validation carried out for the mathematical model is exposed.
The validation was made from simulations obtained with FAST8 that were compared with
simulations, under the same conditions, obtained with FHYGSYS. Comparisons were made
for many situations; in this appendix, four representative situations have been selected that
allow us to infer the behavior of FHYGSYS.
To compare the results with FAST8, the model of a Ô¨Çoating system equivalent to the
one shown in Figure 2 was used, but without including the marine current turbines, that is,
an OC3-Hywind model [31] (Figure A9).

Figure A9. OC3 -Hywind  Model used to Test the Validation.  
To compose the model, the inertial characteristics of the floating platform (Tables A3 
and A4), of the tower (Table A5), of the nacelle (Table A6), of the hub (Table A7 ), and of 
the blades (Table A8) were  used.  
To comple te the modeling of the OC3 -Hywind system, it is necessary to use a ballast 
with different characteristics from those indicated in Table A3. This is to match the inertial 
characteristics of the floating platform -ballast set with those indicated in [31].  
In fact, this was conducted  prior to the ballast design of the floating hybrid system 
described in Figure 2, since validation was the first task performed before incorporating 
the tidal current turbines into the OC3 -Hywind system. The inertial charac teristics of the 
ballast used are shown in Table A18.

the tidal current turbines into the OC3-Hywind system. The inertial characteristics of the
ballast used are shown in Table A18.

FAST8 does not calculate the force and moment values of the viscous drag loads. In
order to validate these forces obtained with FHYGSYS, Equations (A21) and (A22) is used.
In this way the value of the forces resulting from the simulation with FAST8 is obtained
indirectly from the data in Table A11.
