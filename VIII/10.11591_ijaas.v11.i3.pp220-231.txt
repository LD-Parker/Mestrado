1. INTRODUCTION  
In recent years, developers of offshore wind farms have begun  using turbines with capacities in the 
order of significantly higher megawatts. The offshore wind energy industry needs to have turbines, 
converters, foundations, cables, and other resources that have higher efficiency as well as less labor and other 
resou rces. When compared with onshore wind energy systems, offshore wind power generation has some 
advantages, as shown in Figure 1. These advantages include higher power generation due to less turbulence 
and roughness, higher plant load factor, and reduced bot tlenecks in land acquisition and logistics 
management. These advantages are present although offshore wind power generation faces challenges such 
as foundation design in the sea, vessel management, and operation and maintenance aspects.  
As of the 31st of January in the year 2022, the total installed capacity of wind farms in India to 
generate energy reached 40.10 gigawatts (GW). According to the aim set by the Ministry of New and 
Renewable Energy of the Government of India [1], it is predicted that an additional 20 GW would be 
accomplished on or before December 31, 2022. In the year 2020, the global installed capacity for the 
generation of wind power is expected to be around 743 GW, which will mak e wind energy a substantial 
component of the current and future energy supply systems. As can be seen in Figure 2, by the end of the 
year 2020, 35 GW worth of offshore wind power generation had been placed throughout the world. China,

Europe, and the rest of the world made up the majority of this total, as can be seen in Figure 2. Along with 
Japan's ambition of having ten GW of offshore capacity by the year 2030, new actors from Asia such as the 
Republic of Korea and Taiwan have made their contributions.  
The main wind power companies Enel (Italy), Equinor (Norway), Orsted, RWE (Germany), and 
Vattenfall (Sweden) have all announced their intentions to create hydrogen or methane from wind energy 
beginning in the year 2020. Major wind energy producers have been shifting their attention more and more 
toward the repowering of the wind power generator market sector around the globe, and notably onshore. 
There have been efforts made to repurpose old blades or develop blades made of entirely different materials, 
as we ll as efforts made to develop new solutions for recycling and reusing old blade composite materials [2]. 
In addition, there have been efforts made to develop new blades made of entirely different materials.  
Figure 3 is an illustration of the increasing sizes of wind turbines between the years 1990 and 2020. 
It also shows the growth of power electronics with ratings and its functional significance in the context of the 
illustration. For offshore wind energy sy stems, floating platforms such as spar -buoy, tension leg platform, 
and semi -submersible are also available [3], [4] .

2. VARIOUS TECHNOL OGIES AND TRENDS IN OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY SYSTEMS  
2.1. Overview of off shore wind farms  
Ali et al. [5] have studied the overview of offshore  wind farms and it  is associated issues like grid 
integration, power quality, stability, voltag e control and frequency deviation, grid code requirements, energy 
storage solutions and low voltage ride through mechanisms. The most recent study on wind farm layout 
optimization and electrical system design, including cable connection techniques, was ana lyzed by  
Hou et al. [6]. Lakshmanan et al. [7] have conducted research on the various types of electrical collection 
systems found in offshor e wind farms. These systems have been categorized as medium voltage alternative 
current ( AC) collection, medium voltage direct current ( DC) collection systems, and low frequency AC 
collection systems. Additionally, the researchers have elaborated on the op erational characteristics and 
challenges associated with each type.  
 
2.2. Design point of view  
An electrical layout design optimization technique for offshore wind farms has been described by 
Chen et al.  [8]. This method makes use of fuzzy c -means and binary integer programming methods in order 
to automatically assign wind turb ines to the closest substations in the electrical network. They have improved 
the topological architecture of the cables that are utilized in the process of connecting wind turbines or 
turbines to substations. This is done to ensure that the expenses assoc iated with connecting the cables and 
experiencing power loss during transmission are reduced to the greatest extent possible.  
Jiang et al.  [9] have discussed the cable size selection of an offshore multiplatform interconnected 
wind power system to achieve accurate optimization of its system planning through a mixed -integer linear 
programming expansio n planning model. They have also presented the impact of the maximum penetration 
rate of wind power on the total cost of the system.  Musasa et al. [10] looked into the possibility of using a 
DC collection grid in an offshore wind farm. This was accomplished by employing a radial connection of 
active rectifiers, which  consisted of a three -phase half -controlled switch voltage source converter (VSC) 
cascaded with a single active bridge DC-DC converter. Using the power simulator software , simulations are 
run, and the resulting data is analyzed and compared to the performa nce of ring feeder configurations in 
terms of power loss, cost, voltage/current ripple, power factor, and other metrics. Furthermore, the software's 
control performance is illustrated.  
 
2.3. Power evacuation perspective  
Iosifidou et al . [11] have analyzed three types of power system interconnection of offsho re wind 
farms: i) High voltage AC to the nearest onshore point of interconnection (POI); ii) H igh voltage DC with 
voltage source converter (HVDC -VSC) to the nearest onshore POI; and iii) C onnecting to an offshore HVDC 
backbone running parallel to shore that interconnects multiple wind power plants and multiple POIs ashore in 
the Atlantic Ocean close to the cities of New York, Philadelphia, Annapolis, and Norfolk.  Neumann et al. 
[12] discussed the advantages of using 66  kV for near -shore and medium -distance offshore wind farms for 
both U nited Kingdom (UK)  and international demonstration wind farm projects. When compared  to 33  kV 
systems for several close and medium -distance -to-shore wind farms, the techno -economic results show that

lowering the quantity of undersea cable and related losses at the Blyth offshore demonstration site in the UK 
leads to a reduction in capi tal cost and full -life benefits.  
Soleimanzadeh et al . [13] evaluated the cost -effective provision of reactive power in an offshore 
transmission system for a 295 megawatt (MW) offshore wind farm off the Dutch coast in order to achieve a 
unity power factor at the grid entry point in accordance with  Dutch grid code criteria. Using the steady state 
electrical system design and analysis  tool, EeFarm -II, in the MATLAB/ Simulink environments, two distinct 
techniques for reactive power provisioning have been investigated and implemented . They were  for 150 kV 
and 220  kV AC transmission voltage levels.  
Ferr et al . [14] investigated the benefits of combining kinetic energy storage from wind turbines 
with DC-link energy storage of a voltage source converter -based high voltage DC (VSC -HVDC) link . It is to 
facilitate fast primary frequency control and system inertia to the existing ac network for the purpose of 
providing fast frequency response without the need for any auxiliary requirements. This was done in order to 
facilitate fast primary frequency contro l and system inerti a. 
Rúa and Cutululis  [15] conducted a state -of-the-art review of electrical cable optimization in 
offshore wind farms. They analyzed the optimum sizing of electrical cables based on static -rated sizing, 
dynamic load cycle profile, and cable lifetime estimation under time -varying conditions with respect to the 
number and location of offshore substations versus onshore connection points. Additionally, they looked at 
how the optimal sizing of electrical cables affected the overall cost of the project.  
Researchers [16], [17]  developed a low frequency alternating current transmission scheme (16.7 Hz 
or 20 Hz) for the cost -effective connection of large -scale long distance wind energy in comparison to r high 
voltage  alternating current (HVAC) and HVDC. This was accomplished by exploring the distance ranges 
with respect to offshore and remote onshore wind energy systems. A modular multiple DC transformer -based 
DC transmission system was described in detail by Hu et al . [18]. This system employed a permanent 
magnetic synchronous generator based offshore wind farm grid  connection. This system had the benefits of 
fewer conversion stages, higher efficiency, and lower cost thanks to built -in power systems computer aided 
design/electromagnetic transients including DC (PSCAD/EMTDC) simulation, along with a down -scaled 
experi mental prototype.  
Ferdinand and Monti [19] studied the impact of electrical characteristics on the inrush curr ent in the 
transformer in HVDC -connected offshore wind farms. Specifically, they focused on excitation, switching 
angle, and residual core magnetization as the electrical parameters of interest. Simulating electromagnetic 
transients and carrying out measur ements in the field were two more methods they used to investigate how it 
operated. In order to lessen the impact of the inrush current, this was done.  
Using wavelet noise reduction, Clarke ’s transform, Stockwell ’s transform, and decision tree (WRC -
SDT). W ang et al.  [20] presented a novel hybrid online detection method for offshore wind farm 
transmission lines. This method is used to classify di fferent types of faults by obtaining the transmission line 
fault Eigenvalues.  
Xue et al. [21] have work ed on transient frequency control strategy for power system interconnected 
with offshore wind power through VSC -HVDC based on special sequence and sensitivities, which includes 
thermal units’ regulation, wind power regulation, DC modulation and load sheddi ng. Chen et al. [22] have 
developed a power optimization model using particle swarm optimization algorithm for the offshore wind 
turbines for maximum power generation by employing centralized voltage source converter.  
Zhang et al. [23] looked into resonance -induced harmonic distortion and stability difficulties at an 
offshore wind farm that used doubly fed induction generators and was connected to a high -voltage direct 
current gri d. They were also able to capture its dynamic features, which they used to highlight the 
significance of adding frequency coupling in sub -synchronous resonance stability evaluations using 
MATLAB /Simulink simulations.  
Using simulations for the IEEE 118 -bus system, Li et al . [24] have established an integrated 
planning model of optimum siting and size for VSC -HVDC link -based offshore wind farms. Additionally, 
they have used shunt capacitors to optimize the voltage profile and reactive power needs. Zhan et al. [25] 
have presented a hybrid modified total direct costs (MTDC) scheme as a means of integrating a number of 
offshore wi nd farms into onshore power grids at a variety of locations using PSCAD/EMTDC as the 
modeling platform. They used computer simulations to evaluate their plan under a variety of scenarios, 
including as start -up, changes in wind speed, and the disconnection of VSCs. This was done to guarantee that 
the system would run smoothly and that electricity would be distributed appropriately across onshore AC 
grids.  
An optimization formulation was proposed by Sedighi et al . [26]. It was to find the optimal 
electrical intercon nection configuration of wind turbines and the optimal cable sizing simultaneously using a 
harmony search algorithm. The goal of this formulation is to achieve lower costs to augment energy 
production portfolios.

Using the MATLAB/Simulink platform, Abu -Elanien et al . [27] analyzed the performance of the 
MTDC system by determining the types of outages necessary to maintain system transient stability under a 
variety of conditions, including sparsity of wind power, line over current, outage of lines connected to wind 
farms, and outage of lines connected to AC grids. These conditions were simulated using the MTDC system. 
The implementation of hierarchical control for the combined AC/MTDC grid that included  the integration of 
offshore wind farms was given by Chachar et al. [28]. 
Kunjumuhammed et al. [29] provided a modal study of a large offshore wind farm that made use of 
permanent magnet synchronous generator type wind turbines coupled to voltage source converter HVDC. 
They observed various resonance fre quencies for the purpose of stability investigations. Nguyen [30] 
evaluated hybrid control method bas ed on distributed consensus control and central model predictive control 
to analyze the complexity of the communication network in a large -scale offshore wind farm in hardware -in-
the-loop simulation using OPAL -RT technologies. This was done by simulating t he wind farm using OPAL -
RT Technologies.  
 
2.4. Operational point of view  
The effects of fatigue on a wind turbine's operating life have been researched by Qiu et al. [31] with 
the purpose of optimizing its design. They used a variety of turbulence scales to quantify gearbox load 
spectrum variation and cumulative fatigue damage, with the goal of predicting gearbox service life as a result 
of random wind speeds with a certai n statistical distribution. This information can be used for the 
optimization of gearbox design for offshore wind turbines through simulation.  
An enhanced unit commitment model with energy storage and flexible CO 2 capture was developed 
by Bruce et al. [32] by analyzing high resolution on/offshore  wind data, probabilistic wind power forecasts, 
and model wind imbalances at operational timescales for the UK in order to illustrate the generation 
flexibility requirements and nonlinear impacts of increasing wind capacity on power plant operating regimes . 
This was done in order to help the UK meet its renewable energy targets. Researchers led by Tao et al.  [33] 
have conducted research on wind turbines with decreased size in order to validate the circuit parameter 
formulae and circuit model for Chinese -made offshore wind turbines.  
 
2.5. Based on reliability evaluation  
Besnard et al. [34] have developed a model that can be used to optimize the maintenance support 
organization of an offshore wind farm. The model takes into account the location of maintenance 
accommodation, the number of t echnicians, the choice of transfer vessels, and the utilization of a helicopter. 
It also takes into account the reliability, the logistic costs, and the price of electricity.  
Chao et al. [35] discussed the sequential Markov chain Monte Carlo model for reliability evaluation 
of offshore wind farms taking into consideration the impact of severe offshore weather. They did this by 
analyzing the failure rate of wind turbines due to wind speed and l ightning, and they suggested effective 
solutions for the reliable operation of the farms. An examination of the supervisory control and data 
collection platform for monitoring the functioning of the Lillgrund offshore wind farm has been provided by 
Papathe ou et al. [36]. This research uses a robust machine -learning technique to anticipate measurements of 
power output from each wind turbine.  
Abeynayake et al . [37] suggested a comprehensive method for the availability evaluation of the  
radial large -scale Anholt wind farm that is situated in Denmark. This technique combines multi -state Markov 
processes with universal generating function.  
A real -time simulation model has been developed by Song et al . [38] in order to in vestigate the 
performance losses of offshore wind turbines that are caused by ice creep loads. This was done in order to 
guarantee both safety and a high degree of power tracking capacity. The steady functioning of offshore wind 
turbines under different ti me delay circumstances has been analyzed by Tang et al. [39] in order to remove 
the steady state error induced by external disturbance and increase the stability of wind turbines.  
 
2.6. Based on co mmunication/autonmous operation  
Ullah et al. [40] have conducted research on the combination of LoRaWAN massive machine -type 
connectivity (mMTC) technology with low earth orbit satellites for the purpose of remote monitoring  of 
offshore wind farms. Hasager et al . [41] investigated the climate of the offshore wind in Ice land using 
satellite synthetic aperture radar, the measurements from coastal meteorological stations, and the results of 
two different atmospheric model data sets called HARMONIE and NORA10 to find wind speed and wind 
direction measurements. In order to cu t down on inspection time, man hours, and the associated risk for the 
workers in the Walney offshore wind farm, Chung et al . [42] developed a placement optimization for 
unmanned aerial vehicles to use during automated inspections of turbines. This was done in order to reduce 
inspection time.

Recent developments in offshore wind energy systems: Technologies and practices  (Saravanan  Vasudevan ) 225 
Mitchell et al . [43] developed a symbiotic system of systems approach that makes use of a 
symbiotic digital architecture to provide a cyber physical orchestrat ion for safe and resilient autonomous 
robotics in offshore wind farms. This approach provides enhanced run -time operational resilience and safety 
compliance to beyond visual line of s ight autonomous missions. Reddy and Stuber [44] have outlined the 
challenges of marine seismic acquisition and designed a buoy -based wireless backhaul network for hi gh-rate 
data transfer over the ocean surface. They have also developed Wi -buoy for real -time, scalable, and energy -
efficient data delivery through  a buoy -based power -saving backhaul scheme. Wi -buoy was developed in 
order to save power while still deliverin g data in a timely manner.  
 
 
3 STATUS OF OFF SHORE WIND POWER GENERATION IN INDIA  
In order to ensure the nation's continued access to a reliable supply of energy over the long term, 
India, which has a coastline that is over 7,600 kilometers long, investigated  the viability of using offshore 
wind energy as a "strategic energy source." The Indian government published its National Offshore Wind 
Energy strategy in September of 2015, and the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy was given the 
responsibility of actin g as the Nodal Ministry to develop the offshore wind industry. In the context of 
initiatives supported by the European Union, such as Facilitating Offshore Wind in India (FOWIND)  and 
First offshore Wind Project in India (FOWPI) , India has begun the basic stages of the process of developing 
offshore wind power.  
The National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE) has started the preliminary assessment process by 
placing met masts, which serve as representatives for the evaluation of the offshore wind potential. Along the 
coast of India, the FOWIND consortium has conducted resource assessment and preliminary feasibility 
studies. Additionally, they have demarcated eight zones each in the Gulf of Khambhat in Gujarat and the 
Gulf of Mannar in  Tamil Nadu. These zones cover a total area of 17706 km2 and 10558 km2 respectively. 
The FOWIND study served as the basis for NIWE's decision to begin verification and validation research in 
Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, the demographic regions of which are show n in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. Off 
the coast of Gujarat, in the Gulf of Khambhat, the FOWIND Consortium was successful in November 2017 
in commissioning India's first offshore  light detection and ranging  (LiDAR ) [45], [46] .

Offshore wind power is being promoted via the FOWIND project, which is being sponsored by the 
European Union and is being directed by the global wind energy council (GWEC). This is being done to aid 
India's transition towards a future with less reliance on carbon -based energy. MeteoPole is a consulting firm 
based in France with an office in Hyderabad, India. They provide services at each stage of the development 
of wi nd farm projects, with a primary focus on reducing financial risks through the use of a variety of 
cutting -edge technologies. These technologies range from cloud -based wind simulations to LiDAR 
measurements (ZephyCloud). MeteoPole has been selected as the official LiDAR provider for the evaluation

of offshore wind power by Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program (CSTEP ), acting on behalf of 
the FOWIND project consortium.  
The wind cube  LiDAR equipment is portable, can be easily installed on any stable platform, it has 
very good accuracy and data availability at heights of 40 m to 200 m, speed variations up t o 0.1 m/s and 
direction up to 20  at a sampling frequency of 1 Hz, averaged at  10 minute  intervals. Additionally, the 
windcube  LiDAR equipment can measure speed variations up to 0.1 m/s and direction s up to 2 0. NIWE has 
provided two sets of offshore Lidar wind data, one covering the period from November 2017 to November 
2018, and the o ther covering the period from December 2018 to November 2019, which together provide 
comprehensive recommendations for the development of offshore wind systems in India. During the month 
of December 2017, FOWIND published a repo rt titled "From zero to five  GW–offshore wind outlook for 
Gujarat and Tamil  Nadu (2018 -2032)". This report lists the policy and regulatory framework aspects of 
achieving 5 GW worth of offshore wind installations in the states of Gujarat and Tamil  Nadu by the year 
2032 [47]. 
 
 
4 STAGES INVOLVED IN OFF SHORE WIND POWER GENERATION  
Offshore wind power generation has to address the following aspects [48]: i) Wind resource 
assessment  (WRA), zone selection discusses the man y instruments and methods used for offshor e WRA to 
determine its potential, includin g as LiDAR  and sound navigation and ranging  (SONAR ) technology; ii)  
Foundations and structures is where we talk about the many different kinds of foundations, such as monop ile, 
gravity based, jacket type, tripods, high rise pile cap (HRPC), or for the newest floating type designs ; iii) This 
section of energy yield's turbine/generator selection guide goes through the various kinds of wind turbines 
and how electricity is gener ated; iv)  Sub-stations is concerned with both unmanned offshore and manned 
onshore types of sub -stations, which are used for the purpose of transferring electricity from an offshore wind 
farm to t he grid located on the mainland; v)  Sub-marine cabling provi des in -depth information on a variety of 
power evacuation methods, underwater cabling, and the accompanying engineering for either AC/DC, 
depending on the budgetary const raints and scope of the project; vi)  Supervisory control and data acquisition  
(SCADA ) and communication explain international standards relating to network and communication for 
offshore wind power projects and their compliance. These standards are applicable to offshore wind power 
projects; vii)  Marine and Ports is concerned with the prer equisites as well as the infrastructure at the ports 
that will be necessary for the development of an offshore wind f arm and their corresponding O  & M; viii) 
Vessels and other related equipment Vessels are a piece of equipment that is necessary for installin g offshore 
wind turbines, building foundations, and erecting huge offshore structures. These vessels are particularly 
constructed and are the most significant component of the equipment;  ix) Additional considerations such as 
energy output, operations and m aintenance, the cost of energy, dangers, and social and environmental eco -
systems ; and x)  The locating of possible growth areas for the company's future operations.  
 
 
5 OFFSHORE WIND POWER GENERATI ON TECHNOLOGIES  
As part of the process of planning the overall project, a decision must be made between HVAC  and 
HVDC  based on line commutated converter (HVDC LCC), or voltage source -based HVDC (HVDC VSC), or 
modular multilevel converter (MMC) for the tran smission of power from an offshore plant to a grid 
connection point [49]. Offshore wind farms may choose to use smart grid technologies in order to address the 
electrical design issues that aris e in offshore power networks. These technologies have the benefits of 
increased reliability, flexibility, and efficiency, and they can help mitigate the specific problems that arise 
with transmission and distribution of power, such as: i) high temperature superconducting cables and ii) 
flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) devices including SVC, static synchronous compensator 
(STATCOM), fault current limiters, voltage control and VAR support devices, and unified power flow 
controller (UPFC) [50]. Figure  6 shows  double fed induction machine (DFIM )-based wind turbine  and  
Figure  7 shows a  full size converter -based wind turbine . A typical technologi cal solution for offshore wind 
farms connection is in Figures 8 and 9. They have VSC or MMC based HVDC power evacuation strategies 
as explained earlier.

6 COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE FOR OFFSHORE WIND FARMS  
The wind power plant control system and the wind turbines are connected by a communications 
connection that is provided by the wind power plant communication network. This covers both the hardware 
components (wires, transducers, fiber optics, repeaters, an d switches) and the software protocols (Ethernet, 
transmission co ntrol protocol/internet protocol  (TCP/IP ), wireless, Zigbee, and passive optical network) that 
are used to transport information between the wind turbines and the wind plant management system . 
Components that are necessary for the functioning of wind power plants are covered by the international 
standard known as IEC 61400 -25 [52]–[54]. 
The communication network for the offshore wind  farm is somewhat autonomous from the public 
power grid thanks to the SCADA technology that it uses. This link exists between the control center and each 
individual wind turbine. Even if the transmission distance of an offshore wind farm is rather lengthy in 
comparison to a local area network (LAN ) for a substation network, the communication network inside an 
offshore wind  farm may still be handled as a LAN , as shown in Figure 10. Here, the controller that is 
installed on each wind turbine receives all of t he essential data from the devices that are attached to the wind 
turbine and then transfers that data to the control center of the wind farm. They distribute the orders that

come from the control center to the various equipment that are used to operate the  wind turbines. SCADA 
stands for supervisory control and data acquisition, and it is used to refer to the network that enables 
communication between controllers and the computer that serves as the control center.

7 TECHNOLOGY IMPACT ASSESMENT STUDIES IN OFFSHORE WIND FARMS  
The research projects [55]–[57] have been carried out in order to evaluate the consequences, such as 
stability and power quality concerns, while connecting offshore wind power production to a power system:  i) 
Risk evaluation of submarine HVAC/HVDC cable system design and protection studi es for array and export 
cables; ii) Development of electrical grid design including FACTS devices and design guidelines for smart 
grid communication infrastructure  with the existing power system; iii)  Erection of offshore substation, 
HVAC/HVDC system and support structures for wind farms addressing lightning and emergency response 
protection due t o onshore disasters/geo hazards; and iv)  Impact study on power system stability and power 
quality improvement for wind power system.  
Furthermore, onshore wind pow er project implementation needs : i) Grid planning and development;

capital; iv) C arbon trading mechanisms; v) Environmental/met station/geophysical/geot echnical surveys; vii) 
Power evacuation studies; and viii) I nter-agency coordination by government /policy 
makers /tatutory /certification bodies. Competence in wind turbine/generator development, condition 
monitoring systems, global collaborations, an d project financing by prospective project developers, suppli ers, 
and manufacturers, and R  & D investment is vital. Support from financial institutions and investors, marine 
developers and vessel operators, and cable manufacturers is also needed. It should a lso address future issues 
such as energy cost reduction, increased investor confidence, environmental and human impact assessment, 
and public acceptance.  
 
 
8 CHALLENGES AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY  
Offshore wind has few technical, regulatory  and operational challenges in India  [58]–[60], which 
includ es: i) The increased complexity of the structures and foundations required for offshore wind turbines 
results in increased expenses for their installation ; ii) Wind farms located at sea are notoriously tough to 
maintain financially and tricky to run when e xposed to severe weath er like hurricanes and typhoons; and iii) 
There are a limited number of local substructure manufacturers, installation boats, and skilled people.  
A detailed set of recommendations detailing the necessary elements for building a policy, 
regulatory, grid integration, and funding framework for offshore wind energy system are provided.  They are: 
i) Renewable purchase obligation:  Through a mechanism known as a renewable purchase obligation, power 
distribution firms, open access custom ers, and captive users have the opportunity to make clean energy 
purchases as part of their overall electricity consumption; ii) Lower taxes:  Good and service tax  and excise 
duties should be exempted for various components of offshore wind energy systems a nd tax credits should be 
given at the ear ly stage of project development; iii) Feed -in tariff:  Discoms have the ability to implement 
feed-in tariff (FiT) laws and make the purchase of offshore wind electricity obligatory. The FiT may also be 
adapted to mee t the specific needs of any offshore wind project. The inherent risk in the generation of 
renewable energy may be mitigated by the use of a long -term contract and price guarantee, which in turn 
encourages investment and growth. In addition, distribution co mpanies should guarantee preferential

payments fo r offshore wind energy projects; iv) Deemed generation provision:  Concerns about curtailment 
need to be addressed, and state load dispatch centres (SLDCs) should be given the authority to evacuate 
substantia l amounts of electricity. This may be accomplished by enabling "deemed generation provision." 
Offshore wind energy projects also need to be safeguarded. SLDCs and regional load dispatch centers are 
able to access the state or regional unscheduled interchan ge pool in order to fund compensation payments. 
The Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. should be responsible for the development of the undersea power 
evacua tion and the subsea substations; and v) Single window clearance : The National Institute of Wind 
Energy (NIWE) need to be granted the authority to provide single -window approval for all offshore wind 
energy projects in India.  
Finding prospective solutions to mapping spatial competition, ocean space for energy and food, 
marine aquaculture, transportatio n, shipping services, maritime trade, merchant fleet, movement of special 
vessels, ship building, ports expansion, coastal and cruise tourism, desalination, deep sea minerals, energy 
transition, ocean health, capture fisheries, and regulation of oil and ch emical spills are some of the other 
challenges associated with offshore wind energy systems.  
 
 
9 CONCLUSION  
The production of electricity using wind from offshore locations has undergone a substantial 
transition in terms of installed capacity and technologic al maturity, and it has tremendous development 
potential for the foreseeable future. This article presents a comprehensive literature review of offshore wind 
power production, including a discussion of recent technical breakthroughs as well as the steps th at are 
involved in the implementation process. The current state and future prospects of offshore wind power 
generator  in India are covered in this article, along with some suggestions for effective offshore wind power 
development. Also included are develo pments in technology linked with power transmission, smart grids, 
and communication infrastructure in offshore wind energy systems. The power system studies point of view 
is also included in this briefing on the technology impact evaluation of offshore win d power production.
