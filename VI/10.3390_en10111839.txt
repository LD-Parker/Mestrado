Abstract: A wind turbine is a very well-known archetype of energy conversion system working at
non-stationary regimes. Despite this, a deep mechanical comprehension of wind turbines operating
in complicated conditions is still challenging, especially as regards the analysis of experimental data.
In particular, wind turbines in complex terrain represent a very valuable testing ground because of
the possible combination of wake effects among nearby turbines and ﬂow accelerations caused by
the terrain morphology. For these reasons, in this work, a cluster of four full-scale wind turbines
from a very complex site is studied. The object of investigation is vibrations, at the level of the
structure (tower) and drive-train. Data collected by the on-board condition monitoring system are
analyzed and interpreted in light of the knowledge of wind conditions and operating parameters
collected by the Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA). A free ﬂow Computational
Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation is also performed, and it allows one to better interpret the vibration
analysis. The main outcome is the interpretation of how wakes and ﬂow turbulences appear in the
vibration signals, both at the structural level and at the drive-train level. Therefore, this wind to gear
approach builds a connection between ﬂow phenomena and mechanical phenomena in the form of
vibrations, representing a precious tool for assessing loads in different working conditions.

1. Introduction
Energy supply is undergoing a long-term process of conversion towards sustainability, through
the exploitation of renewable technologies and low-carbon energy sources. Wind energy is considered
one of the most important sources in order to reach the target of halving CO 2emissions by 2050:
an amount from 15% to 18% of global electricity should be produced from wind energy, and this
should avoid emissions up to 4.8 gigatonnes of CO 2per year [ 1]. In 2016, wind energy covered
4% of the global electricity demand, reaching 487 GW eof capacity [ 2]. Some European countries
(Denmark, Germany, Ireland) cover up to 30% of their global demand with wind energy [ 1]. In this
context, there is a strong industrial demand for improving wind turbine lifetime and optimizing the
production output, which meets also ambitious scientiﬁc perspectives. The stochastic and very local

nature of wind makes it difﬁcult even to comprehend wind ﬂow at the microscale level. Usually, several
assumptions are needed in order to solve the Navier–Stokes equations, as for example steadiness.
A fortiori, it is challenging to model the behavior of wind turbines with respect to the wind ﬂow.
This is a pressing issue because the main cause of producible energy loss in a wind farm is typically
given by wake effects between nearby turbines [ 3,4]. The widespread diffusion of control systems at
affordable cost and of storage systems for medium-sized datasets has been an important turning point
in the wind energy industry. Data are the keystone of our era, and similarly, SCADA have given a
signiﬁcant boost to the improvement of wind farm practice. Not only the comprehension of wind ﬂow
and wakes has obtained an experimental counterpart for model validations [ 5,6], but also data analysis
has become a branch of research in wind energy. Despite SCADA data analysis being believed to
highlight anomalies as late-stage indications of occurring mechanical faults, impressive achievements
have been reached in the use of SCADA for condition monitoring and prognostics [7,8].
As regards wind turbine faults, gearbox breakdowns are particularly burdensome and frequent.
For this reason, noticeable attention is devoted to them, since, for instance, it is estimated [ 9] that a
sudden failure of a 1.5-MW wind turbine during winter (when wind intensity is usually higher) leads
to around e50,000 of missed production. Therefore, SCADA data have been employed for gearbox
fault diagnosis. For example, in [ 10], gearbox oil temperatures recorded by SCADA have been used
for the detection of incipient gearbox failures. Oil temperature has been exploited in [ 11] as well for
the condition monitoring of wind turbine drive-lines. In [ 12], a condition monitoring method based on
deep neural networks is proposed by using the gearbox lubricant pressure provided by SCADA.
In [10], a bird’s eye view of condition monitoring techniques for the wind turbine gearbox is
provided. There are basically three: SCADA-based condition monitoring, oil particle analysis and
vibration analysis. SCADA-based condition monitoring and oil particle counting are somehow based
on the recognition of some kind of consequence induced by the anomalous motion of any mechanical
part in a damaged or degraded system. The most powerful, and at the same time most demanding,
technique is the straightforward analysis of the motion itself, in the form of vibration signals acquired
by the Turbine Condition Monitoring System (TCMS). The sampling time of TCM systems is of the
order of several Hz, but it can also reach the kHz scale. For example, in [ 13], gearbox vibration
data having a 40-Hz frequency are studied. They are collected at the test facility of NREL and are
down-sampled to 10 Hz in order to reproduce the most common reality in the industry; component
failure identiﬁcation and monitoring gearbox high-speed stage vibration are addressed, and four
different data-driven models are developed. The shortcoming of this study is that the drive-train
was ﬁxed to the ﬂoor, and so, the relation with the tower and, most of all, with realistic wind ﬂow
was disregarded. Dealing with vibration signals for condition monitoring issues, the main point
as regards wind turbines is decomposing the non-stationarity induced by the nature of the wind.
In [14], a method is proposed combining Ensemble Intrinsic Time-scale Decomposition (EITD) and
the Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) fractal dimension. This is employed for decomposing vibration
signals into several proper rotation components, and it is shown that this is capable of appreciable
early fault diagnosis. In [ 15], a method for extracting the fault feature of the wind turbine bearing is
proposed, based on Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and the Teager Energy Operator (TEO).
The method is validated by simulation and experimental signal analysis results, and the authors claim it
is superior with respect to empirical mode decomposition and conventional spectrum analysis. In [ 16],
the objective is separating bearing fault signals from drive-train motion signals, and the proposed
method is cepstral editing. The method is validated on experimental data from NREL. In [ 17], feature
extraction is tackled by analyzing statistical features measuring the signal energy and Gaussianity
from the residual signals between each pair from the ﬁrst to the ﬁfth tooth mesh frequency of the
meshing process in a multi-stage wind turbine gearbox.
This survey of the literature pointed at supporting one reasonable observation: many contributions
to the wind energy scientiﬁc literature are devoted to the analysis of wind ﬂow at the microscale
level (including at least the most straightforward interaction with the turbine: wakes), and many
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

contributions are devoted to the most advanced mechanical aspects of wind turbine functioning.
However, the connection between these two main topics is still somehow in the early stages, since
it is a very challenging task. Very recently, some ﬁrst developments, mainly focused on blade loads,
have been obtained. In [ 18], short-term load measurements from a Vestas V66 wind turbine located in
Germany are employed for estimating the effect of wakes on fatigue damage and on expected lifetime.
In [19], fatigue load prediction is attempted using SCADA data and artiﬁcial neural network techniques.
Attention is focused on blade bending moments, and it is reported that the proposed method provides
an average error between simulations and measurements of the order of 1.5%. In [ 20], active control of
wind turbine yawing is addressed in order to mitigate power losses and mechanical loads induced by
wake interactions. This is achieved using a computational framework consisting of an aerodynamic
model for wind farm wake, a blade-element-momentum model to compute the power and the loads
and a gradient-based optimizer. An example of scientiﬁc contribution moving towards a real wind to
gear perspective is [ 21]: the dynamic characteristics of the wind turbine gearbox under random wind
excitations are studied. By using the Chebyshev inclusion function and the Welch method, an interval
method for predicting the interval bounds of power spectral density for system responses is proposed.
Further, in [ 22], a model of the load of the wind turbine gears for the simulation of real operational
conditions is developed. Wind speed is simulated as a time series approximated by the Weierstrass
function, and the rotational speed of the main shaft is consequently modeled. It is shown that the
model ﬁts nicely with experimental data, and this is claimed to be an important development for
understanding how the loading of the drive-train, and therefore, its long-term damage, works.
The scientiﬁc motivations of this work are based on this discussion. A cluster of four wind
turbines, having 2.3 MW of rated power each, is studied because it is sited in a very complex terrain.
In previous works, as for example [ 23], it is shown that wakes between nearby turbines and effects
induced by the terrain conspire in a complex way, resulting in a directional distortion of the wakes and
a disruption of the wake front while proceeding downstream. This leads to a faster wake recovery
with respect to what would happen in ﬂat terrain, as can be estimated also through CFD simulations.
The question addressed in this work is therefore the following: Do the particular unsteady wind ﬂow
conditions of this terrain on this cluster resemble somehow the vibration spectra? This question can be
tackled because the wind turbines are instrumented with TCMS recording vibrations at the order of
kHz. Two sub-objectives are attempted: The ﬁrst one is analyzing tower structural vibrations, because
they are expected to be more sharply responsive to the features of the wind ﬂow and therefore to
wakes between nearby wind turbines and to terrain effects. The second objective is the analysis of
vibration spectra at the drive-train. This is further motivated by the fact that the drive-train acts as a
velocity multiplier, and therefore, it might be very valuable for studying wind turbine wakes at rated
power, when manifest symptoms (as power collapse) fade away.
The structure of the paper is the following: in Section 2, the test case and the dataset are
described; the methods are introduced in Section 3; the results are collected and discussed in Section 4;
the conclusions are ﬁnally drawn in Section 5.
2. The Test Case and the Dataset
The wind farm selected for this study is made of 17 turbines. Each of them has a rated power of
2.3 MW. The hub height is 80 m, and the rotor diameter is 93 m. The layout of the wind farm is vast and
sited in a very complex terrain: even the comprehension of the free wind flow in this site is challenging.
For the purposes of this study , a cluster of four wind turbines is selected. The turbine layout is sketched
in Figure 1 with a three-dimensional view that allows one to appreciate the impressive complexity of
the terrain.

turbines are labelled with their names: SGM10, SGM11, SGM12 and SGM13. The terrain is represented

The turbine layout is represented also by means of a two-dimensional view in Figure 2, highlighting
the inter-turbine distances.

for the couple of turbines SGM10 and SGM11 (see Figure 1), the resulting amplitude of the wake sector
is69.95, and it is centered on the angle of the straight line connecting the two wind turbines: its value,
as computed from wind turbine coordinate positions, is 279.69. See Figure 2.
The dataset employed for the analysis is constituted of vibration time series acquired by the
TCMS. The vibration measurements are provided by seven industrial accelerometers, type GJ1200M8,
which are designed for harsh environments. The sensors are placed both on the wind turbine tower
and on several critical points of the drive-line. The structural accelerations are recorded through a
bi-axial sensor placed on the top of the tower while the drive-line vibrations are measured by means of
six mono-axial accelerometers placed on several points of the drive-line housing. Table 1 summarizes
the overall accelerometer layout. In this work, particular attention has been devoted to main bearing
vibrations. For the sake of clarity, the main bearing is the bearing on which the rotor hub rotates.
The schematic of the drive-line is shown in Figure 3. The wind turbine gearbox is a speed multiplier

having a transmission ratio of 91, 137 and is constituted of three stages: an epicyclic stage and two
ordinary stages. The position of the main bearing accelerometer is highlighted by the black arrow.
All the vibration signals of the main bearing have been acquired with a sampling frequency of 2557.5
Hz and a time length of 25 s. Note that the on-board acquisition system collects data only to a rated
power of 2.3 MW, which corresponds to an average speed of the generator shaft of 1450 rpm.

As a support for interpreting the possible wake regime that the wind turbines might be undergoing
when vibrations’ time series are recorded, further sources of information are employed. The TCMS
provides also the average value of the meteorological conditions and the main working parameters
(e.g., wind speed, nacelle positions, pitch angle, rotor revolutions per minute, and so on). Note that the
term “average value” refers to quantities without frequency content, but stored just as a mean value
over a certain time interval.
In Figure 1, an arrow indicates the main wind direction regime analyzed in this work: wind
blowing from the west. Previous studies support this choice as interesting to study. For instance, in [ 23],
it is shown that the wake of the upstream SGM10 wind turbine is directionally distorted by the terrain,
and for example, when SGM10 orientates at 270, SGM11 tends to orient at 260. This shift, as well as
orography singularities encountered while proceeding downstream explain the faster wake recovery
along the cluster, with respect to what would happen in ﬂat terrain. Furthermore, from [ 23], it also
arises that the relative importance of wind turbine wakes and terrain-induced complex ﬂow depends
on wind speed regime. On these grounds and crosschecking against Equation (1), SGM11 nacelle
orientation around 250and 260(see Tables 3 and 4) is a very interesting regime to study. The above
information about mutual wake effects among wind turbines and about the interaction between wind
turbines and terrain suggests that investigating turbines under the same external wind ﬂow conditions
could lead to interesting results and considerations. In order to do this, careful data mining must be
performed because the vibration time series of each wind turbine is collected independently. In order
to investigate the mutual interactions among different wind turbines subjected to turbulent ﬂows,
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2017 ,10, 1839 6 of 19
it is pivotal to analyze vibration signals recorded synchronously or in a very short time window.
Furthermore, it is interesting to study wind turbines working at rated power, since power collapse
symptoms fade away and also the macroscopic response of wind turbines (in the form of working
parameters) should be dominated by the free ﬂow (i.e., by the terrain). Therefore, one interesting
question is if the gearbox, acting as a velocity multiplier, can somehow trace the different wake regimes
and how they can be detected. Another interesting issue is what can be observed through the structural
vibrations analysis about the combination of wakes and terrain effects. These questions are addressed
in the following sections.
3. Experimental and Numerical Methods
3.1. Tower Vibration Analysis
The TCMS records the structural accelerations through a bi-axial sensor placed on the top of the
tower. In this way, both the fore-aft and lateral accelerations can be measured on a plane parallel to
the ground. As regards tower oscillations, the Root Mean Square (RMS) of the signal is analyzed as a
function of the yaw position. For the purpose of this study, the RMS is a meaningful metric because
it describes the overall (root) energy of vibration signals that reﬂects the global structural vibration
of the tower. The yaw position is a meaningful SCADA measurement for the purpose of this work,
because, on the grounds of considerations similar to those in [ 23], it can easily be put in relation to the
wake regime described by Equation (1).
3.2. Gearbox Vibration Analysis
It is reasonable to suppose that the turbulent flows cause an abnormal change of the rotational
speed. Thus, the study of drive-line speed variations could be pivotal in order to detect and investigate
the wake effects on a wind turbine sub-cluster. Unfortunately, the TCMS does not provide a direct
measure of the instantaneous speed of any drive-line shaft. However, the vibration signals can be
exploited for extracting the gear speed variations by means of a dedicated signal processing procedure.
In this work, the planet carrier speed has been extracted from the main bearing vibration signal by using
the method proposed in [ 25], which is based on the Hilbert transform. Then, the variation severity of
the extracted speed has been quantified by means of a scalar index, called the Crest Factor (CF) [ 26].
The aforementioned approach has been performed on two different datasets. The ﬁrst dataset is
constituted of eleven Time Series (TS) referenced to SGM11 recorded at different times with different
average nacelle orientations. The objective, in this case, is highlighting possible peculiarities of the
SGM11 wind turbine operating under the wake of upstream SGM10, in terms of vibration spectra and
drive-line speed ﬂuctuations. Eventually, the link between phase ﬂuctuations and turbulent ﬂows has
been further investigated by analyzing the residual signal [ 27] of the planetary annulus gear, which
exhibits marked modulation phenomena likely caused by the wake effect.
The second dataset is composed of seven TSs recorded in a time interval of less than ten
minutes (see Table 4), during which the ﬂow conditions have been considered as reasonably constant,
considering all the available turbines of the subcluster. In this case, the goal is inquiring if and how
the differences of external wind ﬂows, induced by the wake interactions, resemble differences in the
extracted instantaneous speed of the wind turbine drive-line in terms of CF values.
3.3. The CFD Model
As a support for the interpretation of the vibration spectra and their relation with the working
parameters of the wind turbine (as for example yaw position), a free ﬂow CFD simulation is performed,
using the WindSim numerical tool [ 28,29] and adopting the Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS)
approach. Despite that in general, the complexity of the terrain and the interplay with wind turbine
wakes call for more advanced approaches as for example Large-Eddy Simulations (LES), their use
for simulation of full-scale wind turbines in real complex terrain is in the early stages [ 30]. RANS is
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2017 ,10, 1839 7 of 19
nowadays still a widely-employed approach [ 31,32] even in complex terrain, despite its well-known
limitations caused by the steadiness assumption.
The details about the model are reported in the following Table 2, where xis the north-south
direction, yis the east-west direction and zis the vertical coordinate. The computational grid is
reported in Figure 4, where on the left, there is the x ygrid and on the right the z grid.

reﬁnement around the turbine area and near the terrain boundary.
Laterally, due to the Cartesian grid, there are two frictionless walls and one inlet and one outlet
for the orthogonal sectors and two inlets and two outlets for the skewed sectors. For the ground,
there is a wall function for fully-rough regimes developed by the code provider. The complex terrain is
handled using the body-ﬁtted coordinates in order to consider the terrain boundary layer. The wind
at the inlet is a logarithmic proﬁle according to the roughness length (approximately of the order of
0.003). As indicated in Table 2, the selected turbulence model is RNG (Re-Normalisation Group) k- e.
According to some studies in the literature [ 33], this is a good choice for simulating ﬂow in complex
terrain. In [ 34], the performances of different turbulence models are compared in idealized and real
terrains: in particular, for the terrain of Askervein Hill, it arises that, similarly to the idealized cases,
RNG k- eis a good choice. The rationale for the use of this CFD model is observing what information
is provided from the free ﬂow about the distribution of turbulence intensity at hub height, induced
by terrain and roughness. As discussed in [ 35], in order to precisely estimate the turbulence intensity
from CFD models, it is important to take into account the roughness properly and, in this very complex
case, especially the terrain.

The data are grouped by the TCMS in intervals of power with respect to the rated power: for this
reason, Figure 5 refers to the range of 75% of rated power, and Figure 6 refers to the rated power regime.
In Figures 5 and 6, the normalized RMS is plotted against the average nacelle position measured
during the time interval of vibration recording.
Figure 5. Normalized root mean square of tower vibrations vs. nacelle position (75% rated power).
In Figure 5, there are several peaks of normalized RMS as regards turbine SGM11 when the nacelle
is oriented at around 260. As discussed in [ 23] and hinted at in Section 3, the nacelle orientation at
260is the typical conﬁguration of SGM11 as a response to the wake of turbine SGM10 when the wind
blows from the west. This picture, therefore, supports the idea that the turbulence induced by the
wake can be observed through the structural vibrations. The situation is somehow reversed when
dealing with the rated power regime (Figure 6). The most evident peaks now regard turbine SGM13,
and they thicken around 240. Following a SCADA data ﬁltering procedure, analogous to the one
in [23] on the same dataset of two years of measurements, it arises that when SGM13 is oriented at
240and is producing rated power, the nacelle of SGM10 is on average oriented at 252. The SGM10
yaw position at 252indicates, on the grounds of Equation (1), a partial wake hitting the rest of the
cluster. Further, the 240direction sector is peculiar because it is characterized by the highest terrain
complexity along the cluster: this point has been discussed, for example, in [ 36], where the complexity
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2017 ,10, 1839 9 of 19
of the terrain has been quantiﬁed through the RIX values (Ruggedness Index) [ 37,38] computed at a
given point through the Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program as the fractional extent of the
surrounding terrain, which is steeper than a certain critical slope. In particular, at the site of SGM13,
the directional RIX at 240is the highest, and it is 50% higher than the average non-directional RIX.
On these grounds, the thrust regime (weaker at rated power), the partial rather than full wake regime
and the RIX values support that the peaks of RMS of the SGM13 tower vibrations in Figure 6 are due
to the ﬂow acceleration induced by the terrain.
Figure 6. Normalized root mean square of tower vibrations vs. nacelle position (rated power).
Therefore, summarizing, the plots of Figures 5 and 6 allow highlighting, with a structural vibration
viewpoint, the most important phenomena characterizing the cluster of interest, depending on the
regime of interest: wake on SGM11 at medium-high powers and terrain effects at rated power.
4.2. CFD
In Figure 7, the simulated wind speed and pressure fields at hub height are reported on the whole
computational domain. Three wind direction sectors have been selected, for brevity: 30,60and 270.
These three sectors have been selected according to the wind direction measured when the experimental
vibration time series here on analyzed have been collected (see Figure 8). From SCADA data analysis,
it arises that these sectors occur respectively 13.5%, 8% and 20.5% of the time. Looking at the contours
reported in Figure 7, it is clear that the simulated field conditions lead to wind speed on the rotor for
rated power production; also, some differences in the inflow conditions for each position arise.
The picture arising from the results collected in the previous subsection is supported by the
following analysis, focused on turbine SGM11 and concerning the crosscheck against the numerical
model. The procedure is as follows. The TCMS keeps stored a certain number of the latest tower
vibration time series in their raw form, only at rated power. The frequency of the acquisition is 40 Hz,
and the time series are long more than 6 min. These have been analyzed, post-processed using a
band-pass ﬁlter in the [0.1, 2]Hz interval, and the normalized RMS has been computed. The numerical
model has been employed for computing the turbulence intensity at hub height. For each average
nacelle position of each time series, the turbulence intensity is extrapolated at the corresponding
direction at the site of the SGM11 wind turbine. These two quantities (RMS and turbulence intensity)
are juxtaposed in Figure 8.

TI (turbulence intensity) extrapolated at the corresponding wind direction (blue scale) at the site
of SGM11.
From Figure 8, it arises that the turbulence intensity of the free ﬂow increases approaching
260. The behavior is similar as regards the normalized RMS . This can be considered a qualitative
result supporting that, at rated power, the behavior of the free ﬂow (and therefore, the importance
of the terrain) is fundamental in order to understand structural vibrations. The deﬁnitive crosscheck
would be simulating the free ﬂow and the wind turbines together, for example using the actuator disc
approach as in [ 23], and comparing the values and distribution of turbulence intensity. Unfortunately,
the employed model allows one only to consider orthogonal disc orientations, and the behavior in
Figure 8 therefore cannot be reproduced accounting also for the presence of wind turbines.
4.3. Main Bearing
The wake effect of turbine SGM10 on the rest of the cluster is now investigated from two different
standpoints. The ﬁrst one concerns the vibration analysis of the gearbox of turbine SGM11 in terms
of the instantaneous speed variation, as well as the annulus gear vibration. This analysis concerns
the use of eleven time series (TS1 to TS11), devoted only to wind turbine SGM11. Some details of the
working parameters during the acquisitions are reported in Table 3. The second approach is the study
of the interactions of SGM10, SGM11, SGM12 and SGM13 by comparing their instantaneous speed
variations. Since the acquisition system does not allow the synchronous measurements of different
turbines, the available dataset has been carefully inspected in search of a (small) time window where
the main bearing vibrations have been recorded in all the wind turbines. More details about the related
time series (TS12 to TS18) can be found in Table 4. As regards TS12 to TS18, data have been also
selected taking into account a yaw position around 260, in particular of the SGM11 wind turbine.
This position is interesting to study because it is a typical conﬁguration characterized by the wake
effect, or better, by the combination of the wake effect and terrain-induced effects [ 23] of SGM10 on the
rest of the cluster. An example of some raw vibration signals acquired on the main bearing is given in
Figure 9. For the sake of clarity, Table 5 collects the meshing frequencies of the gearbox referenced to a
generator speed of 1445.8 rpm.

The RMS values of the main bearing are reported in Figure 10. The trend of the RMS values does
not reveal any information about the wake effect on SGM11. Indeed, the RMS related to TS5 (which is

of the wake sector, Equation (1)) is at the same level of the other RMS values. This preliminary result
points out that RMS is not a good indicator to possibly capture the information about the turbulent
ﬂow phenomena due to the wake effect.

However, useful information can be deduced by extracting the instantaneous phase of the
planetary gear from the vibration signals. By looking at the spectra represented in Figure 11, the high
level components correspond to the gear mesh frequencies. Again, no signiﬁcant remarks can be
made by comparing such components in terms of amplitudes. Moreover, it should be noted that the
periodic components related to the meshing gears are not concentrated in a precise frequency bin,
but they spread around small frequency ranges centered in the corresponding gear mesh frequencies
(see Figure 11b). This behavior is due to ﬂuctuations of the rotational speed, which is not surprising
since wind turbines generally operate in non-stationary conditions. However, the turbulent ﬂows
should induce a general rise of the shaft speed variations. Thus, the study of the instantaneous speed
of the drive-train should lead to interesting implications about the wake effect. By virtue of these
considerations, the comparison of phase variations is addressed hereafter since the speed variations
could be meaningful for the quantiﬁcation of the wake effect.

Commonly, speed variations are investigated by means of the measured speeds by using
dedicated tachometers. Unfortunately, since the tachometer signal is not available in the provided
dataset, the instantaneous phase must be estimated indirectly from a vibration signal. In detail,
the instantaneous phase of the shaft can be extracted from the spectral information given by the
meshing components.
In this work, the instantaneous phase extracted from the main vibration signal and referenced to
the planetary gear is computed following the method presented in [ 25]. Brieﬂy, the method involves
the use of the Hilbert transform for the estimation of the analytic signal [ 39]. The analytic signal is a
complex signal where the imaginary part refers to the instantaneous phase, while the real part refers to
the envelope. A deﬁnition of analytic signal is given by the following equation:
xa(t) =x(t) +i˜x(t) (4)
where iis the imaginary unit, x(t)is the time signal and ˜x(t)is the Hilbert transform of x(t). Thus,
Equation (4) evaluated on a ﬁltered signal around a meshing frequency fmbecomes:
xa(t) =Xn(t)ei(2pfmt+fn(t))(5)
where Xn(t)is the amplitude of the n-th meshing component and fn(t)is the phase angle of the n-th
meshing component. The degree of phase ﬂuctuation due to the turbulent ﬂow has been quantiﬁed by
means the CF. The CF is a general scalar measure of a waveform, which is deﬁned as the ratio between
the maximum of a given time series and its RMS value:
CF=maxjs(t)j
RMS (s(t))(6)
where s(t)is an arbitrary time series. From the physical standpoint, the CF of the instantaneous phase
reﬂects the severity of the planet carrier speed variation. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the
greater the ﬂow turbulence (due to the wake effect), the greater is the CF value.
Finally, the following procedure has been adopted:
Step 1: the (very) low frequency components have been removed by using a high-pass ﬁlter;
Step 2: three gear mesh harmonics have been separately ﬁltered by means of a band-pass ﬁlter and
considering eight sidebands (four each side);
Step 3: the instantaneous phase is computed for each ﬁltered gear mesh component by means of the
Hilbert transform;
Step 4: the overall CF is computed by taking the sum of the individual CFs estimated from each
ﬁltered gear mesh component.
Note that Step 1 is a pre-processing step for the removal of low frequency components unrelated
to the phenomena of interest.
As reported in Figure 12, computing the overall CF of the same TSs used in Figure 10, it can be
seen that the maximum value corresponds to TS5, as expected. This result conﬁrms that the turbulent
ﬂow induces a prominent change in the rotational speed of the turbine gearbox, with speciﬁc reference
to the planet carrier shaft.
It is a matter of fact [ 27] that speed ﬂuctuations in gearboxes take the form of sidebands around the
meshing frequency in the frequency spectrum. In order to make a clearer representation of the results
reported in Figure 12, the Time Synchronous Average (TSA) [ 40] of the vibration signal referenced
to the planetary annulus gear has been computed. Then, the residual signal has been estimated by
removing the fundamental gear mesh component and its harmonics. The resulting signal is a signal
that owns mainly the amplitude/phase modulations, which comprise the information of interest.
As done previously, the CF has been computed on the residual signal, and the results are reported in

A further conﬁrmation of this behavior is given by some results on the TS12 to TS18 time series
(Figure 14), thus switching to the approach of observing as simultaneously as possible the vibrations
of the wind turbines under a regime that is associated to the wake of SGM10 on the rest of the
subcluster [23]. The details of the time series employed for this analysis are reported in Table 4.
The recording time has been included in order to show that this dataset regards the vibration
signals acquired in a limited time window in which all the turbines are oriented in a wake conﬁguration.
Further, a crosscheck against the SCADA dataset is useful: the standard deviation on a 10-min basis of
the data is available. It results that, during each of the 10-min intervals containing the time stamps in
Table 4, the standard deviation of the nacelle position of each turbine is of the order of 2.5. Therefore,
it is completely reasonable to juxtapose the time series of Table 4 to compare their properties, because
they are collected during time intervals displaying very similar ﬂow regimes.
As regards Figure 14, it is immediately clear that, in all the considered datasets, the degree of phase
ﬂuctuation of SGM11 is higher than the one of SGM10. This observation is in complete agreement with
the previous results. Some other considerations can be drawn by observing the results of SGM12 and
SGM13. Assuming (on the grounds of the arguments in [ 23]) that the wake effect should be maximum
for SGM11, the vibrational behavior of the other turbines should be a compromise between SGM10 and
SGM11. Moreover, the wake effect should become more and more random according to the number
of the turbines in series. The results conﬁrm this hypothesis since the overall CF of SGM13 and the
average results of SGM12, namely TS15 and TS17, are collocated in between the results of SGM10 and
SGM11. Note also that the yaw position angle is according to the angular position typical of a wake
conﬁguration, as supported by experimental data in Section 4.1.

Eventually, this investigation using the main bearing vibration signals has highlighted that the
wake effect is detectable also by means of gearbox vibration analysis (with speciﬁc reference to the
main bearing). This approach involves a more complex signal processing treatment with respect to the
tower structural vibrations analysis, but allows for a deeper insight about the link between the nacelle
vibrations and the turbulent ﬂows. Despite the restrictions of the acquisition system, the available
data have shown consistent results with respect to the previous work on the topic, as well as the
assumptions made.
5. Conclusions
This work has been devoted to the study of tower and structural vibrations of four full-scale wind
turbines operating in a very complex terrain. The analysis of experimental vibration data has been
empowered by the analysis of the SCADA data of the wind turbines and by a CFD model of the wind
ﬂow over the terrain.
The test case has been selected because it is characterized by a peculiar combination of wake
effects between nearby turbines and terrain-induced ﬂow acceleration, as discussed in previous papers
from the authors (especially [23]).
The main question that this work aimed to answer is: Based on the knowledge of the wind
ﬂow at this site and of the operating behavior of the wind turbines, is it possible to see that the
particular unsteady conditions, which are due to the mixing of wakes and complex ﬂow, resemble
the vibration spectra? The answer is yes, and further, the methods proposed in this work are general
and can be expected to work for any test case. The main ﬁndings of this work are therefore the
following: as regards structural vibrations, the analysis of their normalized RMS as a function of wind
turbine nacelle position at different power regimes gives an indication of the relative importance of
wakes and terrain effects. The effect of wakes is more clearly visible at medium-high powers, and that
of terrain is better highlighted at rated power.
Concerning the drive-train vibrations, the research has focused on the main bearing vibration
signal. Two different aspects have been addressed: the ﬁrst one is the vibrational behavior of the wind
turbine being more involved with the wake effect (SGM11) of the upstream SGM10; the second one
regards the interactions due to the wake effect on the whole cluster, as observed at the closest possible
times available in the dataset. A total of 18 TSs has been considered, demonstrating a consistent link
between the turbulent ﬂows and the speed variations of the drive-line. As expected, the greater the
wake effect, the greater the speed ﬂuctuations. Moreover, the wake effect becomes more stochastic
and less severe for the furthest wind turbines (SGM12 and SGM13). These results support the picture
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

of the wake recovery along the cluster that has been proposed in [ 23]. It is further interesting that
this kind of analysis, exploiting the fact that the drive-train acts as a velocity multiplier, allows one
to detect symptoms of wake effects at rated power (all the TSs analyzed in this work are collected at
rated power; see Tables 3 and 4), when the most manifest symptoms are not visible.
As discussed also in Section 1, impressive achievements have been obtained in vibration analysis
for condition monitoring and early fault diagnosis of the gearbox of wind turbines. These methods,
however, usually consider the gearbox by itself: actually, the main technical issue is exactly cleaning
the signal from the unsteadiness induced by the varying ﬂow. The approach of this work is
somehow opposite: employing the techniques of non-stationary vibration signal analysis for building
a connection with the wind ﬂow. This kind of information about loads, stresses, possible long-term
degradation of drive-train components under peculiar regimes, as wake or complex ﬂow, could be
used for wind farm optimization, for individuating advantageous sector management with the aim
of wake mitigation, and so on. This task has been recently attracting much interest in the scientiﬁc
community dealing with wind energy: the expected lifetime of a component is gradually becoming
a parameter depending on the history of the operation of a wind turbine, rather than an estimate
provided at the design phase. This connects the present work to an important future development:
the analysis and modeling of fatigue loads [ 41,42]. In the perspective that in the future, it could be
possible to formulate and connect careful modelings of the rotor, drive-train and wind ﬁeld for wake
and non-waked operation, in order to build a theoretical framework from wind to gear and from gear
to wind, it is certainly valuable to start from the experimental evidence, as has been done in this work.
