Abstract: In recent years, the demand and requirement for renewable energy have signiﬁcantly
increased due to concerns regarding energy security and the climate crisis. This has led to a signiﬁcant
focus on wind power generation. As the deployment of wind turbines continues to rise, there
is a growing need to assess their lifespan and improve their stability. Access to accurate load
data is crucial for enhancing safety and conducting remaining life assessments of wind turbines.
However, maintaining and ensuring the reliability of measurement systems for long-term load data
accumulation, stability assessments, and residual life evaluations can be challenging. As a result,
numerous studies have been conducted on load prediction for wind turbines. However, existing
load prediction models based on 10 min statistical data cannot adequately capture the short-term
load variations experienced by wind turbines. Therefore, it is essential to develop models capable of
predicting load with a high temporal resolution to enhance reliability, especially with the increasing
scale and development of ﬂoating wind turbines. In this paper, we developed prediction models
with a 50 Hz resolution for the bending strain at the tower bottom of offshore wind turbines by
combining SCADA data and acceleration data using machine learning techniques and analyzed the
results. The load prediction models demonstrated high accuracy, with a mean absolute percentage
error below 4%.

1. Introduction
The demand for wind energy has signiﬁcantly increased in recent years due to concerns
regarding energy security and the global climate crisis. According to statistics from the
International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the global capacity for wind power
generation has experienced rapid growth, increasing from around 180 GW in 2010 to
approximately 824 GW in 2022 [ 1]. Wind power generation can be broadly classiﬁed into
onshore and offshore wind power. While the majority of wind power installations have
traditionally been located on land, the development of large-scale onshore wind farms
has faced various challenges. These include limitations in ﬁnding suitable land areas for
installation, concerns about environmental impact and ecosystem disruption, as well as
noise complaints from nearby communities. To address these challenges, offshore wind
power generation is garnering attention as a potential solution. Additionally, offshore
wind power generation allows for stable power production due to its relatively consistent
wind conditions.
Offshore wind turbines (OWTs) are exposed to not only wind loads but also complex
and diverse environmental loads, such as waves and ocean currents. It can cause variability
in the performance of power generation and the turbines’ lifetime compared to onshore
turbines. A signiﬁcant proportion of accidents involving OWTs are caused by excessive

loads on the towers leading to instability, damage, or collapse of the structures [ 2]. There-
fore, continuous load monitoring for the operation and maintenance of OWTs is essential
to enhance their stability, and ensure customer proﬁts throughout their life cycle [3,4].
Generally, in order to evaluate the tower stability or lifespan of an offshore wind
turbine, the strain of the tower is measured, converted into a load, and then analyzed.
The strain of the tower is measured simultaneously with the operational conditions of the
turbine and is used to estimate the damage equivalent load (DEL) for each wind speed
bin. This DEL can then be applied to life evaluation according to the statistical wind model.
However, strain is typically measured through a bridge composed of a strain gage. During
this process, the bridge attached to the tower can be contaminated or damaged by static
electricity or lightning strikes that occur along the tower.
Wind turbines have a SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) system that
measures data needed for power generation and management control. In addition, a condi-
tion monitoring system (CMS) can be installed on the drive train, with various vibration
sensors installed to monitor its condition. But, CMS often experiences signiﬁcant failures.
While the SCADA system is widely recognized as an essential system, implementing the
CMS comes with additional expenses and effort for long-term operation and management
as it requires additional data acquisition systems. However, unlike onshore cases, OWTs
are relatively difﬁcult to access, and reducing the number of visits is cost-effective and
safer for personnel. Therefore, it is essential to have technology that can extract various
indicators for wind turbine heal and management based on a minimal additional system to
adequately achieve LCOE through reasonable access to O&M.
Choi et al. [ 5] developed a fatigue load prediction algorithm for offshore wind turbines
using polynomial curve ﬁtting, decision trees, regular linear regression, and artiﬁcial
neural network techniques. They demonstrated that fatigue load prediction using machine
learning is superior to the statistical polynomial curve ﬁtting method.
Noppe, N. et al. [ 6] employed an artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) to forecast the
damage equivalent load (DEL) of the fore-aft bending moment at the base of the wind
turbine tower. Their study demonstrated that partitioning the dataset based on operational
modes, speciﬁcally standstill, partial load, and full load, enhances the accuracy of the
predictions. Among the various feature selection methods investigated, neighborhood
components analysis (NCA) exhibited excellent performance in DEL prediction while
utilizing the smallest set of features.
A physically informed machine learning approach was applied with a custom loss
function (Minkowski logarithmic error) to predict the DEL of a wind turbine tower
(Santos, F. et al. [ 7]). By comparing the accumulated fatigue load at the transition piece
interface of three wind turbines with predictions, they demonstrated that the physically
informed model estimated the accumulated damage equivalent moment with an error of
less than 3%.
Luis Vera-Tudela et al. [ 8] proposed a metric to predict fatigue load and evaluate
the quality of fatigue load prediction for two wind turbines within a wind farm. They
evaluated the quality of fatigue damage prediction in the edgewise and ﬂapwise directions
of the blades under six different ﬂow conditions for two wind turbines within the wind
farm. Although the accuracy decreased somewhat under wake ﬂow conditions, they show
that a reasonable monitoring system can be established based on a neural network model
regardless of ﬂow condition differentiation.
Cosack and his colleagues [ 9] proposed a comprehensive methodology to predict load
using the standard wind turbine control signal of wind turbines with an ANN.
Francisco d Santos et al. [ 10] implemented a methodology to determine the DEL of
the bending moment for an OWT tower installed on Jacket-foundation using an artiﬁcial
neural network. They developed the model using practical wind turbine data, indicating
its applicability to other turbines via cross-validation. They also showed that not only
SCADA signals but also accelerometer sensor signals increase the prediction accuracy of
the bending moment DEL of the Jacket-foundation OWT tower.

In most approaches, load prediction models rely on statistical data collected at 10 min
intervals, which may not capture the short-term variability of the loads experienced by the
turbines. To address this limitation, recent research has explored the use of SCADA data
and acceleration data to develop bending strain prediction models that can capture the
behavior of the turbines.
SCADA systems are used to monitor and control the operation of offshore wind tur-
bines. The system collects real-time data on various parameters, such as wind speed, blade
pitch angle, and power output. The loads experienced by various turbine components can
be effectively estimated through bending strain prediction models using the SCADA data.
Acceleration data offer insights into how the turbine components dynamically respond
to environmental loads. By utilizing accelerometers placed on the turbine tower, the
acceleration data can be measured. This data can then be utilized to create prediction
models for bending strain, enabling to capture the turbine’s short-term load variability.
In this paper, we developed prediction models with a 50 Hz resolution for the bending
strain at the tower bottom of OWTs by combining SCADA data and acceleration data
using the machine learning technique. Firstly, we collected the necessary data from the
SCADA and CMS systems, ensuring that they were synchronized during the data collection.
Secondly, we applied a low-pass ﬁlter to the collected data and resampled it to a target
frequency of 50 Hz. Thirdly, we developed a prediction model using various machine
learning algorithms, including ANN, RNN, LSTM, and GRU, to predict the bending strain
of offshore wind turbine towers. We evaluated the accuracy of these models and found
that the LSTM algorithm outperformed the others in terms of prediction accuracy for the
bending strain.
Along with prediction, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is analyzed in detail:
(1) MAPE for each prediction; (2) MAPE along time history, and (3) wind speed for three
zones including idling (blade pitching to 0 deg.), run-up (blade rotating without generator
torque) and normal operation (power production).
Section 2 will provide further details about the measurement campaign. In Section 3,
the machine learning theory, characteristics of the training dataset, and the preprocessing
steps for predicting the bending strain at a temporal resolution of 50 Hz are discussed.
Section 4 presents and analyzes the results of the bending strain prediction. Finally, Section 5
concludes the paper.
2. Measurement Campaign
Figure 1a shows the target offshore wind turbine and conﬁguration of strain gauges as
a full bridge for measuring the bending strain. A data acquisition system (DAS) is installed
in offshore wind turbine with a suction bucket foundation. The OWT has a rated power
of 4.2 MW at a wind speed of 11.3 m/s. Two 3-axis accelerometers have spectral range of
0~2.4 kHz with 10% error and locate to measure acceleration at the tower top and bottom
with sampling rates of 1.5 kHz. Both accelerometers are positioned by a magnetic base
with additional epoxy bonding. A 90-degree strain gauge as full-bridge conﬁguration
measures the bending strain at the tower bottom with 50 Hz sampling rates, as shown
in Figure 1b. Each SCADA data in this paper are acquired with 0.5 Hz sampling rates.
All of the quantity measured and acquired is synchronized at the start of measurement.
The motivation for each measurement is that (1) accelerations of higher sampling rates
can characterize short-term time series, (2) SCADA with lower sampling rates affect the
long-term behavior of time response, and (3) bending measurement synchronized with
other measurements is for veriﬁcation of predictions.

3. Data Description and Methodology
In order to predict the bending strain of a wind turbine tower, a machine learning
model was employed. As mentioned in the introduction, machine learning has been widely
used in various studies [ 11–14], with notable models including ANN, recurrent neural
networks (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU). In this
research, ANN, RNN, LSTM, and GRU models were utilized to predict the bending strain
of the wind turbine tower, considering its high temporal resolution. The obtained results
were compared and analyzed. The following provides a brief explanation of each machine
learning model.
3.1. Theory of Neural Networks
Deep learning, a ﬁeld of machine learning, is currently the subject of extensive re-
search due to its ability to address the problem of overﬁtting [ 15,16], its ability to increase
processing speed, and due to the development of data science technologies, such as big
data. ANNs form the foundation of deep learning algorithms and are composed of per-
ceptrons that imitate the information transmission mechanisms of neurons [17]. Typically,
the structure of ANNs consists of three layers: the input layer, the hidden layer, and the
output layer. Each layer’s weights are sequentially updated from the input layer through
the hidden layer to the output layer to minimize the error between predicted values and
actual values through a method known as feedforward neural network (FFNN) [ 18]. When
an ANN has two or more hidden layers, it is called a multilayer neural network [ 19], while
a network with more than two hidden layers is known as a deep neural network or deep
learning. Figure 2 depicts the typical structure of ANNs, and the mathematical formulation
is as follows [20].

where, wrepresents the parameter to be optimized, hrepresents the activation function and
a linear function ffor those in the output layer and subscript kis the number of perceptron

Rumelhart et al. (1986) [ 21], RNN is a type of deep neural network (DNN) that differs
from the primary FFNN, where activation signals only move from the input layer to
the output layer. Instead, RNN employs a parallel chain structure, connecting previous
neural network results to the current network’s learning process. This structure performs
excellently processing continuous data, such as time series data [ 22]. However, RNN is
highly dependent on the previous state, as the gradients in each output unit rely heavily
on the current state. When there are numerous neuron units or input units, the error

value can exponentially increase (gradient exploding) or rapidly converge to zero (gradient
vanishing) due to the weights being repeatedly multiplied through the learning capability
of the past. To address these drawbacks, the LSTM algorithm was proposed [23].

cell’s output ( ht 1) and the current input ( xt) to a sigmoid activation layer to obtain a value
between 0 and 1. This value is then multiplied element-wise with the current state to

Figure 5 illustrates the general structure of a GRU, which was developed as a solution
to address the limitations of initial recurrent neural networks (RNNs), similar to LSTM.
Unlike LSTM, which incorporates both a hidden state and a cell state vector, GRU is solely
composed of a hidden state vector. It performs computations on input data through the

The update gate, zt, controls the information ﬂow from the previous hidden state and

architecture, characterized by fewer gates and parameters compared to LSTM. This design
choice enables GRU to exhibit faster processing speed and improved performance during

The SCADA data were measured at a sampling rate of 0.5 Hz, while the acceleration
data were captured at 1500 Hz and the bending strain data at 500 Hz. In order to predict
the bending strain at a target frequency of 50 Hz, a re-sampling process was conducted
to harmonize the sampling rates of these different signals. The SCADA data underwent
up-sampling, while the bending strain and acceleration data were down-sampled, resulting
in a consistent sampling rate of 50 Hz for all datasets. Figure 6 illustrates the resampling
method. Linear interpolation was applied to the internal values of the resampling period
for up-sampling, and decimation was performed on the internal values for down-sampling.

For training purposes, this study utilized a total of 15,269,998 data points collected at

another set of 2,159,950 data points, encompassing a time span of 43,199 s (equivalent to
12 h), was employed. In general, the most inﬂuential environmental variables for wind
turbines are wind speed and direction [ 26]. The static and dynamic characteristics of wind
turbines in normal operating conditions strongly depends on wind speed and direction.
Therefore, a preliminary analysis of wind speed and wind direction information at the time
of data measurement is an essential prerequisite for improving the accuracy of predicting
the bending strain of the wind turbine tower.
In Figure 8, the wind speed histogram is illustrated in conjunction with the Weibull
probability density function. The wind speed is distributed with 0.2 m/s intervals. The
most frequent occurrence of wind speeds within the measurement range is observed at
2.4 m/s, while wind speeds exceeding 12 m/s are extremely rare. The Weibull distribution
parameters indicate a shape parameter of 2.27 and a scale parameter of 4.31.

The power performance of a wind turbine is considered one of the most crucial factors
among various indicators that represent the characteristics of the turbine. The operation of
a wind turbine is controlled based on the wind speed, ranging from stop state to generation
state (lager than cut-in speed, 3 m/s). The control of the wind turbine through its operation
state also inﬂuences the static and dynamic structural behaviors. To investigate the range

Generally, a correlation coefﬁcient of jCorr(x,y)j0.1is considered to indicate a weak
correlation. Therefore, in this study, if the coefﬁcient of either the east–west or north–south
bending strain exceeded 0.1, it was selected as a feature for training the model. Additionally,
the features (6) deviation of wind direction and nacelle position and (11) pitching angle
were included, despite having lower correlation coefﬁcients, due to their close association
with operational domain and mis-control of the wind turbine. Therefore, we selected a
total of 18 features, including 12 features of SCADA data and 2 3-axis accelerometer data,
to train the bending strain prediction model for wind turbine towers. In this study, the
accelerations of 1500 kHz and bending strains of 500 Hz were down-sampled to 50 Hz
for the prediction. Down-sampling was performed using a simple decimation method, as
depicted in Figure 6b. However, down-sampling through simple decimation can introduce
undesired noise signals, including aliasing. A low-pass ﬁlter (LPF) was applied to the raw
data prior to resampling to mitigate the generation of unwanted signals, such as aliasing.

where, nis the order of ﬁlter, wcis the cutoff frequency and G0is the gain at zero frequency.
The input and output data in the training have different units, as indicated in Table 1.
When data values have different ranges due to their respective units, it can lead to biased
learning. Therefore, in this study, we normalized the input and output data to reduce the
impact of dimension and increase cohesion between the data. We used a min–max scaler for
normalization. The normalization ( zi) and denormalization ( xi) equations are as follows:
zi=(xi min(x))/(max(x) min(x)) (14)
xi=zi(max(x) min(x))+min(x) (15)
where, zirepresents the normalized data, xrepresents the actual values, and xirepresents
thei-th actual value of the data.
To evaluate the performance of the model identiﬁcation, we used the following met-

The parameters manually selected in the machine learning model are referred to
as hyperparameters. In this study, hyperparameter optimization was conducted for the
machine learning model, speciﬁcally focusing on the cell size, batch size, and epochs.
Consequently, the optimization for the machine learning models used in this study was
conﬁgured as shown in Table 2.

The structure of the ANN model was adopted from the research by Wang, Z. et al. [ 28].
Furthermore, to minimize the loss function during model training, an optimizer is necessary,
hence, in this study, we employed the adaptive moment estimation algorithm, commonly
known as Adam, as the optimizer. The loss function was set to mean square error (MSE).
Additionally, the learning rate was set to 0.01.

4. Results and Discussion
Table 3 summarizes the prediction errors of the ANN, RNN, LSTM, and GRU machine
learning models for predicting the bending strain of wind turbine towers. The RNN model
exhibited the most signiﬁcant error in prediction, while the LSTM model demonstrated the
smallest prediction error. The GRU model also showed high accuracy in its predictions,
but the R2value was relatively lower than the LSTM model. This indicates that the GRU
model has relatively lower accuracy in predicting local variations compared to the LSTM
model. Among the machine learning algorithms, the LSTM algorithm exhibited the best
performance in predicting the bending strain of the towers. Therefore, the following
analysis focuses on the results predicted by the LSTM algorithm for the prediction.

In Figure 13, we illustrate the time history of the predicted and measured bending
strains of the wind turbine tower, along with the absolute percentage error (APE) for each
sample corresponding to 50 Hz. Figure 13a depicts the strain in the east–west direction,
while Figure 13b represents the strain in the north–south direction. The solid blue line
represents the measured values, the solid red line represents the predicted values, and
the solid black line represents the APE time history. Both results match well with the

response of the turbine in the stop state varying with wind speed is different from that in

the wind turbine. Those change in the response and impulsive load is considered as the

Figure 15 illustrates the APE of the prediction according to the wind speed bin. It
can be observed that most of the APE peaks are located in the wind speed range below
2 m/s. This range corresponds to the stop state with higher turbulent intensity. It is seen
that braking rotor and higher intensity can induce higher peaks of APE.

APE values in the wind speed range below 2 to 4 m/s are generally  higher than those

APE values in the wind speed range below 2 to 4 m/s are generally higher than
those in the wind speed range above 4 m/s. At this range, the turbine is in both stages
of run-up or generation state, where the generator is in free-torque at the run-up state.

Similar to the range below 2 m/s, the free-torque causes a change in dynamic response
of the wind turbine according to wind speed, and then it can induce higher APE than the
generation state. While the stop state includes the braking operation, both the run-up and
the generation states exclude the braking, resulting in a lower peak of APE than in the
stop state.
Figure 16 shows the box plots for the APE binned with a step of 1 m/s based on the
wind speed shown in Figure 15. The median and the inter-quartile range are positioned
within a very low range of errors. According to Figure 15, the error appears to decrease as
the wind speed increases. However, the pattern looks different when observed through
statistical distribution, as shown in Figure 16. According to Figure 16, as the wind speed
exceeds 6 m/s, both the median and the inter-quartile range (IQR) of the box plot show a
slight increase. It indicates that the error increases slightly for wind speeds exceeding 6 m/s.

5. Conclusions and Future Works
In this study, we predicted and analyzed the bending strain of wind turbine towers
with a temporal resolution of 50 Hz using data obtained from the SCADA and additional
measurements. Firstly, we acquired the necessary data for training from the SCADA and
additional systems, ensuring their synchronization upon acquisition. Secondly, resampling
is applied to the measured data after low-pass ﬁltering. Thirdly, machine learning tech-
niques to predict the offshore wind turbine tower’s bending strain are developed, where
machine learning algorithms included the ANN, RNN, LSTM, and GRU models.
In the analysis of the prediction results, the bending strain is compared with mea-
surement and accuracy is computed as APE. The results demonstrated that the LSTM
algorithm outperformed the others in terms of prediction accuracy for the wind turbine
tower’s bending strain.
However, it should be noted that higher prediction errors were observed in low wind
speed regions. This can be attributed to factors, such as high turbulent intensity during
strong winds and the impact of dynamic response change resulting from blade pitch control
and free-torque of a generator during the stop state and the run-up. Moreover, in the stop
state, the braking operation is considered as the main reason for the higher peak of APE in
the prediction of the strain. Despite this, our research presented the possibility of estimating
the remaining lifespan of wind turbines based on existing controller data and commonly
required CMS data without the additional long-term load measurement systems.
This approach allows for the utilization of a dataset with a higher temporal resolution,
offering various indicators for effective wind turbine management, such as DEL, spectral
response, and peak detection. Thus, the methodology and prediction procedure are key
innovations in our study. While many machine learning studies focus on accuracy in time
series prediction, it is essential to consider the operational conditions of wind turbines,
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

including stop, run-up, and generation states. Moreover, it is observed that lower prediction
accuracy during stop and run-up states can be attributed to factors like higher turbulent
intensity, rotor braking, and blade pitching in lower wind speed ranges. It is important to
note that the direct application of machine learning models to dynamic or static responses
can lead to incorrect results in speciﬁc wind speed ranges, despite satisfactory accuracy
in overall time series analysis. These ﬁndings provide valuable guidelines for integrating
machine learning into wind turbine analysis.
