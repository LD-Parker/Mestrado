Abstract. The rapid development of the wind industry in recent decades and the establishment of this tech-
nology as a mature and cost-competitive alternative have stressed the need for sophisticated maintenance and
monitoring methods. Structural health monitoring has risen as a diagnosis strategy to detect damage or failures
in wind turbine structures with the help of measuring sensors. The amount of data recorded by the structural
health monitoring system can potentially be used to obtain knowledge about the condition and remaining life-
time of wind turbines. Machine learning techniques provide the opportunity to extract this information, thereby
improving the reliability and cost-effectiveness of the wind industry as well. This paper demonstrates the mod-
elling of damage-equivalent loads of the fore–aft bending moments of a wind turbine tower, highlighting the
advantage of using the neighbourhood component analysis. This feature selection technique is compared to
common dimension reduction/feature selection techniques such as correlation analysis, stepwise regression, or
principal component analysis. For this study, recordings of data were gathered during approximately 11 months,
preprocessed, and ﬁltered by different operational modes, namely standstill, partial load, and full load. The re-
sults indicate that all feature selection techniques were able to maintain high accuracy when trained with artiﬁcial
neural networks. The neighbourhood component analysis yields the lowest number of features required while
maintaining the interpretability with an absolute mean squared error of around 0.07 % for full load. Finally, the
applicability of the resulting model for predicting loads in the wind turbine is tested by reducing the amount
of data used for training by 50 %. This analysis shows that the predictive model can be used for continuous
monitoring of loads in the tower of the wind turbine.
1 Introduction
Wind power is becoming the electricity-generating technol-
ogy with the lowest costs in several areas of the world
(REN21, 2018). To ensure the cost-competitiveness of this
technology in the future, it is important to seize the po-
tential cost reductions related to operation and mainte-
nance (O & M). This includes improving monitoring solu-
tions and life extension strategies. The possibility of moni-
toring with sensors has enabled the gathering and supervi-
sion of data regarding the condition of a structure to for ex-
ample detect failures. In particular, structural health moni-
toring (SHM) in wind turbines (WTs) allows monitoring thestructural behaviour and stresses of structures such as blades,
towers, and foundations.
While machine learning techniques are widely applied in
industries such as the automotive, information technology,
and communication industry, the wind industry is starting to
explore the suitability of these promising methods for their
beneﬁts. Although data-driven attempts have been made to
estimate the loads acting on the turbine using available in-
formation from the supervisory control and data acquisition
(SCADA) system, there is no consensus yet on the type of
relationship existent between these data and actual load mea-
surements. In the last years, the focus on this topic increased.

540 A. Movsessian et al.: Feature selection techniques for modelling tower fatigue loads of a wind turbine
This section aims to review available scientiﬁc literature re-
garding modelling loads with existing SCADA data for WTs.
SHM systems could be used to verify structural safety
and determine the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) of
WTs (Schedat et al., 2016). Moreover, information gathered
through SHM during the lifetime of WTs can potentially be
used to identify structural weaknesses and feed this informa-
tion back to the manufacturers, ultimately improving the de-
sign of new turbines (Ziegler et al., 2018). Another potential
beneﬁt of SHM is a decrease in maintenance costs. Typically,
operation and maintenance costs (including both ﬁxed and
variable costs) represent approximately 20 % to 25 % of the
levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) (IRENA, 2015). SHM
could reduce this share by allowing the implementation and
establishment of more efﬁcient maintenance practices such
as predictive maintenance while enabling better spare-part
inventory management. Consequently, downtime is reduced
and production is increased.
Currently, the assessment and evaluation of the structural
condition of WTs without a load measurement system can
be challenging. Particularly the estimation of fatigue loads
can be difﬁcult due to a lack of information (Melsheimer et
al., 2015; Schedat and Faber, 2017). Therefore, exploring the
ways to mine data from SHM systems and extract valuable
information becomes an interesting and high-demand ﬁeld of
research.
Ziegler et al. (2018) performed a literature review and
assessed the development of the lifetime extension market
of onshore WTs. The alternative to extending the lifetime
of a WT, as opposed to repowering or decommissioning, is
appealing given the potential increase in returns on invest-
ments (ROIs); however, not much public research has been
done on this matter. The authors contributed, then, by com-
paring updated load simulations and inspections for lifetime
extension assessments in Germany, Spain, Denmark, and the
United Kingdom. For lifetime extension to be a feasible al-
ternative, the structural integrity of the turbine should not
compromise the level of safety. In this regard, the survey per-
formed by the authors determined that, beyond the use of
SCADA systems, no short-term load measurements or mon-
itoring are carried out in the countries surveyed (a few ex-
ceptions were identiﬁed in the UK, where load reassessment
is performed). They found that most interviewees focus on
practical assessments for cost reasons. Nevertheless, these
practical inspections are no guarantee that the safety level
can be maintained during the lifetime extension. The authors
concluded that new operation and maintenance strategies and
data-processing methodologies are necessary for lifetime ex-
tension purposes. In this regard, data-driven approaches may
contribute to the cost reduction of lifetime extension assess-
ments.
In line with the ﬁndings of Ziegler et al. (2018), other
authors have worked on the aforementioned data-driven ap-
proaches. Noppe et al. (2018), for example, reconstructed
the thrust loads history of a WT based on both simulatedand measured SCADA data. The data gathered corresponded
to operational 1 s and 10 min. Moreover, the data are segre-
gated into different operational modes. The selection of ex-
planatory variables that the authors performed was based on
a Pearson correlation analysis. The ﬁrst 2 weeks of opera-
tional data were used to model the thrust loads using neural
networks and validated by 1 year of data. The model has the
following input features: wind speed, blade pitch angle, rotor
speed, and generated power. The results of this study showed
that the constructed model was able to estimate thrust loads
with a relative error that does not exceed 15 %. The authors
also concluded that the use of simulated data yielded slightly
better results and that adjustments in the hyperparameters of
the neural networks had no signiﬁcant impact on the esti-
mated thrust loads.
Relatedly, Vera-Tudela and Kühn (2014) focused on the
selection of variables to be used for fatigue load monitor-
ing and attempted to deﬁne an optimum set of explanatory
variables for that purpose. The authors identiﬁed 117 poten-
tial variables (13 statistics of nine SCADA signals) used in
related scientiﬁc literature. Among them, the mean of gen-
erator speed, electrical power, and pitch angle have been the
most commonly used. The authors decided to apply several
feature selection methods to six sets of variables. The meth-
ods chosen included Spearman coefﬁcients, stepwise regres-
sion, cross-correlation, hierarchical clustering, and principal
components. To evaluate the outcomes of the feature selec-
tion methods a feed-forward neural network was employed.
The authors concluded that principal components yielded the
best set of variables; however, the resulting set lost expertise
knowledge about the relation between the variables. In this
sense, ranking the variables by their corresponding Spearman
coefﬁcients resulted in a fair compromise between the num-
ber of features required to monitor the damage-equivalent
load for blade out of plane bending moment and the avail-
able expert knowledge.
Smolka and Cheng (2013) examined the amount and type
of data necessary to determine a fatigue estimator for the op-
erational lifetime of a WT. The inputs for the neural network
are selected through a correlation analysis applied to stan-
dard data statistics of available SCADA signals such as elec-
trical power, generator speed, and pitch angle, among oth-
ers. The authors concluded that the minimum training data
sample size required is approximately half a month worth of
measurements.
Seifert et al. (2017), acknowledging the complexity and
cost of handling extra measurements, assessed the minimum
needed size of a training sample to predict fatigue loads us-
ing 10 min statistics of SCADA signals and neural networks.
In a sense, Seifert et al.’s (2017) work is an extension or con-
tinuation of Vera-Tudela and Kühn’s (2014) and Smolka et
al.’s (2013). Seifert et al. (2017) tested different sample sizes
varying between 1 d (i.e. 144 records) and 4 months (i.e.
4032 records) of measurements. They determined that a sam-
ple of 2016 records of 10 min statistics is sufﬁcient to predict

ﬂap-wise blade root bending moments of a WT independent
of seasonal effects.
The reconstruction or estimation of loads using statis-
tics from SCADA data was already presented and tested in
the mid-2000s. Cosack and Kühn (2006) developed a step-
wise regression model for estimating the rotor thrust. De-
spite the good results (i.e. deviations between the calculated
and the estimated loads ranging from 5.4 % to 7.3 % in the
worst case), the presented model was too complex and time-
consuming with further restrictions. In a new development of
the model, an estimation method for the corresponding target
values (i.e. damage-equivalent loads and load magnitude dis-
tributions) used neural networks (Cosack, 2010; Cosack and
Kühn, 2007).
The performance of artiﬁcial neural networks depends on
the quality of the information provided to them; thus, the
features used to train them are key to obtaining high accu-
racy in the results with a parsimonious model. So far, little
research has been done regarding feature selection for mod-
elling tower fatigue loads. The available literature has fo-
cused on techniques such as correlation analysis, principal
component analysis (PCA), and stepwise regression to select
the best subset of information. This paper aims to contribute
to this body of literature by assessing the use of neighbour-
hood component analysis (NCA) as a feature selection tech-
nique to extract relevant information from SCADA data to
train artiﬁcial neural networks and model fatigue loads.
The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 outlines the
methodology followed in this study, Sect. 3 summarizes the
results, and, ﬁnally, Sect. 4 presents the conclusions derived
from the obtained results.
2 Data and methodology
2.1 Wind turbine and SCADA data
This paper seeks to model the tower fatigue loads of a com-
mercial wind turbine with a rated power of 2.05 MW, a hub
height of 100 m, and a rotor diameter of 92.5 m located in the
northern part of Germany. The turbine is used for research
purposes by the Wind Energy Technology Institute at the
Flensburg University of Applied Sciences. For this study, the
readings from the SCADA and a load measurement system in
the previously mentioned turbine were recorded for around
11 months and collected in 10 min ﬁles. The tower bottom
bending moment is measured by strain gauges. These were
installed and wired as full bridge (Wheatstone) with tem-
perature compensation. A Wheatstone bridge is widely used
in strain gauge applications because of its ability to mea-
sure small deviations in resistance. The calibration factors
were determined from the results of the shunt resistor cali-
bration, tower geometry, and the thickness of the tower wall
at the strain gauge positions (provided by the turbine man-
ufacturer). The offsets are determined through a yaw round.
The sensors used to extract features for the model are de-scribed in Table 1 and were selected based on a literature
review and consultations with an application engineer.
The strain gauge measurements at the turbine were trans-
formed into a resultant fore–aft tower bending moment,
which was later used to calculate the short-term damage-
equivalent load (DEL) for every 10 min time series. This
calculation was performed through a rainﬂow counting al-
gorithm, and, later, the resulting load spectrum was further
reduced to a constant load range. After several equivalent
cycles, this load range results in the same equivalent accu-
mulated damage as the spectrum of loads previously cal-
culated through the rainﬂow counting algorithm. The short-
term DELs were calculated following Eq. (1):

where neqis the equivalent number of cycles, Siis the dif-
ferent load ranges, niis the corresponding cycle numbers,
andmis given by the slope of the stress–cycle ( S N)
curve of the material used for the tower (DNV/Risø, 2002).
In this case, an inverse slope mD3 for the steel tower and
neqD9:5064 for the 10 min time series (equivalent to 107cy-
cles in 20 years) is assumed. The DELs were then used as the
dependent variable of the model.
2.2 Methods
The methodology followed in this study is graphically de-
scribed in Fig. 1. First, the sensors which provide relevant
information to model resultant fore–aft tower bending mo-
ments were selected (see Table 1). In the next step, the result-
ing records were analysed for missing data (e.g. zero values)
and outliers as there were periods where the turbine was out
of service or measurement failures with no registered data.
Subsequently, affected records were removed. The process
of outlier detection in this study was not automated but done
through visual inspection of the descriptive statistics calcu-
lated from the time series for each operational mode. To de-
termine the relationship between the dependent and nine ex-
planatory variables described previously, each of the 10 min
ﬁles was summarized by estimating the following descrip-
tive statistics for every explanatory variable: (i) minimum
value, (ii) maximum value, (iii) arithmetic mean, (iv) range,
(v) mode, (vi) standard deviation, and (vii) variance.
In this way, the dataset consists of 63 features (i.e. explana-
tory variables, see Appendix A1). Excluding the time where
no SCADA data were recorded, the total amount of data re-
sults in 36 266 (77.1 %) observations. This corresponds to a
little over 8 months of useful information.
Relationships between sensor signals and the estimated
DELs can vary depending on the operational mode of the
wind turbine; e.g. the pitch angle operates mainly during
startup and full load. Methods with an underlying linear as-

sumption, such as the correlation analysis, can lead to misin-
terpretation of feature importance when observing the com-
plete dataset. Therefore, the data were ﬁltered by operational
modes, namely standstill, partial, and full load to study the
relevance of the different potential features for these opera-
tional modes. Additionally, this ﬁlter enables the construc-
tion of individual models to account for the particularities of
each operational mode, thereby improving the accuracy of
the monitoring system. The ﬁltering was done employing the
feature ACpow, which refers to active power output. In this
sense, standstill corresponds to 10 min mean ACpow read-
ings below or equal to 5 kW (0.25 % of nominal power), par-
tial load to readings higher than 5 kW and below or equal to
2000 kW (97.56 % of nominal power), and full load to read-
ings above 2000 kW.
Research by Sharma and Saroha (2015) concluded that a
reduction of dimensions possibly leads to a better perfor-
mance of the mining algorithms while maintaining a good
accuracy; therefore, it is important to eliminate potential re-
dundant data and select the variables with the most predictive
power for the model. For this, three different feature selec-
tion techniques and one dimension reduction technique were
applied to the entire dataset and the datasets resulting from
ﬁltering the data by operational mode.
These techniques include Pearson correlation, stepwise re-
gression, NCA, and PCA. Pearson correlation measures the
linear correlation between two variables and maps the result
to an interval between  1 and 1, where 0 indicates no linearrelationship (Boslaugh and Watters, 2008). It can be calcu-
lated as per Eq. (2):

where nis the sample size, XiandYiare the observa-
tions with index i, and Xrepresents the arithmetic mean of
all samples. A threshold value of 0.5 was set to deﬁne the
strength of the correlation. In this sense, a correlation coef-
ﬁcient between 0 and 0.49 is weak and a correlation coefﬁ-
cient between 0.5 and 0.95 is strong. Correlation among all
features of a particular sensor above 0.95 was considered as
a redundant sensor and, therefore, eliminated from further
analyses.
Stepwise regression is an iterative method where features
are added and removed from a multilinear model based on
their statistical signiﬁcance in the regression (Draper and
Smith, 1998). The algorithm begins by constructing an ini-
tial model with one feature (forward selection) or all the fea-
tures (backward selection) and continues adding or removing
features by comparing the explanatory power of the larger
or smaller models. At each step, the pvalue of the corre-
sponding Fstatistic is estimated and compared to a threshold
pvalue to decide which features are included in or excluded
from the model. The pvalue is used as a probability mea-

sure to identify if a particular feature is signiﬁcant for the
outcome of the model. If a pvalue is larger than 0.05, the
null hypothesis is true and the feature is selected for further
modelling. The algorithm repeats this process until the added
feature does not improve the model or until all features that
do not improve the explanatory power of the model are re-
moved. This method is considered to be locally optimal yet
not globally optimal given that the selection of features in-
cluded in the initial model is subjective and there is no guar-
antee that a different initial model will not lead to a better
ﬁt.
NCA is a non-parametric classiﬁcation model used for
metric learning and linear dimensionality reduction (Gold-
berger et al., 2004). It is based on a modelling technique
known as k-nearest neighbours ( k-NNs), which is a super-
vised learning algorithm used for classiﬁcation or regressions
(Han and Kamber, 2011; Parsian, 2015). In its simplest form,
thek-NN approach looks for the closest kD1 observation tothe query observation xqwithin the training dataset by mea-
suring the distances to the neighbouring data points and se-
lecting the one that satisﬁes the min idistance ( xi,xq). The
output is then predicted by applying a function yDh(x),
where his the trained k-NN prediction function. In a mul-
tidimensional dataset, the k-NN approach requires us to dif-
ferentiate between the relevance of the explanatory variables
for the intended output. For the learning process, different
weights can be assigned to the features of the model using
the scales Euclidian distance estimation detailed in Eq. (3):

Lastly, PCA is a statistical method to reduce the dimen-
sions of a dataset that presumably contains a large number of
irrelevant features while retaining the maximum information
possible (Vidal et al., 1987). This is done by transforming the
original set of multidimensional data into a new set referred
to as components employing eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
A pair of eigenvector and eigenvalue indicates respectively
the direction and how much variance there is in the data in
that direction. The eigenvector with the highest eigenvalue is
the ﬁrst principal component. In this sense, the transforma-
tion allows reducing the dimensions of the dataset to a few
components with relatively low loss of information.
Table 2 summarizes the strengths and limitations of all the
methods considered for feature selection and dimension re-
duction in this study.
In this way, 16 neural networks (NNs) were developed for
four datasets (all operational modes, standstill, partial load,
and full load), three feature selection techniques, and one di-
mension reduction technique. Each dataset is divided into
training, validation, and testing subsets. For this, 70 % of a
dataset is randomly chosen and used by NNs for training the
model, 15 % is used for testing, and 15 % is used for valida-tion; i.e. this subset is used to adjust the model through the
mean squared error (MSE). This adjustment stops when the
MSE does not signiﬁcantly improve. The validation subset is
used as a measure to avoid overﬁtting the NNs and generalize
the prediction model. After that, the model can be applied to
new datasets. The test subset does not affect training or val-
idation; it is only used to measure the performance of the
trained NNs.
The NN models used in this paper are trained with
the Neural Network Toolbox from MATLAB (MathWorks,
2019). The standard settings consist of a two-layer feed-
forward NN with a sigmoid transfer function in the hid-
den layer and a linear transfer function in the output layer.
The NN was initially set to 25 neurons in the hidden layer
and 1 neuron in the output layer as per Lind (2017). How-
ever, we tested different conﬁgurations and found that the
results remain consistent. Therefore, the number of neurons
in the hidden layer is set to 10 neurons and 1 neuron in the
output layer. This simple conﬁguration reduces the compu-
tational complexity and time while enabling the modelling
of non-linear relationships. The Levenberg–Marquardt algo-
rithm is selected as the training algorithm. The results from
the 16 models were compared to derive conclusions about the
relationship between operational data and tower loads acting
on WTs.

Finally, the predictive capability of the model for continu-
ous monitoring is tested. For this purpose, the NN is trained
using only the ﬁrst 50 % of the data gathered during partial
load. The prediction error is estimated to determine the accu-
racy of the model.
3 Results and discussion
This section describes the sensors identiﬁed by different
methods as potential predictors of tower fatigue loads of the
WT and presents the results of using a predictive model for
continuous monitoring.
3.1 Feature selection and dimension reduction
Before building a model to predict the desired output, it is
important to deﬁne which variables could act as predictors.
The feature selection methods described in Sect. 2.2 were ap-
plied to four different datasets: (i) an 8-month dataset, (ii) a
full-load dataset, (iii) a partial load dataset, and (iv) a stand-
still dataset. The results of the feature selection methods are
described below. For detailed information on selected fea-
tures for each operational mode, the reader is referred to Ap-
pendix A1.
3.1.1 Complete dataset: 8-month data
A Pearson correlation analysis was applied to the pre-
selected features for predicting the DELs of the fore–aft
bending moment of the tower. Before using the features with
the strongest correlation in a model, it is necessary to check
for collinearity, i.e. the correlation between independent vari-
ables. A high correlation between two explanatory variables
suggests that these variables should be excluded from the
model to avoid collinearity issues. From this analysis, it was
determined that rotational speed at the rotor should be ex-
cluded from the model and only rotational speed at the gen-
erator should be included given that these two features are a
factor away from each other and, thus, may add bias to the
model due to redundancy. This resulted in 56 features from
the initial 63 (see Sect. 2.2).
The correlation analysis shows that only 27 of the 56 fea-
tures are strongly correlated and should be used as indepen-
dent variables in the model. The accelerations in both direc-
tions (i.e. xandyaxis) are highly correlated with the DELs.
The standard deviation of the acceleration in the xdirection
presents the highest correlation with a coefﬁcient of 0.97,
depicting an almost linear relationship between this feature
and the dependent variable. Additionally, several statistics
of wind speed and power output are also highly correlated
with the DELs. As an example, the bilinear relationship be-
tween the mean wind speed and the calculated DEL (Fig. 2)
is graphically shown over the complete measurement cam-
paign and for all operational modes in Fig. 2c below.These results suggest that these features ﬂuctuate together
with the dependent variable, and they could potentially be
used to build a model that can estimate the DELs of the fore–
aft bending moments of the tower without installing strain
gauge sensors.
Furthermore, the results show that air density and relative
wind direction, along with all their corresponding descrip-
tive statistics, have a very low correlation with the DELs and
should be, therefore, disregarded in the model based on this
feature selection technique. The mean wind direction, in par-
ticular, has a correlation coefﬁcient close to zero, indicating
an insigniﬁcant linear relationship with the DELs. Many of
the remaining variables are highly correlated with each other;
nevertheless, they add potentially valuable information to the
model.
An alternative would be the use of a method such as
PCA which could contribute to avoiding multicollinearity by
transforming the data while maintaining the information con-
tained in them. After using PCA on the remaining 27 fea-
tures, 12 principal components are identiﬁed and can be used
to build a model. These data were transformed as explained
in Sect. 2.2 estimating the variance explained by each of the
ﬁrst components as seen in Fig. 3. It can be observed that
99 % of the information contained in the features is now
stored in the ﬁrst 12 components. The remaining 15 com-
ponents explain less than 1 % of the cumulative variance. A
model could be built using the ﬁrst 12 components, and the
results should be almost as accurate as using the 27 features
selected after the correlation analysis. The biggest disadvan-
tage with this method is that, given the transformation of the
data, it is no longer possible to interpret it. The results, nev-
ertheless, remain interpretable and are free of the inﬂuence
of multicollinearity.
Alternatively, an interactive stepwise regression was built
using the pre-selected 56 features. Different combinations
of features were tested to identify those that should not be
included in the model given that they do not contribute to
the predictive power or result in an increase in the error of
the model. The features with a pvalue above 0.1 should be
omitted from the model. The results suggest excluding a to-
tal of 30 variables from the regression model. Among these
the minimum, maximum, mean, and range of the rotational
speed at the generator; most descriptive statistics of air den-
sity, except for the standard deviation; and range, mode, and
standard deviation of the acceleration in the ydirection can
be found .
It is important to highlight that the variable that represents
the range of the acceleration sensor in the xdirection was
identiﬁed as statistically insigniﬁcant despite its high corre-
lation with DELs. As mentioned earlier, the possible models
explored with the stepwise regression are limited. The algo-
rithm builds different models from the 56 features depend-
ing on the order in which these features are added to (in the
case of forward selection) or removed from (in the case of
backward elimination) the models. In this sense, the range of

the sensor acc_x and the variance of acc_x, which are cor-
related with a factor of 0.90, could be considered mutually
exclusive. The decision as to which of these variables to in-
clude in the model would depend solely on which variable
is added or removed ﬁrst in the stepwise regression. In this
case, the algorithm suggests excluding the range of acc_x, a
highly correlated feature, based on the search for the local
minimum instead of evaluating all combinations. Ultimately,
this method identiﬁed 33 features as statistically signiﬁcant,
and, thus, these are included in the model.
The last feature selection method, NCA, was applied as
well to the dataset with 56 features. A total of 13 features
were identiﬁed by this method as relevant for the prediction
of DELs, a signiﬁcantly smaller number than those selected
by applying the correlation analysis and stepwise regression.
To summarize, mean values and standard deviations are
the descriptive statistics that can best describe the data ac-
cording to the three feature selection methods applied. Fea-
tures selected by all three methods include wind speed, ac-
celeration, and power output.3.1.2 Data ﬁltered by operational modes
The dataset was divided by operational modes into 10 min
samples with 7825 (21.6 %) of the measurements corre-
sponding to standstill, 25 604 (70.6 %) to partial load, and
2837 (7.8 %) to full load. Each dataset contains 56 features
and the corresponding DELs.
The ﬁrst feature selection method used in these new
datasets is again the Pearson correlation analysis. The results
show that most of the descriptive statistics for wind speed and
acceleration are highly correlated with the DELs in all oper-
ational modes. The ﬁrst differences appear in the generator
speed. As expected, the generator speed is not relevant dur-
ing standstill since the rotor is not moving or is only idling.
The mean generator speed is not as relevant in full load as
it is in partial load. During full load, the rotational speed is
around a speciﬁed number and must be kept as stable as pos-
sible. Therefore, the mean rotational speed does not change
signiﬁcantly during full load. During partial load, the mean
rotational speed is within a higher range; therefore, it has a
higher correlation with the corresponding DELs.
During full load, the standard deviation and variance of the
rotational speed are highly correlated with the DELs. The
standard deviation explains how the values differ from the
mean; thus, conclusions about the dynamics of the turbine
can be derived based on these spreads. For example, ﬂuc-
tuations of the rotational speed during full load have a sig-
niﬁcant effect on the tower movement, which explains the
high correlation between the standard deviations of the ro-
tational speed with the DELs. Additionally, several descrip-
tive statistics of the pitch angle are correlated with the DEL
exhibiting correlation coefﬁcients greater than 0.5. This cor-
relation is only signiﬁcant during full load. The pitch angle
is held at the most efﬁcient lift-to-drag ratio during the par-
tial load, and, therefore, not many variations can be observed
during standstill and partial load. During full load, the tur-

bine pitches continuously to keep the rotational speed nearly
constant. For each operational mode, PCA was performed to
account for potential collinearity in the feature set. This was
done consistently with an explained variance of 99 % remain-
ing.
The second feature selection method applied is stepwise
regression. The results are not consistent with the correla-
tion analysis. Air density and wind direction did not corre-
late with the DELs; however, they were chosen by the step-
wise regression during standstill and partial load as potential
predictors. Also, the pitch was chosen as a signiﬁcant vari-
able during standstill, even though the turbine is not pitch-
ing. In general, the modeller needs to be careful when inter-
preting the results from a stepwise regression as described in
Sect. 2.2.
NCA was applied to the three datasets. Examining the re-
sults, one signiﬁcant difference to the correlation analysis is
that the wind direction was identiﬁed as signiﬁcant during
standstill and partial load by the NCA, whereas the corre-
lation analysis showed no correlation of these features with
the output during any operational mode. Furthermore, the
range of the pitch angle was identiﬁed as relevant during par-
tial load, which was not the case in the correlation analysis.
Mean acceleration in the xdirection and the standard devi-
ation were the only two features identiﬁed as signiﬁcant by
the NCA in all three operational modes.
3.2 Modelling fatigue loads
Once the features with predictive power have been identiﬁed
for the different datasets, NNs are built to evaluate the predic-
tions. The outcomes of these models are described hereafter.
3.2.1 Eight-month data with all operational modes
The ﬁrst analysis is conducted on 8-month data without ﬁl-
tering by operational modes. To illustrate the results, features
used for training the NN is selected by using the correlation
analysis and can be examined in Appendix A1. The data are
randomly split into training, testing, and validation sets. The
regression model of the NN in Fig. 4 shows a similar Rvalue
in all regressions, indicating that there is no overﬁtting in the
model.
TheRvalue for the complete dataset is 0.99564, which
can be conﬁrmed by observing the top plot in Fig. 5, where
the predicted DELs overlap with the measured DELs with a
mean prediction error of 2.22 % (see Table 3). Nevertheless,
the prediction error, shown in the bottom plot in Fig. 5, can
be as high as 685.79 %. Values close to zero can have a sig-
niﬁcant impact in terms of the mean error in percent due to a
high ratio of prediction and measured DELs.
Plotting the error against the wind speed for all operational
modes in Fig. 6, it can be concluded that the mean prediction
error is signiﬁcantly higher at low wind speeds. If the wind

work prediction and the measured DELs. The NN is built using the
complete dataset (i.e. 8 months) and 27 features selected after the
Pearson correlation analysis.
speed is below approximately 3 m s 1, the WT is at a stand-
still.
Comparing the results in Table 3, it can be seen that the
model using features selected by NCA results in the low-
est mean error. Overall, these results are signiﬁcantly higher
with the mean error ranging from 2.07 % to 2.94 % than those
obtained by Vera-Tudela and Kühn (2014) with the mean er-
ror ranging from 0.01 % to 0.22 %. This can be explained
by the high prediction error during low wind speeds seen in
Fig. 6. However, our results indicate that it is possible to sig-
niﬁcantly reduce the number of features used in the model
by applying NCA while maintaining a low prediction error.
NCA did not select features such as the variance of the ac-
celeration in the ydirection and the minimum wind speed
during a 10 min time series, which had been selected by the
correlation analysis and stepwise regression. This shows that
to model the DELs with NNs, these features are not rele-
vant and can be omitted without compromising the model’s
performance as suggested by the mean error of 2.07 % in Ta-
ble 3. Furthermore, the non-parametric nature of NCA en-
abled this technique to outperform the other techniques such
as correlation and stepwise regression, which are based on
the assumption of linear relationships.
3.2.2 Data ﬁltered by operational modes
This section explores the performance of the NN when built
with data subsets from different operational modes. It can be
observed that the mean percent error is signiﬁcantly high in
standstill compared to other operational modes as shown in

Table 4. Nevertheless, the mean absolute error in kilonewton
metres (kNm) is the lowest. The high maximum error ob-
served previously when using the complete 8-month dataset
(i.e. when using all operational modes) for the different train-
ing sets could be explained by the poor predictive power of
the data from the standstill mode. When the NN was built
using ﬁltered data for partial and full load, the errors of the
predictions decreased signiﬁcantly. Thus, it can be concluded
that the data from the standstill mode add uncertainty to the
model. This can be observed in Fig. 7.
Presumably, the small variations observed in the readings
from the sensors during standstill do not provide enough in-formation to predict the DELs. This is consistent with the
Rvalues of the model during standstill mode. These val-
ues are the lowest among the different operational modes. A
more detailed look at this case would be necessary to derive
valuable insight.
Moreover, Table 4 shows that the partial and full-load
models constructed using smaller sets of features derived
from the application of methods such as PCA or NCA have
approximately the same predictive power as those models
constructed using larger sets of features derived from apply-
ing methods such as stepwise regression or correlation anal-
ysis. This can be observed in the comparison of the measures
of goodness of ﬁt (i.e. Rvalues) among the models. Nev-
ertheless, it is important to mention that to apply PCA the
complete feature set is needed to transform all the informa-
tion in the ﬁrst few components. This is not the case when
applying NCA, where the most relevant features are directly
identiﬁed.
The application of feature selection and dimension reduc-
tion methods can be considered a good practice. NCA outper-
formed all other methods in terms of the mean error in stand-
still and full load. In partial load, NCA still performed well;

however, correlation and correlation–PCA yielded slightly
lower mean errors.
The results can be compared to the existing work from
Vera-Tudela and Kühn (2014). In the case of the full load
model, the mean error, the maximum absolute error, and stan-
dard deviation of the error are in similar ranges. However, the
accuracy of the results from the partial load model is slightly
worse for all feature sets.
3.2.3 Continuous monitoring with a predictive model
In this section, the results of using a predictive model for
continuous monitoring are presented. The aim is to identify
if and how the errors in the outcomes of the model vary when
using only the ﬁrst 50 % of data gathered. The model is tested
by predicting the DELs corresponding to the remaining share
of the data. The majority (i.e. 70.6 %) of all data gatheredcorresponds to the partial load mode; therefore, this subset
was selected for this analysis. As in the previous analysis,
four models are built using the feature sets from the cor-
relation analysis, correlation and PCA, stepwise regression,
and NCA.
Figure 8 shows the prediction error from the model us-
ing the feature set from the correlation analysis. It can be
seen that the mean absolute prediction error from the model
trained using the ﬁrst 50 % of the data gathered is 211 kNm
(see Table 5). This value is lower than the mean absolute
error from using this trained model to predict the remain-
ing 50 % of the data, which yields 244 kNm (see Table 6).
Nonetheless, the opposite is true for the mean error (in per-
centage). This variation can be explained by the same rela-
tionship observed previously in Figs. 6 and 7, where the pre-
diction error decreases at high wind speeds. As can be seen in

Fig. 9, the average mean wind speed is higher in the second
half of the partial load dataset, which was used for testing.
The same behaviour is observed in the remaining models.
Overall, the mean error is lower in the results from the mod-
els trained using the second half of the datasets as can be seen
when comparing Tables 5 and 6.
4 Conclusions
This paper used available SCADA data as well as strain
gauge measurements from a research WT to develop a pre-
dictive model to estimate the DELs of the fore–aft bending
moments of a WT tower. The dataset included over 8 months
of useful data. Different feature selection methods and a di-
mension reduction technique were applied to choose the sen-
sors with the strongest predictive power. The data were then
inputted into a feed-forward neural network. The methodol-ogy and data used reproduce and enhance the approaches of
similar studies in the ﬁeld of SHM.
The results indicate that using all data and applying
NCA for feature selection yield an interpretable and low-
dimensional feature set while maintaining high accuracy. Ad-
ditionally, dimension reduction techniques such as PCA can
contribute to a more parsimonious model reducing the num-
ber of features needed but compromising the interpretability
of the inputs given the transformation of the data.
The results were signiﬁcantly better, i.e. yielded lower
mean absolute errors, when the dataset was divided by oper-
ational modes. The models were signiﬁcantly more accurate
when analysing the operation of the turbine at full load and
partial load. The outcome of the model using signals from
when the turbine was standing still was rather inaccurate with
mean errors ranging from 6 % to 14 %. In partial load, the er-
rors vary between 0.69 % and 1.21 % and in full load between

of the NN is inﬂuenced by the operational mode of the WT.
Finally, a model for continuous monitoring was built. For
this, the ﬁrst 50 % of partial load data were used for training
and show stable results in terms of prediction accuracy for
the remaining data. All feature selection techniques showed
similar results when predicting DELs for continuous moni-
toring. The feature set resulting from the application of cor-
relation analysis and PCA yielded the lowest mean error yet
the second largest standard deviation for these errors. Since
the results are not signiﬁcantly different for each feature se-
lection technique, the use of NCA is preferred for the follow-
ing reasons:
–it results in a signiﬁcant reduction of features (up to
86 % during full load), which also leads to faster mod-
elling of the DELs;
–the interpretability of features is maintained.
This study showed that NCA can be included as a reliable and
efﬁcient feature selection method for modelling tower fatigue
loads with NNs, particularly due to its non-parametric na-
ture. Nevertheless, the performance of this technique relative
to other techniques such as correlation analysis or stepwise
regression will depend on the particularities of the case study
(operational conditions, availability and location of the sen-
sors, characteristics of the WT, etc.). The decision of which
technique should be used to build the NN model should be
based on the knowledge of the strengths and limitations of
the techniques in consideration.This study was limited to only one WT. To be able to gen-
eralize the results obtained from this study, the NN model
requires validation with data collected from a different wind
turbine with the same speciﬁcations. By doing this, it will be
possible to determine the relationship between SCADA data
and fatigue loads with more precision, thereby eliminating
the need to install expensive gauge sensors to estimate these
loads and contributing to more efﬁcient SHM methods.
Furthermore, the methodology developed during this study
could be further tested through an analytical aeroelastic
model. Such a model would provide larger datasets for stand-
still and full load to test the predictive capabilities for contin-
uous monitoring without the signiﬁcant costs that this would
imply if done empirically. The results of the NN trained with
information from the aeroelastic model can be compared
to the results presented in this paper to derive conclusions
on the reliability and accuracy of this methodology. Finally,
the results could beneﬁt from exploring alternative machine
learning algorithms such as support vector machine and k-
nearest neighbours.

554 A. Movsessian et al.: Feature selection techniques for modelling tower fatigue loads of a wind turbine
Data availability. The high-frequency measurements from the
SCADA and strain gauge sensors are not available due to conﬁ-
dentiality issues.
Author contributions. The work was carried out by AM, based
on his master’s thesis at the Wind Energy Technology Institute
under the supervision of MS and TF. AM preprocessed the data
for machine learning purposes, implemented feature selection tech-
niques, modelled fatigue loads with neural networks, and ran a sen-
sitivity analysis. MS initiated the issue, ran the data-gathering cam-
paign, and processed the raw data. All authors were involved in the
development of the manuscript.
Competing interests. The authors declare that they have no con-
ﬂict of interest.

Schleswig-Holstein within the funding programme Open-Access-
Publikationsfonds.
Review statement. This paper was edited by Ger-
ard J. W. van Bussel and reviewed by two anonymous referees.
