1Introduction
In recent years, the rapid expansion of wind power has assumed an increasingly prominent
position in the energy structure industry [ 1]. As a typical mechatronic product, the reliability of wind
turbine is particularly essential during the operation due to its function and structure increasing incomplexity with the continuously increasing unit capacity [ 2,3]. Direct drive wind turbines greatly
reduce the operation and maintenance costs of wind turbines by omitting the gearbox, meanwhile,the reliability of the spindle draws numerous scholars’ attention, As a critical component inside windturbine, the spindle not only carries various loads on the wheel hub, but also transmits torque tothe rotor, which has an influential effect on the cumulative reliability of wind turbine. Therefore,the operation state recognition and early warning of the spindle can effectively reduce the operation
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

and maintenance cost and downtime of the wind turbine, which is of vital significance to the stable
operation of the wind turbine.
The approaches of wind turbine operational condition monitoring include vibration signal
monitoring [ 4], electrical signal monitoring [ 5] and SCADA data monitoring [ 6]. In terms of vibration
signal monitoring, reference [ 7] represented the vibration signal by multi-scale dictionary method
to effectively extract the vibration signal for condition monitoring of wind turbine drive train.Reference [ 8] proposed a fault diagnosis strategy with excellent noise immunity through convolutional
neural network combined with random forest. As for electrical signal monitoring, reference [ 9]
developed an electromechanical model of a wind turbine with an integrated drive train fault model
based on electrical signals. Reference [ 10] employed a synchronous resampling algorithm to process
the non-stationary current signals for quantitative assessment of the wind turbine health status.While the above researches require the installation of a large number of sensors for signal acquisition,the failure of sensors not only reduces the reliability of the collected data, but also increases theadditional operation and maintenance costs. In addition, the electrical signal acquisition of failure datainformation is usually weak, which generates significant inaccuracies in monitoring results. In recentyears, the wind turbine monitoring driven by SCADA data has gradually emerged as a research hotspotin the field of wind turbines [ 11]. Reference [ 12] constructed a data-driven deep convolutional neural
network modeling framework for condition monitoring and performance prediction of wind turbines.Reference [ 13] adopted support vector machine to train a fault classifier for early fault detection
and classification of bearings. Reference [ 14] employed LightGBM method to construct wind turbine
condition monitoring and fault recognition model by adding condition labels based on SCADA data.Since the above researches require tagging a large amount of historical failure data, which is tediousand time-consuming, and the SCADA system of in-service wind turbines exports few failure data,which is difficult to be promoted and utilized in realistic monitoring of key wind turbine components.
Therefore, this work proposes a research method of wind turbine spindle operation status
recognition and early warning driven by SCADA data, which features status identification basedentirely on normally operating SCADA data without using any failure data. With the analysis of theSCADA data from a domestic 2.5 MW direct drive wind turbine, the spindle speed is selected as theoutput parameter for spindle operation status recognition, which focuses on extracting the relevantfeature parameters of spindle speed and establishing the prediction model to implement the spindleoperation status recognition and failure warning. In this work, Section 2 describes the SCADA data
and completes the related data pre-processing work, as well as establishes the spindle speed predictionmodel. In Section 3 , on the basis of interval estimation theory, the operating state index is applied
to determine the abnormal state threshold of wind turbine spindle operation, whereby the operating
status of wind turbine spindle is identified. In Section 4 , this approach is employed in the recognition
and early warning analysis of the operating state of a 2.5 MW wind turbine main shaft in a domesticwind farm. Section 5 , summarizes the relevant conclusions obtained from this work.

2.1Data Cleaning
With a domestic wind field F24 wind turbine as the research object, and the total 54607 sets of
data from 0:00 on July 01, 2018 to 0:00 on July 01, 2019 selected as the original research data. TheSCADA original research data format is shown in Table 1 .

In accordance with the wind speed-power characteristic curve and the distribution characteristics
of abnormal data, QM-DBSCAN method is utilized to exclude the abnormal data induced by extremeweather, component failure, wind curtailment. QM-DBSCAN is a methodology for identifying andcleaning wind speed-power data. It combines the quartile method (QM) and the density-based spatialclustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) to carry out the differentiated cleaning of abnormaldata according to the category and characteristics of wind speed-power data clusters. The cleaningeffect is shown in Fig. 1 .
Figure 1: The wind speed-power scatter after data cleaning by the QM-DBSCAN method
As shown in Fig. 1 ,“•” indicates normal data and “ ×” represents abnormal data, where the
abnormal data of type A is caused by wind abandonment and power limitation, which is manifestedas one or more clusters of data parallel to the horizontal axis in the middle of the wind speed-powercurve. The anomalous data of type B is generated by extreme weather and unit component failure,showing irregularly scattered points around the wind speed-power curve. By excluding 12,306 sets ofabnormal data by this method, the remaining normal data total 42,301 sets.
2.2Data Normalization
SCADA system captures operating data for 10 min, which mainly comprises monitoring param-
eters of wind speed, output power and spindle speed, and these parameters have different dimensions

to normalize the monitoring data after cleaning. The formula is as follows:

2.3Extraction of Features
Aiming at the characteristics of large volume, high dimensions and strong redundancy of the data
collected by wind turbine SCADA system, the feature extraction of the normalized SCADA datais carried out to eliminate irrelevant parameters, proposing a feature selection approach combiningSpearman correlation coefficient and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The spindle speedindicates the operating state of the spindle, hence the spindle speed is adopted as the output parameterto extract the operating parameters related to the spindle speed, where the Spearman correlationcoefficient is as follows:
r=/summationtext

i=1(xi−x)(yi−y)/radicalBig/summationtextn
i=1(xi−x)2/summationtextn

InEq. (2) ,xidenotes the i-th operating parameters data in SCADA data, and xis the average
value of the operating parameters in SCADA data. yidenotes the data of the i-th spindle speed in
SCADA data, while xis the spindle average in SCADA data.
Since the operating parameters have a varying influence on the spindle speed, the correlation
coefficient between the output parameter spindle speed and the remaining 49 monitoring parametersare calculated by using the method of Spearman correlation coefficient, and the monitoring parame-ters with correlation coefficients above 0.6 with spindle speed are selected as the initial characteristicparameters, the ranking results are summarized in Table 3 .

PCA is available within the feature extraction to retrieve further new variables that reflect the
original information of all variables and to eliminate redundant information among monitoring datato enhance the prediction accuracy of the model. The feature value, contribution rate and cumulative
contribution rate corresponding to each principal component as shown in Table 4 ,w h e r et h ef e a t u r e
value refers to the variance of the principal component, and the contribution rate represents thepercentage of the original information preserved after the dimension reduction of the primary variable,while the larger of the contribution rate indicates that more original variable information is preserved,whereas the cumulative contribution rate is the sum of the cumulative contribution rate. With theinclusion of 7 principal components, the cumulative contribution rate reached more than 98%, whichindicates that the new variables covered over 98% of the information of the original variables, thustransforming the original 13 variables into linearly uncorrelated 7 new variables as the final input ofthe prediction model.

Elman neural network is a recurrent neural network with local memory units and local feedback
connections, which has more capability to deal with dynamically changing data [ 17], wherein the
undertake layer is a specific hidden layer, which receives feedback signals from the hidden layer andthen passes forward to the hidden layer through the output of neurons in this layer, completing thelocal feedback connection and equipping the network with a memory so that the system has the ability
to make predictions on time series data, the structure of Elman neural network is shown in Fig. 3 .

2indicates the reliability of the spindle speed variation with the value of [0,1].
The closer the R2is to 1, then it indicates that the better interpretation of the input variables on the
spindle speed, and the higher accuracy of the model prediction. Since R2has an exact range of values,
it is calculated by Eq. (16) that the R2of ELM, SVR, Elman and combined prediction models are
0.9957, 0.9934, 0.9965 and 0.9972, respectively. With R2of each prediction model exceeding 0.99, which
indicates that over 99% of the spindle speed can be determined by the seven characteristic parameters,
the prediction accuracy of all four models has high accuracy and favorable reliability.
4The Principle of Recognition of Spindle Operation Status
4.1Operating State Index
Due to the strong randomness of wind speed, temperature and other environmental factors during
the operation of wind turbines, for avoiding the false alarms caused by larger instantaneous error, the
sliding window model is adopted to process the data, the window width is set to N, and the root mean
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
1232 EE, 2023, vol.120, no.5
square of the change in the predicted value of the spindle speed relative to the monitored value and
the monitored value is considered as the operating state index [ 19], and the calculation formula is as
follows:
C(N)=/radicaltp/radicalvertex/radicalvertex/radicalbt/summationtextN
i=1/parenleftbig
yi−ˆyi/parenrightbig2
/summationtextN
i=1(yi)2(17)
where yiandˆyirespectively indicate the actual monitored and predicted values of the spindle speed. The
operation state index can quantify the deviation degree of the wind turbine spindle from the normaloperation state. Operation state index is smaller to indicate that the spindle operation is closer to thenormal operation status, and vice versa, the more deviated from the normal operation status.
4.2Early Warning Threshold
It is known that the operation state index C(N) is constantly greater than or equal to 0, On the
basis of the theory of interval estimation in statistics, if P{0≤C(N)≤Cth}=1−αis satisfied, [0,
Cth] is regarded as a confidence interval with confidence for the operation state index C(N),Thus, the
confidence upper limit C this expressed as
Cth=C+σ√ntα(n−1)+3σ (18)
where Cis the mean value of the state index C(N) during normal operation of the wind turbine spindle,
σindicates the standard deviation of the statistical calculation of the operating state index, nrepresents
the total number of samples of the state index during operation of the wind turbine spindle, while α
serves as the set small probability value.
In accordance with the small probability principle, with 1 −αas the confidence level, the operation
status indicator has a very small probability of being greater than the confidence upper limit, hencewhen C(N)>C
th, the wind turbine spindle operation status is evaluated to be abnormal, and the
confidence upper limit is regarded as the threshold value here. After establishing the spindle speedprediction model by the normal SCADA data, according to the principle of spindle operation statusidentification, the sliding window width Nis set to 10 and the increment qis 1. The spindle operation
status index is calculated by Eq. (17) and taken as 0.05 on the basis of the small probability principle,
and then the warning threshold is calculated according to Eq. (18) . In this work, an early warning is
granted when the operation state index exceeds the threshold C
thf o rt h r e et i m e si nar o wo rm o r e .
5Case Analysis
This work is implemented to recognize the spindle speed status of a domestic wind farm 2.5 MW
wind turbine with a cut-in wind speed of 3 m/s, a rated wind speed of 10.7 m/s, a cut-out wind speedof 25 m/s, and a rated power of 2500 KW using one year of SCADA historical monitoring data of thewind turbine.
5.1Determination of the Optimal Prediction Model
By establishing an effective spindle speed normal behavior data-driven model to obtain the
residuals that reflect the spindle operation status, the spindle speed ELM, SVR, Elman and Combinednormal behavior models are respectively established with R language software in conjunction with the
normal data obtained after pre-processing, and the optimal spindle speed model is determined by
evaluating indexes MAPE ,RMSE ,MAE andR

As shown in Fig. 5 , each single model’s spindle speed monitoring value basically overlaps with the

As can be seen from Fig. 6 , the residual value of the combination model has a maximum of
−0.0841 at point D, namely D (673, −0.0841), with a mean residual value of 0.0027, in which the
maximum value of the residual of the combined model is 0.0974 and 0.0765 respectively less than themaximum value of the residual of the ELM and SVR single models, while compared with the Elmansingle model increased by 0.0009. In addition, as the mean value of residuals increased by 0.0025 and0.0006 when compared with ELM and SVR model, whereas the mean value of residuals decreased by0.0035 compared with Elman model, hence the optimal model is not evaluated by the maximum valueof residuals and the mean value of residuals, and the prediction accuracy of each model needs to befurther verified.

5.2Identification of Spindle Running State
Set the sliding window width Nas 10, increment qas 1 to calculate C(N), and then take αas
0.05, according to the small probability principle, the confidence level is 99.95%, based on Eq. (13) to
calculate Cthas 0.5660. The SCADA monitoring data of the unit for 10 days before the occurrence of
fault is selected as the abnormal condition test data, and the SCADA monitoring data of the unit for
10 days of normal operation is selected as the normal condition test data. After normalizing the test

data into the combined model for prediction, when C(N) is continuously above the threshold value
of 0.5660 for three or more times, it is judged as an abnormal state. The identification results of thespindle speed operation state index during the spindle operation of the unit are shown in Fig. 7 .
Figure 7: The result of spindle speed operation state index identification
As shown in Fig. 7a , the spindle speed operation status index of this set is 0.4563 at the maximum
value within the normal state test data set, and the whole are below the threshold value of 0.5660,so that the spindle confined in the normal operation state. In Fig. 7b , the results obtained from the
abnormal state test data set containing the spindle fault data of the wind turbine are illustrated. Thespindle speed operation state index of the wind turbine continuously breaks the threshold value andemits an early warning at the 1384th data point of the data set, and later breaks the threshold value andcontinues to be higher than the threshold value at the 1418th data point, in which the spindle of thewind turbine fails and is consistent with the actual fault data, It indicates that the failure alert time ofthe monitoring method in this work is 5.7 h earlier than the actual failure occurrence time, which canachieve the purpose of identifying and alerting the abnormal state of wind turbine spindle operation.
6Conclusions
In order to address the difficulty of collecting fault data from in-service wind turbine SCADA
system, this work proposed a research approach for wind turbine spindle operation status drivenentirely by SCADA normal data. At first, the QM-DBSCAN process is employed to clean the SCADAraw data and extract the feature parameters with the spindle speed as the output parameter. Thenext, ELM, SVR, Elman and combined prediction models were constructed based on the R languageplatform, and the combined prediction model was obtained as optimal with evaluation indexes

with each single model. RMSE was reduced by 0.0055, 0.0084 and 0.0017, correspondingly. MAE

and 0.0642% from the single model. At the last, the spindle operation status early warning threshold iscomputed and verified with actual SCADA data based on the assumption of small probability events.Such system can detect potential failures and alert in advance, which has implications for wind turbinespindle running condition recognition and maintenance.
