Abstract. This paper presents a review of existing theory and practice relating to main bearings for wind tur-
bines. The main bearing performs the critical role of supporting the turbine rotor, with replacements typically
requiring its complete removal. The operational conditions and loading for wind turbine main bearings deviate
signiﬁcantly from those of more conventional power plants and other bearings present in the wind turbine power
train, i.e. those in the gearbox and generator. This work seeks to thoroughly document current main-bearing
theory in order to allow for appraisal of existing design and analysis practices, while also seeking to form a solid
foundation for future research in this area. The most common main-bearing setups are presented along with stan-
dards for bearing selection and rating. Typical loads generated by a wind turbine rotor, and subsequently reacted
at the main bearing, are discussed. This is followed by the related tribological theories of lubrication, wear and
associated failure mechanisms. Finally, existing techniques for bearing modelling, fault diagnosis and prognosis
relevant to the main bearing are presented.
1 Introduction
In 2017 Europe installed a record total of 16.8 GW of addi-
tional wind power capacity, bringing the net total installed
capacity to 168.7 GW (Wind Europe, 2017). Wind energy
is therefore playing a key role in the decarbonisation of the
power sector and so also to the effort to avoid catastrophic
climate change. In order to ensure the continued success and
growth of the wind industry, the economic viability of wind
installations must be maintained. Crucial to this is the re-
liability of wind turbines and their subcomponents, an area
which overall has received a lot of attention.
The motivation for this current review is the observation
that the wind industry has identiﬁed wind turbine main-
bearing (WTMB) failures as being a critical issue in terms
of increasing wind turbine (WT) reliability and availabil-
ity. Recently reported ﬁgures show that main-bearing (MB)
failure rates (over a 20-year lifetime) can be as high as30 % (Hart et al., 2019). Additionally, industry experts at
the 2016 WT Drivetrain Reliability Collaborative Workshop
(Keller et al., 2016) consistently identiﬁed the MB as be-
ing the second most important reliability challenge after WT
gearboxes in a diverse range of areas, including MB failure
modes, standards and certiﬁcation, modelling and measure-
ment of internal axial motion, condition monitoring tech-
niques, and lubrication. Perhaps surprisingly, given this re-
cent spotlight on MB failures, WTMBs have received much
less attention in the research literature than other drivetrain
components. This is likely due to the fact that historically
the MB has not been reported as resulting in high rates of
failure. For example, prominent and often-cited reliability
studies (Carroll et al., 2016; Hahn et al., 2006; Wilkinson
et al., 2011; Spinato et al., 2009) either neglect the MB en-
tirely or appear to lump it in with other components under
the heading of “drivetrain”, “main shaft” or “other”, obscur-
ing contributions from the MB itself. These works are often

simply reporting the information available to them, and so
in turn it seems likely that the MB has not been prioritised
in terms of logging failures and considering root cause. This
might indicate that MB failures are becoming more of a prob-
lem as WTs increase in size; however, there is currently no
openly available data with which to test such a hypothesis.
As suggested in Hart et al. (2019), there therefore seems to
be a signiﬁcant MB knowledge gap which includes failure
data, modelling, measurements and design standards. This is
in stark contrast to the hundreds of papers in the literature
which consider all aspects of WT gearboxes and generators.
The current review seeks to aid the closing of this gap by
documenting existing literature which considers, or is rele-
vant to, WTMBs. It is intended that this will form a solid
foundation which both motivates and supports much needed
future work in this area.
The MB is somewhat of an anomaly in terms of WT driv-
etrain components owing to the fact that it directly interacts
with both the rotor, and associated wind ﬁeld dynamics and
aerodynamically induced loads, and the other rotating com-
ponents located further down the drivetrain. As such, the
MB sits at an interface between various diverse disciplines,
including wind ﬁeld dynamics, WT operation and control,
mechanics and loading of rotating machines, and tribologi-
cal failure mechanisms. The relationship between these var-
ious factors which contribute to MB lifetime are captured
in Fig. 1. At (A), interactions between the wind ﬁeld and
turbine controller generate loads across the rotor which are
then reacted by the MB unit, as shown in (B). This in turn
leads to the internal load conditions experienced by bear-
ing rollers and raceways, shown in (C), the characteristics of
which drive tribological mechanisms which ultimately lead
to damage and failure of MB components, shown in (D). This
review will therefore proceed in a manner which mirrors the
ﬂow of cause and effect seen in Fig. 1, outlining both under-
lying theory and documented results in order to help facil-
itate cross-disciplinary understanding with respect to these
various stages.
Section 2 gives a brief overview of wind turbine technol-
ogy and outlines the cases under consideration in the current
work. Section 3 considers wind ﬁeld structure, rotor loading,
and operation and control, i.e. aspects of (A) in Fig. 1. Sec-
tion 4 then outlines the most common choices for MB conﬁg-
uration and rolling elements. The modelling of bearing androller loads, (B) and (C) in Fig. 1, is presented in Sect. 5. Sec-
tion 6 details the tribological mechanisms which lead to MB
damage and failure, (D) in Fig. 1, and then Sect. 7 outlines
the standards which govern MB design and certiﬁcation. Fi-
nally, Sect. 8 provides an overview of the existing literature
on MB fault diagnosis and prognosis.
This paper focuses on rolling element bearings since this is
the current technology used in all operational WTMBs. It is
worth noting that journal (i.e. sliding) bearings are also being
investigated in terms of MB applications (Kasiri et al., 2019;
Schröder et al., 2019), but these systems are still in the R & D
phases at present.
2 Wind turbines
While historically there have been various designs for wind
turbines, the technology has now standardised to consist al-
most universally of three-bladed horizontal axis machines
(Burton et al., 2011). Furthermore, for reasons of improved
efﬁciency and control, these machines tend to have variable
speed and be pitch regulated. The rotational speed is var-
ied when operating in wind speeds corresponding to below
rated power in order to maintain optimal aerodynamic ef-
ﬁciency. Once rated power is reached, normally at around
12 m s 1wind speed, rotational speed is held constant and
the blades pitch as wind speeds increase further in order to
prevent power and loads exceeding design limits. There is
a general trend of upscaling for wind turbine installations,
with larger machines appearing each year. This trend is cap-
tured in Fig. 2 which shows yearly average rotor diameters
and power ratings for wind turbines in Germany and the US
from 2006 to 2018. Drivetrain choices have proved an area
for which a consensus on optimal design has not yet been
reached, the main split relevant to the current work being be-
tween geared and direct-drive (DD) machines. Geared ma-
chines use a gearbox to step up the slow rotational speed
of the turbine rotor to the fast (around 1800 rpm) rotational
speed needed to generate electricity using conventional gen-
erator technology. The gearbox is a complex piece of ma-
chinery which has traditionally been seen as a fault-prone
component that reduces overall reliability. In response to this,
DD machines were developed. These remove the gearbox
entirely and, in order to be able to generate at slow rota-
tional speeds, have increased generator diameters and operat-

ing torques. But, this switch to low-speed generation comes
with associated increases in cost, size and weight, and so the
optimal solution is still an open question, especially consid-
ering increasing reliabilities of geared machines. This work
will consider both drivetrain types for review.
3 The incident wind ﬁeld and main-bearing input
loads
The principal role performed by the MB is that of support-
ing the rotor while reacting non-torque loads either indepen-
dently, preventing them being transmitted further down the
drivetrain, or in combination with the gearbox and mounts.
A thorough understanding of WTMB science requires an ap-
preciation of the loading being reacted at the MB. Therefore,
the various components which contribute to MB loads, along
with their associated characteristics, are presented and dis-
cussed in the current section. Incident loads at the MB are
those transmitted from the WT rotor to the hub and then
passed through the cantilevered low-speed shaft (LSS) to the
MB itself. Loading across the rotor is in turn determined by
the structure of the incident wind ﬁeld. This characterisation
of MB input loads therefore begins with a general discussion
of wind ﬁeld structure. Hub loads resulting from rotor inter-
actions with the wind ﬁeld, and subsequently reacted at the
MB via the LSS, are then considered.
3.1 The incident wind ﬁeld
Wind turbines generate electricity by interacting with the on-
coming wind ﬁeld. These ﬂow ﬁelds tend to be turbulent
and complex, containing various structures of differing fre-
quency and magnitude, all of which contribute to the load-
ing imparted to the wind turbine and its components. There
are many excellent treatises which cover this topic in detail
(Mann, 1998; Brand et al., 2011; Stevens and Meneveau,
2017) and so rather than being exhaustive, the present sec-
tion seeks only to give a general overview of the aspectsof this topic which are most relevant to rotor and, therefore,
MB loading.
3.1.1 A homogeneous wind ﬁeld
Ignoring physical effects, such as ground and structural inter-
actions (these will be discussed below), a wind ﬁeld can be
described as a spatially coherent turbulent ﬂow. Turbulence
refers to short timescale variations in local wind speed, usu-
ally over about 10 min or less. In order to give a feel for wind
ﬁeld structure, the most common approaches to their being
characterised and modelled will be outlined.
The overall wind ﬁeld is often interpreted as consisting of
turbulent ﬂuctuations superimposed onto slower, larger-scale
ﬂuctuations such as those related to changing temperatures
or weather patterns (Burton et al., 2011). The most common
measure of turbulence level is turbulence intensity , deﬁned
as
IDu
u; (1)
whereuanduare the mean and standard deviations of wind
speed measurements, usually over a 10 min period. Spatial
coherence, in the wind ﬁeld deﬁnition given above, refers to
the fact that wind speeds at points separated in space through-
out the wind ﬁeld are not independent of one another. This
is due to wind being a viscous medium, along with the fact
that some wind ﬁeld structures can be fairly large, even with
respect to the size of modern wind turbine rotors. The turbu-
lent structure of wind ﬁeld ﬂuctuations at a point are char-
acterised in frequency space by an autospectral density func-
tion,Su(n), forna frequency in hertz. The two standard mod-
els forSu(n) are the Kaimal and von Kármán spectra (Burton
et al., 2011). A coherence function then determines the rate
at which correlations between turbulent ﬂuctuations decay as
a function of separation, , in space. For both spectra men-
tioned above, coherence models, C(,n), generally take the
form of a decaying exponential (Burton et al., 2011),
C(;n)Dexp( h(n)); (2)
whereh(n) is a monotonically increasing function of n, spec-
iﬁed differently for each turbulence model realisation. Mann
(1998) has also developed a turbulence model using a three-
dimensional tensor representation of turbulent spectra. This
model removes the assumption, implicit for the other two,
that the turbulence components in the horizontal, lateral and
vertical directions are independent of one another. This is
mentioned for completeness; for the purposes of the current
paper it is a general appreciation of turbulent wind ﬁeld struc-
ture which is of principal importance.
3.1.2 Physical interactions
–Wind shear . In reality a wind ﬁeld will never be per-
fectly homogeneous, in large part due to the friction

interactions of the wind with the non-smooth surface
of the earth. This results in a sheared ﬂow, with wind
speeds increasing with height. For neutrally stable wind
ﬁelds it has been shown that wind shear can be modelled
well as (Burton et al., 2011)
u(z)/ln(z=z0); (3)
at heightzand for roughness length z0. Roughness
length is a parameter which reﬂects the size of sur-
face asperities at a given site. Its values range from
about 0.001 for a ﬂat desert or rough sea to 0.7 m for
a city or forest (Burton et al., 2011). The relationship is
commonly approximated using a power-law shear pro-
ﬁle,
u(z)/z: (4)
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and
Germanischer Lloyd (GL) standards (IEC, 2016; GL,
2010, 2012) specify values of of 0.2 for normal on-
shore and 0.14 for normal offshore conditions. How-
ever, values of of up to 0.6 have been recorded (Hart
et al., 2016).
–Tower shadow . In addition to considering the structure
of the wind ﬁeld itself, it is important to consider the
impacts of placing a wind turbine into the air ﬂow. With
respect to blade and hub loading on a wind turbine rotor,
a signiﬁcant effect is due to tower shadow, this being the
blocking effect caused by the tower on the wind ﬂow
directly in front of the structure (Dolan and Lehn, 2006).
The result is a signiﬁcant drop in wind speed seen by
each blade as it passes the tower. This in turn will impact
the dynamic loading across the rotor, and so also the
loads incident on the MB.
–Yaw error . Wind turbines can pivot about the tower top
in order to ensure the rotor is always facing into the
wind. However, it is well known that there are com-
monly errors in this process, leading to the turbine not
facing directly into the wind ﬁeld (Micallef and Sant,
2016). These yaw errors can result from faulty measure-
ments, bad calibration or simply time lag between the
wind changing direction and the turbine following, due
to the relatively slow yaw mechanism. From an aerody-
namic point of view this results in local wind speeds and
blade inﬂow which change with azimuth angle about the
rotor. As with the previous phenomena, this will result
in time-varying rotor, and so also hub, loads (Micallef
and Sant, 2016).
–Turbine wakes . A wind turbine produces electricity by
extracting energy from the incident wind ﬂow. This
manifests itself as a slowing of the wind passing throughthe rotor as kinetic energy is removed from the ﬂow1.
The resulting velocity deﬁcit behind the turbine then
persists as the ﬂow travels further into the wind farm
and this is the wind turbine wake. A turbine wake will
slowly expand and recover as it moves further through
the wind ﬁeld due to pressure change and turbulent en-
ergy exchange from higher in the ﬂow (Stevens and
Meneveau, 2017). However, this recovery process will
generally only be partial with respect to standard wind
turbine array spacing and depends on various aspects
of the wind ﬁeld such as turbulence levels and atmo-
spheric stability (Stevens and Meneveau, 2017). Sub-
sequent rows of turbines in a wind farm will there-
fore have inﬂow which includes superimposed wakes
from upstream turbines. The dynamics and modelling
of wind turbine wakes and the implications for turbine
loading and performance are a vast subject which is
still very much under investigation (Archer et al., 2018;
Adaramola and Krogstad, 2011).
3.1.3 More complex wind structures
Other structures can be present in a wind ﬁeld, either caused
by more complex physical interactions or inherent to the
wind ﬁeld itself. The former of these includes complex ter-
rain in close proximity to a wind turbine; for example hills,
valleys or forests can all signiﬁcantly alter the ﬂow regime.
Inherent wind ﬁeld structure can also deviate signiﬁcantly
from the standard representations outlined above. Examples
of this include veered ﬂow (a shear-like effect where wind
direction changes with height rather than wind speed), co-
herent turbulence phenomena (Kelley et al., 2005) and low-
level jets (Gutierrez et al., 2014, 2017). As with wind turbine
wakes, the development of theory to model and relate these
phenomena to turbine loading and performance is ongoing.
3.2 Hub loading
WT hub loading results from a combination of aerody-
namic, gravitational and inertial loads on the rotor (Burton
et al., 2011), with signiﬁcant contributions coming from ro-
tor weight and blade loading. The forces (as opposed to mo-
ments) acting on the hub will be dominated by the rotor
weight acting vertically and the thrust force in the down-
wind direction. In addition, each blade is exposed to both
in-plane and out-of-plane loading (with respect to the rotor
plane), and so generate moments at the blade root in addition
to their force contributions. With respect to a rotating refer-
ence frame2in which each blade-root moment is expressed
1Technically, at the rotor itself it is in fact a pressure energy
which is extracted; however, the net effect relevant to the current
work is the resulting velocity deﬁcit.
2The reference frame used here is that of the original source and
was kept for the sake of consistency. In general the GL coordinate
system (GL, 2010) is more commonly used.

with axes set perpendicular and parallel to the given blade
(see Fig. 3), the resultant out-of-plane moments on the hub
can be expressed as follows for a three-bladed rotor (Burton
et al., 2011):

These equations result from projecting each of the MYionto
the relevant hub moment and summing the results3. For ex-
ample, the projection of MY2ontoMYHcan be seen to be
 cos(60)MY2D 1
2MY2. Similarly, the projection of MY3
ontoMZHis cos(30)MY3Dp
3
2MY3. The remaining terms
contained in the hub moment equations follow along the
same lines. Furthermore, rewriting the blade moments as
ﬂuctuations about a stationary mean (identical for each blade
in a ﬁxed or slowly varying wind proﬁle),
MYiDMYC1MYi; (7)
observes that inputting these new expressions into Eqs. (5)
and (6) results in the mean values cancelling (since the co-
efﬁcients of the identical MYterms will sum to zero); hence
the resultant hub moments can be seen to mainly be driven by
blade-root moment ﬂuctuations about the spatial mean over
the rotor circumference.
The aerodynamic blade loads which generate the MYican
be decomposed into deterministic and stochastic compo-
nents, relating to the physical and turbulent wind ﬁeld com-
ponents of Sect. 3.1 respectively.
3Note that for a three-bladed turbine the angle between neigh-
bouring blades is 120.3.2.1 Deterministic aerodynamic hub loads
Deterministic aerodynamic loads on the rotor result from ro-
tation in a wind ﬁeld which varies spatially due to shear pro-
ﬁle, tower shadow, yaw error, etc. The resulting load ﬂuc-
tuations on each blade have a frequency which corresponds
to the rotational speed of the turbine, . From the point
of view of hub loads in a ﬁxed reference frame, a single
rotation sees all blades make a full pass through the wind
ﬁeld, and hence the load frequency for the hub is that of the
blades increased by a factor of n, the number of blades. For a
three-bladed turbine the deterministic component of hub load
ﬂuctuations therefore corresponds to 3 . In this case, deter-
ministic ﬂuctuations in blade-root moments, 1MYi, resulting
from wind shear and yaw misalignment can often be reason-
ably well approximated as sinusoids with phase shifts of 0,
120 and 240(Burton et al., 2011). From Eqs. (5) and (6)
it follows that, in the case of sinusoidal load variations on
a three-bladed turbine, blade-root bending moments with
rangeMrange result in hub moment ﬂuctuations of 1 :5Mrange.
Note, the easiest way to see this result is to plot the two func-
tionsf1(x)Dsin(x) 1=2(sin(xC240)Csin(xC120)) and
f2(x)Dp
3=2(sin(xC240) sin(x)), both of which vary be-
tween 1.5 and 1:5 and so have ranges which are 1.5 times
that of sin(x). The above claim for moment ﬂuctuations is
then simply a scaled version of this same example. The very
localised variation in blade loads caused by tower shadow
will then further increase the load range seen at the hub.
Along with 3peaks in the hub load spectra, one would also
expect to see associated harmonics of these (6 , 9, . . . ),
along with a peak at itself caused by small manufacturing
differences between blades. It should be noted that the mo-
ment introduced to the turbine shaft from the gravitational
force acting at the hub will be opposed by the overturning
moment caused by wind shear.
3.2.2 Stochastic aerodynamic hub loads
The wind ﬁeld itself is non-stationary, turbulent and continu-
ally evolving. These wind ﬁeld variations will therefore lead
to variations in the turbine hub loads and moments. Taking
moments about an axis parallel to one of the three blades;
e.g.MZH, the expression for hub moment variance reduces
to a double integration across the other two blades and is
identical for both MZHandMYH(Burton et al., 2011). This
moment variance is given by (Burton et al., 2011)

uthe normalised cross-correlation function of the wind
ﬁeld. Crucially, this equation demonstrates the dependence
of hub moment ﬂuctuations on turbulence, wind ﬁeld struc-
ture and blade aerodynamic design. As in the deterministic
case, the interaction of turbine blades with stochastic fea-
tures in the evolving wind ﬁeld results in ﬂuctuating loads at
a frequency equal to the rotational speed multiplied by blade
number, and then also at associated harmonics.
3.2.3 Hub load spectra
In order to illustrate the load behaviours discussed in the pre-
vious sections, example hub load power spectra (in the sta-
tionary frame) are given in Figs. 4 and 5. These were gener-
ated using data from the simulation of a three-bladed 2 MW
wind turbine model in DNV GL Bladed aeroelastic software.
When studying spectra it is important to note that the ran-
dom nature of stochastic loading will spread the peak out
about its central value; hence, sharp peaks stem from deter-
ministic sources and wide peaks from stochastic ones. As dis-
cussed, both deterministic and stochastic sources drive load-
ing at multiples of 3 for a three-bladed turbine and so there
will be overlap between the different forms of excitation,
as can be seen in the ﬁgures. Note also some deterministic
force loading is present at a frequency which matches the
tower natural frequency and similarly for moments at a fre-
quency that corresponds to rotational speed. Note also that
Fxin Fig. 4 is thrust force on the hub. Thrust is reacted by
the MB along with out-of-plane forces and so a MB experi-
ences continuous variations in both axial and radial loads at
these speciﬁc frequencies.
3.3 Turbine operation and control
While wind turbine power generation is commonly discussed
in terms of above-rated and below-rated conditions, from
an operational standpoint each case breaks down into fur-

ther regions with distinct operational requirements. Figure 6
shows an example design trajectory of a variable-speed pitch-
regulated wind turbine as a function of torque and rota-
tional speed. The optimal efﬁciency tracking region and ini-
tial point of pitching can be seen, along with constant speed
transition regions. This diagram highlights the fact that there
are various regions of wind turbine operation with differ-
ent design trajectories and associated wind speeds; hence,
the load characteristics for the MB will also be different in
each case. An additional operating case not seen here is the
shutting down of a turbine in above-rated conditions when
wind speeds consistently stay above a design limit of around
25 m s 1. Wind turbine operation can additionally include
measures to meet certain performance or grid support stan-
dards, such as power curtailment or emergency stops. For a
detailed discussion of turbine operation and control regions
see Hart (2018).

E. Hart et al.: A review of wind turbine main bearings 111
Having outlined various regions/types of wind turbine op-
eration, it is important to note that achieving these opera-
tional requirements is then a control task. Like in other in-
dustrial applications, wind turbine controllers measure how
close to the design trajectory the machine is at a given time
and, in cases of deviation, take control action to remove any
error. For example, in above-rated pitch operation the power
is measured and the blades pitched in the appropriate direc-
tion if the power is found to be either above or below its
rated value. There are many types of wind turbine controller
(Novaes Menezes et al., 2018), and each turbine must have a
controller tuned to its speciﬁc dynamics. As well as follow-
ing a design trajectory or curtailing the turbine, modern con-
trollers are increasingly required to perform additional tasks
such as load alleviation for blades and tower, the provision of
grid frequency support, and damping of system resonances
(Hart, 2018). These various tasks can be achieved using a
range of advanced control techniques including the power
adjusting controller (PAC) (Stock, 2015), individual pitch
control (IPC) and individual blade control (IBC) (Bossanyi,
2003; Han and Leithead, 2015) among others. Each of these
control approaches will alter the behaviour of the turbine
with respect to an incident wind ﬁeld and so in turn will im-
pact the loads seen at the hub and MB. To date there have
been no studies which evaluate the impacts of different oper-
ation and control approaches to MB loads beyond consider-
ing stops and emergency stops (Scott et al., 2012).
As can be seen in Fig. 6, the LSS rotational speeds seen
by an operating wind turbine are slow, with speciﬁc ranges
being dependent on size and other design considerations. It
is also worth noting that rotational speeds tend to decrease as
turbine size increases; this is in order to preserve the optimal
ratio between blade tip speed and the incoming wind speed.
4 Main-bearing conﬁgurations and rolling elements
Wind turbine drivetrains have a number of possible con-
ﬁgurations depending on various factors, the most promi-
nent of these being whether the turbine utilises a gearbox or
not. In addition to this consideration, there are loading and
cost considerations which drive layout decisions; although
of the standard designs there is currently no consensus as to
whether one or the other is optimal in all cases.
Decisions relating to the use, or not, of a gearbox in the
wind turbine largely come down to ﬁnancial factors and
trade-offs between capital cost, weight, reliability, maintain-
ability and the OEM’s (original equipment manufacturer)
existing expertise. Historically a majority of variable speed
wind turbines have used doubly fed induction generator tech-
nology with a multistage gearbox (Polinder et al., 2005).
Gearboxes, however, manifest relatively high failure rates
and so lost revenue due to downtimes and repairs has become
a major concern of the wind energy industry (Su et al., 2017;
Dabrowski and Natarajan, 2015). New systems have there-fore been developed which require gearboxes with fewer
stages or are direct-drive (DD), removing the gearbox com-
pletely. DD systems are generally more expensive in terms
of capital cost due to having large associated dimensions,
weight and generators with high torque ratings. However,
with no gearbox the component with the highest failure rate
has been removed and so these turbines tend to be more re-
liable than their geared counterparts. As mentioned above,
no consensus yet exists as to which generator type is opti-
mal; notably Siemens Gamesa have committed exclusively
to DD technology for all their European offshore turbines in
future, so too have GE with their offshore offerings. How-
ever, Vestas are going with medium- and low-speed gearbox
technology.
4.1 Geared turbines
The most common drivetrain conﬁgurations for geared tur-
bines are those with three-point orfour-point suspensions,
referring to turbines with either a single-main-bearing (SMB)
or double-main-bearing (DMB) setup respectively (Guo
et al., 2016). Examples of these two conﬁgurations are shown
in Fig. 7, diagrams A and B. A SMB layout requires gear-
box trunnions to react loads at the gearbox end of the LSS,
and so in combination there are three points of support. This
setup has been used in commercial wind turbines by GE,
Siemens (prior to becoming Siemens Gamesa), Nordex and
Vestas for machines rated at between 1.5 and 3 MW (Guo
et al., 2016). For the DMB layout, a second bearing is placed
near the gearbox end of the LSS in an attempt to react non-
torque loads before they reach the gearbox. This latter setup
has been used in commercial wind turbines by Gamesa (prior
to becoming Siemens Gamesa), Vestas and GE for machines
rated at between 2 and 2.5 MW (Guo et al., 2016). DMB de-
signs protect the gearbox more fully from non-torque loads;
however, they can be sensitive to misalignment, require more
space and have a higher associated capital cost (Bergua et al.,
2014; Guo et al., 2016).
Designs have also been implemented which integrate the
MB directly into the gearbox, removing the need for a main
shaft and so resulting in a very compact overall design. Such
a design is shown in Fig. 7C. The beneﬁts of such an ar-
rangement lie mainly in the resulting reduction in tower-top
weight, allowing for cost savings in the WT tower and sub-
structures (Terrell et al., 2012). However, drawbacks have
also been identiﬁed including possible early failures due to
incompatibilities between the gearbox and remaining nacelle
components (to which the gearbox is now a main load path)
(Terrell et al., 2012), noise issues from vibro-acoustic prop-
agation, the potential for poor load distributions across gear
faces (Bergua et al., 2014) and, perhaps most importantly, the
fact that a MB failure in the fully integrated design case re-
quires the entire nacelle to be exchanged. This drivetrain con-
ﬁguration has been used by both Vestas and Areva in 3 and
5 MW wind turbines respectively (Bergua et al., 2014).

Figure 7. Depictions of the existing drivetrain layouts for geared turbines. In alphabetical order these are single main bearing, double main
bearing, gearbox-integrated main bearing and a “ﬂoating drivetrain” design.
Another concept looks to decouple support structure
and drivetrain through the implementation of a “ﬂoating-
drivetrain” design. Two MBs support the rotor as it ro-
tates about a structure ﬁxed directly to the turbine bedplate
(Bergua et al., 2014). Torque is then transmitted to the shaft
via an elastic coupling towards the front of the turbine hub,
as in Fig. 7D. The principal drivers for this design are the
removal of non-torque loads from being propagated into the
gearbox and generator; however, load improvements for the
MBs themselves are also claimed to result from a more even
distribution of loads due to the rotor centre of gravity now
presiding between the bearings (Bergua et al., 2014). While
this may be the case, no published studies exist which speciﬁ-
cally investigate resulting loads on the MBs themselves from
such a design, although, as will be discussed, this is true in
general for all drivetrain layouts. Published ﬁgures do show
low gearbox failure rates for this drivetrain design (Bergua
et al., 2014), but similar ﬁgures are not available for the MBs.
This design has been used in Alstom turbines for a range of
power ratings and will also be used in GE offshore DD in-
stallations, as discussed below.
4.2 Direct-drive turbines
Current DD wind turbines are almost all radial ﬂux machines,
although axial ﬂux topologies do also exist (Dubois et al.,
2000). This work therefore considers the more common ra-
dial ﬂux design. Given the integration of support structure
and generator in DD turbines, a main design aim becomes en-
suring that the speciﬁed minimum air-gap clearance is main-
tained (Stander et al., 2012). This precision task is therefore
additionally required of the MBs, along with the transfer of
torque and reaction of non-torque loads. Bearings can be ar-ranged in single, double or triple conﬁgurations, with various
possible layouts in each case (Stander et al., 2012), includ-
ing having bearings in the air-gap clearance. Figure 8 shows
one example of each; for a full accounting see Stander et al.
(2012). The ﬂoating-drivetrain concept introduced for geared
turbines can also be applied in DD cases and is currently be-
ing used in GE’s 6 MW offshore wind turbine.
Maintainability was mentioned above as being a key driver
for drivetrain selection at the design stage. Section 4.1 con-
tained a clear example of this with respect to fully integrated
drivetrains requiring the entire nacelle to be exchanged in
the case of a main-bearing failure. This is a more extreme
example but it highlights the point that the maintainability
of a given system will play an important role in determining
its overall viability. From a maintenance point of view, more
modular concepts tend to allow for easier component acces-
sibility and exchange. Partially integrated designs have also
been introduced as a way of trying to secure the beneﬁts of
both design philosophies (Gasch and Twele, 2012).
4.3 Rolling elements
The current section gives an overview of the bearing rolling
elements used in WTMBs for the various conﬁgurations of
the previous section. These rolling elements are depicted in
Fig. 9.
–Spherical roller bearings (SRBs) . SRBs are charac-
terised by their outer raceway being a portion of a
sphere. The rollers, in turn, are shaped such that they
conform closely to both inner and outer raceways. This
results in a bearing which is internally self-aligning
and has a high radial load carrying capacity. A double-
row SRB (DSRB) conﬁguration, as in the ﬁgure, allows

triple-MB design.
for the reaction of combined axial and radial loading.
SRBs cannot support moment loads in either single- or
double-row conﬁgurations (Harris and Kotzalas, 2007).
–Tapered roller bearings (TRBs) . A single-row TRB can
carry a combination of axial and radial loads. Differ-
ences in contact angles at the inner and outer raceways
result in an unbalanced force which will act to drive the
roller against its guide ﬂange. The bearing contact angle
is determined by the magnitude of axial loading to be
reacted, relative to radial loading. As with SRBs, TRBs
are commonly put into double-row (or more) conﬁgura-
tions (DTRB) in order to increase their radial load car-
rying capacity. TRBs and DTRBs can support moment
loads (Harris and Kotzalas, 2007). Numerical modelling
has shown the stiffness and displacement of rollers to be
sensitive to the magnitude of applied moment and radial
loads (Tong and Hong, 2014).
–Cylindrical roller bearings (CRBs) . CRBs have cylin-
drical rollers, usually crowned at the ends to prevent
high edge stresses. They exhibit low-friction operation
compared to SRBs and TRBs and have a high radial
load capacity; however, they are unable to support ax-
ial loads. Tolerance to small axial loads can be achieved
by incorporating a thrust ﬂange into the bearing hous-
ing. As previously, a double row (DCRB) may be used
to increase load carrying capacity (Harris and Kotzalas,
2007).
–Toroidal roller bearings (TorRBs) . Similar to SRBs, but
with a toroidal outer raceway and elongated rollers by
comparison, TorRBs offer an increased radial load car-
rying capacity while also retaining some of the self-
aligning properties of SRBs. TorRBs can only support
small axial loads.
Having outlined common roller types and their typical con-
ﬁgurations, we will now detail which bearings are used in
Figure 9. Bearing rolling element types. A single row only is shown
for each. Note that for SRBs and TRBs, in WTMB applications, a
double-row back-to-back conﬁguration will generally be used on
the rotor side.
the various drivetrain setups. Two important concepts nec-
essary for this discussion are locating/non-locating bearings
andpre-loading .
When two or more bearings are being used to support
a shaft, in order to prevent excessive axial motion one or
both bearings must be ﬁxed in the axial direction. However,
changes in temperature during operation (either machine re-
lated or due to external inﬂuences) will result in thermal ex-
pansions which, in the case of two axially ﬁxed bearings,
would lead to material stress and deformation. It is therefore
generally necessary to have one bearing which is free in the
axial direction and so able to accommodate axial displace-
ments (the non-locating bearing) and one which is axially
ﬁxed in order to hold the shaft in place (the locating bear-
ing).
Radial pre-loading of roller bearings is used to increase
the number of rolling elements under load around the bearing
circumference. This has the effect of reducing the maximum
rolling element load and helps prevent skidding4(Harris and
Kotzalas, 2007).

114 E. Hart et al.: A review of wind turbine main bearings
–Geared turbines . Geared turbines which have either a
SMB or DMB setup have historically most commonly
used a locating DSRB for the rotor-side bearing, along
with a SRB, CRB or DTRB as the generator-side bear-
ing (Yagi, 2004). The use of SRBs has remained preva-
lent, along with the introduction of designs featuring
two TRBs or a DTRB and CRB (at rotor side and gener-
ator side respectively) in the DMB drivetrain case (Yagi
and Ninoyu, 2008). More recently, SMB designs which
replace the rotor-side DSRB with a pre-loaded DTRB
or triple CRB have become available (Fierro, 2017;
Schaefﬂer, 2019; Liebherr, 2019). Finally, a design also
exists for the DMB case which uses a non-locating
TorRB and locating DSRB combination (SKF, 2019).
In the case where the MB is integrated into the turbine
gearbox both DTRB and triple CRB setups have been
used (Yagi, 2004; Bergua et al., 2014). The ﬂoating-
drivetrain design uses a spread pair of TRBs for rotor
support (Bergua et al., 2014).
–Direct-drive turbines . DD turbine mechanical MBs tend
to use TRBs, CRBs or TorRBs for rolling elements in
either single- or double-row formations at each support
point of the MB system (Stander et al., 2012). In the
case of a SMB with rollers located within the air gap,
disc-shaped rollers can be used which are supported by
a shaft and small mechanical bearings (Engstrom and
Lindgren, 2007).
5 Main-bearing modelling
As with other aspects of MB theory, there are not huge num-
bers of studies which deal speciﬁcally with the modelling of
WTMBs. However, there is a substantial literature concerned
with the modelling of rolling bearings of different types and
under various conditions. This section will therefore outline
both the existing modelling work concerned with WTMBs
and relevant contributions from the wider theory which seem
likely to play a role in future MB research.
5.1 Hertzian elastic contact theory
Many rolling bearing models are underpinned by Hertz’s
classical theory of local stress and deformation resulting
from two elastic bodies in point or line contact. An excellent
overview of this theory can be found in Harris and Kotzalas
(2007). The following general load–deﬂection relationship is
obtained from the classical theory,
QDKn; (9)
which relates normal contact force, Q, with the radial deﬂec-
tion,, at the contact. For a point contact nD3=2 and for
a line contact nD10=9. The constant factor, K, represents
contact stiffness and is determined from material properties
and the geometry of the contact patch which forms betweenthe bodies. Various analytical approximations have been de-
veloped (Antoine et al., 2006; Brewe and Hamrock, 1977)
which allow for fast evaluation of the terms necessary for de-
termining contact geometry and Kitself with minimal error.
Tangential forces due to friction and lubrication conditions
are then given by
QtDQ; (10)
whereis an equivalent friction coefﬁcient. In the case of
roller bearings, the surface will often not be a perfect cylin-
der and so assuming a line contact can lead to inaccuracies.
In order to avoid these errors it has been proposed that the
bearing should be partitioned into a number of slices , on each
of which a perfect line contact is assumed and the forces are
evaluated as above. The resultant contact force on the entire
roller is then a summation, or integration, of those on the
slices.
For an applied load resulting in deﬂection, the point of
maximum rolling element load coincides with the point of
maximum deﬂection. Loading at an angle of  from the max-
imum load,Qmax, can be evaluated as
Q DQmax
1 1
2(1 cos )n
: (11)
The parameter is related to clearance in the bearing and
the radial shift at the centre of the shaft. Its value can be
interpreted as giving the proportion of the total bearing cir-
cumference which is under load (Harris and Kotzalas, 2007).
Figure 1C shows an example radial load distribution for a
rolling element bearing with 0:5. Similar formulations
hold for cases of combined axial and radial loading.
5.2 Multibody models
Multibody formulations, modelling the bearing system as a
collection of interacting bodies, are most commonly used for
bearing models due to their speed and relative simplicity.
These models can be quasi-static or dynamic in nature. In
both cases, force expressions are determined which describe
loading–deﬂection relationships between the various bearing
components (rollers, races, ﬂanges, etc.), with contact loads
generally evaluated using the Hertz theory of the previous
section. Bearing internal loads and deﬂections are iteratively
solved for, using Newton–Raphson or similar equations, such
that external and bearing forces balance. For the quasi-static
case this gives the desired result at each time step. In the dy-
namic case, load and stiffness properties from this ﬁrst stage
can be used in a dynamic model to analyse rolling element
motion.
Ghalamchi et al. (2013) present a general purpose dy-
namic SRB model which follows the approach outlined
above. Computational efﬁciency is improved by assuming
that sliding does not occur between bearing components, all
rollers move around the raceway with equal velocity and do

not interact with each other, and isothermal conditions exist
throughout. Centrifugal forces acting on the rollers are also
neglected. Results from dynamic simulations of both single-
and double-bearing conﬁgurations are presented. Both Tong
and Hong (2014) and Zheng et al. (2018) develop models to
evaluate loading for TRBs subject to combined force and mo-
ment loads. The ﬁrst of these improved upon existing tech-
niques in terms of evaluating pressure distributions along
rollers via integration. The latter is speciﬁcally considering
TRBs for DD ﬂoating wind turbine main shafts and addi-
tionally includes effects related to angular misalignment and
friction, although cage inﬂuences and skew effects are still
neglected. Both models are quasi-static in nature. In Jain and
Hunt (2011) a dynamic model is derived with which the pres-
ence of bearing sliding or skidding (instead of rolling) can be
investigated. The model itself is developed for ball bearings
and so would need to be adapted before it can be applied in
the MB case; however, given that sliding is associated with
some potential MB damage modes (see Sect. 6) this would
seem to be a key point of investigation for future MB re-
search.
The multibody models presented here are all fairly gen-
eral, mainly differing in terms of considered bearing type
and assumptions made during the modelling process. The
fundamental building blocks are therefore present for further
development of models with which to investigate WTMB
loading for different bearing types and conﬁgurations. Dur-
ing this development it will be important to appraise the as-
sumptions of the given approaches in order to ensure that the
important factors in terms of MB operational loads are ac-
counted for, including a consideration of whether dynamic
or quasi-static models are required.
Both SKF and Schaefﬂer have developed their own multi-
body simulation softwares for design, testing and optimisa-
tion. SKF’s software, BEAST (BEAring Simulation Tool-
box), can evaluate internal motions and forces in a bearing
under speciﬁed loads. The model employs an elastohydro-
dynamic lubrication (EHL) lubrication model and can pre-
dict the occurrence of phenomena such as wear and fatigue.
Schaefﬂer have developed BEARINX, which offers similar
features and looks to account for lubricant condition and con-
tamination effects in the model. Similarly, Timken have their
own proprietary analysis system, Syber, which they use for
design optimisation and component selection. A commer-
cially available multibody modelling software, Simpack, has
been used to analyse MB loads at a number of operating
points, while also exploring the effects of bearing clearance
(Sethuraman et al., 2015). In Cardaun et al. (2019) a Simpack
model is used to investigate the impacts of yaw misalign-
ments on WTMB loads in terms of fatigue life. The results
indicate that misalignment increases the damage equivalent
loads for the MB, but that the effect is not symmetrical and
depends on the inﬂow direction.
In Hart et al. (2019) the loading experienced by WTMBs
is investigated using simple beam-support representations ofthe drivetrain5. Hub loadings taken from aeroelastic code are
used as inputs to models which represent three- and four-
point mount systems in order to compare the loads seen by
each. The results of this work indicate that radial loads seen
by four-point mount systems are generally higher than for
the three-point system, but they also saw a corresponding
reduction in axial-to-radial load ratios, a quantity for which
high values have been associated with potentially damaging
events such as unseating of rollers (Hart et al., 2019). Given
the reported higher instances of failures in three-point sys-
tems in this same work, it is suggested that speciﬁc loading
combinations (in terms of axial and radial loads) rather than
just individual load magnitudes may be important to under-
standing failures.
5.3 Finite-element models
Finite-element methods (FEMs) can be used for modelling of
the deformation pressure within a bearing. A function is cho-
sen to uniquely represent the displacement within each node.
Then, the element stiffness matrix is obtained from equilib-
rium, and upon obtaining the matrix for the complete bear-
ing, the full matrix is assembled and boundary conditions ap-
plied. The solution of the resulting matrix equation produces
the nodal displacements (Harris and Kotzalas, 2007). Accu-
racy of solutions is highly dependent on the number of nodes
and so considerable computational power and time are gen-
erally required for good results. Due to its extensive compu-
tational time and power required, FEM has mainly been used
in bearing applications for modelling of roller–raceway con-
tacts (Jackson and Green, 2005; Zeid and Padovan, 1981).
There are however also cases of full bearings being mod-
elled using these methods. For roller–raceway contact mod-
elling, calculations of the distribution and magnitude of sur-
face stresses can be carried out which include the effects of
roller and raceway crowning (Harris and Kotzalas, 2007).
Results are typically compared with Hertzian calculations
for validation. Full bearing modelling has been done to anal-
yse fatigue failure in wind turbine gearbox bearings (Grujicic
et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2015; Lai and Stadler, 2016) and in
one case for a WTMB under steady-state loads (Liang et al.,
2013), and also to understand contact loads within pitch or
yaw bearings (Chen and Wen, 2012). More recently, FEMs
have been used to understand load and pressure distributions
about WTMBs. In Kock et al. (2019) this is done with the aim
of understanding the effect contributed by elasticity in the
MB housing along with the applied load and bearing clear-
ance. Their results indicate that the elastic surroundings lead
to more rollers under load and hence a lower maximum load,
indicating that housing elasticity should be modelled to avoid
errors. With respect to the applied load it was found that load-
ing directions are important since the bearing mounts result
5These technically still fall under the heading of multibody, al-
though they are at the simpler end of this spectrum.

in variations in elasticity about the bearing circumference. Fi-
nally, increases in clearance were found to result in increased
bearing loads as fewer rollers are supporting the system. In
Reisch et al. (2018) modelling capabilities were investigated
by comparing results from an FEM of a 3 MW wind turbine
nacelle (including MB), with those coming from an experi-
mental test-bench research system of the same power rating.
In the model, bearing rolling elements are modelled by non-
linear spring elements. With respect to the MB, the investi-
gations consider interactions between the MB and gearbox
planet carrier. Good agreements between modelled and mea-
sured values are found in this case.
There exist various forms of commercially available FEM
software. Particularly relevant to the wind turbine case is Ro-
maxWIND, developed by Romax Technology and certiﬁed
by DNV GL for gear and shaft design analysis.
6 Tribological theory for wind turbine main bearings
Tribology is the science of interacting surfaces in relative
motion. As such, it is this discipline which is concerned with
the metallurgical effects of roller and raceway interactions in
rolling bearings and subsequent damage and failure mecha-
nisms. The current section seeks to outline the aspects of this
theory most relevant to WTMBs.
6.1 Lubrication
Lubrication is the separation and reduction of contact pres-
sure of two sliding or rolling contacts resulting from entrap-
ment of a liquid (or grease) into a converging gap at the con-
tacts (Halme and Andersson, 2010). Separation stems from a
hydrodynamic pressure and lubricant ﬁlm forming between
the contacts. The ratio of oil ﬁlm thickness to local rough-
ness on contacts is denoted and determines the mechanism
of lubrication. When <1 (boundary lubrication) the hydro-
dynamic action is not strong enough to separate the contact
surfaces and loads are mainly carried via solid–solid contact,
resulting in increased friction and wear (Halme and Ander-
sson, 2010). Various factors effect the value in practise
including the availability of oil, bearing surface roughness,
elastic deformation of the loaded surfaces, and the viscos-
ity and pressure–viscosity relationship of oils. Elastohydro-
dynamic lubrication (EHL) is a lubrication condition model
which takes these various factors into account. In EHL the oil
ﬁlm thickness is slightly higher than the overall contact sur-
face roughness, and so >1. Importantly, assumed condi-
tions of EHL underpin most bearing life calculations (Halme
and Andersson, 2010). Mixed lubrication occurs when 1
and a combination of boundary and EHL regimes are present.
When1 the sliding surfaces are completely separated by
a ﬂuid ﬁlm which is thick in comparison to surface rough-
ness. These conditions only generally occur at less heavily
loaded contact interfaces, such as those between a roller and
its cage or the roller end and bearing race ﬂange (Halmeand Andersson, 2010). For WTMBs the speciﬁc lubrica-
tion regimes at these traditionally moderately loaded contacts
have not been investigated directly, and hence it is possible
that there is divergence from the standard case.
Rolling elements inﬂuence the lubricating ﬁlm layer as
they pass. Roller motion ejects oil from the contact area, as
does centrifugal action in higher speed applications. Starva-
tion can occur if the oil reﬂow, back into the raceway, is too
slow to replenish the quantity of oil necessary for EHL be-
fore the next roller passes (Halme and Andersson, 2010). If a
liquid lubricant is used there needs to be some means of en-
suring oil ﬂow to contact regions. This can be done through
pumping or circulatory splash systems. Grease-lubricated
bearings are more likely to experience starved conditions as
grease is squeezed out of contact regions during roller pas-
sage (Halme and Andersson, 2010).
Oil vs. grease lubrication . Oil lubricants are typically em-
ployed for high-speed and high-temperature applications.
They require a system for circulation and, therefore, have
higher maintenance demands. However, they are known to
work better at cooling the lubricated surfaces. Grease, on the
other hand, is thickened oil. Its action allows localisation of
the lubricant to regions of contact within the bearing. It con-
sists of a suspension of ﬂuid dispersed into a soap or non-
soap thickener with the addition of a variety of performance-
enhancing additives (Harris and Kotzalas, 2007). Grease is
typically used in low-speed, low-temperature applications. It
requires less maintenance due to not requiring a circulation
system, and is typically the lubricant used in WTMBs. Pump-
ing systems are now employed for grease re-lubrication, re-
moving the need for manual re-greasing by an engineer up-
tower.
Grease has a more complex, two-phase lubrication mecha-
nism, namely the churning and bleeding phases (Lugt, 2016).
The churning phase starts when the bearing is lubricated with
fresh grease and is distinguished by macroscopic grease ﬂow.
After a period of operation ( 24 h), a large portion of the
grease will have been swept to the side of the rolling region.
During the churning phase there is a good supply of lubri-
cant and the contacts tend to remain ﬂooded. After the churn-
ing phase, macroscopic grease ﬂow stops and the supply of
lubricant into contacts takes place through bleeding ﬂow as
the grease releases oil through phase separation (Lugt, 2016).
When the moving parts of a bearing come into contact with
grease, a small quantity of thickened oil will adhere to the
bearing surfaces. The oil is then gradually lost through oxida-
tion or evaporation and with time the oil in grease within the
contact region will be depleted. The grease lubricant regime
is dependant on the balance of lubricant supply and loss
mechanisms which determine the ﬁlm thickness.
6.2 Damage and wear mechanisms
This section details the wear and damage mechanisms most
likely to effect WTMBs.

6.2.1 Classical fatigue
Dynamic contact conditions generate stress ﬁelds and plas-
tic deformation in contacting materials, eventually leading
to the formation of fatigue cracks at defects or inclusions in
the material structure (Halme and Andersson, 2010). Inter-
sections of such cracks lead to the formation of pits and the
releasing of abrasive particles into the bearing environment.
Once initiated this process will self propagate through sur-
face roughening, reduced contact areas and increasing lev-
els of abrasive wear. Roller bearing lifetimes, with respect
to classical fatigue, can be described statistically as a func-
tion of bearing design, load, speed and lubrication conditions
(Halme and Andersson, 2010). The basic formula for the life-
rating of a rolling bearing is
L10DC
Pp
; (12)
whereL10is in millions of revolutions, Cis the basic dy-
namic load rating, Pthe bearing equivalent load and pD
10=3 for roller bearings. L10gives the number of revolu-
tions that 90 % of a bearing population is expected to sur-
vive without experiencing fatigue pit formation (Halme and
Andersson, 2010). It is standard practise to modify this ba-
sic rating via the multiplication of scalars which account for
other factors including speed, oil viscosity, oil contamination
or a desired percentile other than 90 %. Hence the modiﬁed
life,Lnm, is used, which is proportional to L10,
Lnm/L10: (13)
Implicit to rolling bearing fatigue life prediction, using the
above formulations, are certain assumptions which it is im-
portant to be aware of. Those most pertinent to the current
work are as follows (Halme and Andersson, 2010):
–EHL conditions are assumed to hold throughout the
bearing lifetime.
–Present theory does not account for intermittent opera-
tion; most of the lifetime of a rolling bearing is assumed
to occur under steady-state conditions.
–These equations do not account for the presence of wear
instead of, or as well as, rolling contact fatigue.
6.2.2 Micro-pitting
Micro-pitting wear has been found to be present in doc-
umented cases of WTMB failures to date (Kotzalas and
Doll, 2010). Micro-pitting results from an insufﬁcient local
lubricant ﬁlm thickness (potentially resulting from exces-
sive loading or off-design operation) allowing interactions
between roller and race surface asperities. In these cases
the normal stresses, i.e. those accounted for in classical fa-
tigue analysis, are compounded by additional frictional shearstresses. Bulk contact stresses are therefore increased and
points of maximum stress move closer to the surface, leading
to signiﬁcant localised stresses beneath asperity contacts and
the subsequent formation of micro-pits (Kotzalas and Doll,
2010). Surface asperity interactions associated with this fail-
ure mechanism are generally found to occur in situations
where there is relative sliding between the contacting sur-
faces, in addition to the presence of an insufﬁcient lubricant
ﬁlm (Kotzalas and Doll, 2010).
6.2.3 Spalling
Spalling is the pitting or ﬂaking away of bearing material,
often as a result of some other primary damage mechanism
(Timken Company, 2015). Spalling can occur due to geo-
metric stress concentrations caused by misalignment or ex-
cessive loading and by high localised stresses resulting from
surface dents and damage or hard particle contamination.
Micro-pitting will commonly lead to spalling damage of the
effected surface (Kotzalas and Doll, 2010).
6.2.4 Smearing
Smearing is a form of adhesive wear which occurs under
sliding contact between two surfaces, involving the transfer
of material from one surface to the other. In rolling element
bearings this is known to occur in cases where roller rota-
tional speeds change rapidly, for example when a roller ac-
celerates on entering a more highly loaded bearing region
(R. D. Evans et al., 2013).
6.2.5 Abrasive wear and debris damage
The entrainment of hard particles into bearing contacts can
lead to physical damage, either from indentations left by
rolling particles or surface scratching due to sliding parti-
cles (Nilsson et al., 2006). Similarly, particles in the lubri-
cant, through contamination or abrasive damage of bearing
surfaces, can lead to high local stress ﬁelds and abrasive con-
ditions which can be worse than those seen in boundary-
lubricated regimes. Ductile metallic debris in the lubricant
can be rolled over and ﬂattened by rolling elements, leav-
ing larger shallow smooth dents. Brittle materials, such as
sand, fracture when rolled over and leave many small but
steep-sided dents. Debris damage of these types can lead to
fatigue crack formation and spalling (Nelias and Ville, 1999;
Ai, 2001). The presence of more brittle particulate contam-
ination can lead to abrasive wear and gradual increases in
bearing clearance (Nilsson et al., 2006; Dwyer-Joyce, 1999).
6.2.6 Fretting
Fretting corrosion occurs at interfaces where loads are
transferred under oscillating contact micromovements (ISO,
2017b), commonly a result of vibrations in the system. A

WTMB may be exposed to both blade and gearbox vibra-
tions and so this type of damage is possible (Yagi, 2004).
Prevention of this type of damage involves trying to optimise
bearing clearances and lubricant type.
6.3 Damage related to materials and manufacturing
Inclusions within bearing materials are known to increase
the risk of premature failures due to them acting as a nu-
cleation site for subsurface cracks and spalling (Jalalahmadi
et al., 2011; Lund, 2010; M. Evans et al., 2013); much ef-
fort has therefore been made to reﬁne steel-making process
in order to ensure a high level of bearing material homo-
geneity and cleanliness (Tabatabaei et al., 2018; Ni et al.,
2017; Michelic et al., 2011). As a consequence, the probabil-
ity of large non-metallic inclusions ( >5 µm) in small-sized
bearings is low. However, maintaining such levels of mate-
rial quality becomes more challenging in larger bearings, and
hence WTMBs may well have such inclusions present. Bear-
ing manufacturing defects such as improper dimensional tol-
erances, unequal diameters of rolling elements and design
ﬂaws can also result in premature bearing failures (ZKL,
2019; Nabhan et al., 2015). Manufacturing defects can also
potentially cause tight-ﬁtted bearings or bearings with incor-
rect outer or inner diameter tolerances. A tight-ﬁtted bearing
exceeding its radial design clearance will experience exces-
sive loads and overheating issues which both accelerate wear
and fatigue (Barden, 2019). On the other hand, bearings ﬁtted
loosely between the outer raceway and housing will experi-
ence slippage and potentially fretting, wearing out the outer
raceway surface (Barden, 2019). Finally, misalignment from
improper assembly can result in overloading, vibration and
overheating of bearings (He et al., 2012).
From the above descriptions it should be clear that most
of these damage mechanisms are self perpetuating, generally
leading to increasing amounts of similar damage. Further-
more, the presence of one can result in the initiation of oth-
ers, for example: micro-pitting !spalling!abrasive wear.
7 Design standards
There are several ISO standards which underpin wind tur-
bine bearing design speciﬁcations. ISO 76 (ISO, 2017a) deals
with static load ratings of conventional rolling element bear-
ings. This covers conventional design regarding the shape of
rolling contact surfaces and assumes double-row bearings to
be symmetrical. ISO 76 states that it is not satisfactory in
applications where the following is true.
–There is considerable truncation6of contact area be-
tween rolling elements and raceways.
6Truncation is where element–raceway contact moves to the
edge of the raceway, resulting in edge stresses, a smaller contact
area and overall increased contact pressure.–Application conditions cause deviations from a normal
load distribution in the bearing; this can be due to pre-
load, large clearance and surface treatments or coatings.
Bearings are generally designed to avoid truncation but oc-
currence can cause large reduction in MB life through ac-
celeration of many of the above damage mechanisms. Since
time-varying loads and large moments are present in the
WTMB case, it is possible that these effects are present
for wind turbines. ISO 281 (ISO, 2007) deals with dynamic
load ratings and rated life calculations for conventional roller
bearings where life is predominantly dependent on rolling
contact fatigue. The same limitations apply as those noted
above for ISO 76. In addition to this, the life calculations
in ISO 281 do not account for the inﬂuence of wear, corro-
sion or electrical erosion7(ISO, 2007). ISO/TS 16281 (ISO,
2008) then allows for effects resulting from tilting, mis-
alignment, clearances and internal load differences to be ac-
counted for in rolling contact fatigue life calculations.
The above ISO standards form the basis for bearing de-
sign and certiﬁcation in the turbine-speciﬁc standards by the
IEC and DNV GL. Both the IEC (IEC, 2016, 2013) and GL
(GL, 2010, 2012) standards for wind turbines require the use
of ISOs 76 and 281 in combination with simulated loads
across various operational cases. Additionally, both IEC and
GL standards reference ISO/TS 16281. While in both cases
the gearbox is given its own section, the MB is not considered
speciﬁcally in either set of standards. Furthermore, MB de-
sign and rolling element selection is made based on fatigue
life and static load ratings only. Design implications with re-
spect to the likelihood of other possible damage mechanisms,
i.e. those presented in the previous section, are not consid-
ered beyond potential adjustments to the modiﬁed life Lnm.
8 Fault diagnosis and prognosis
Rotating bearing monitoring is commonly done through the
analysis of vibration signals using either vibration accelera-
tion (V A) measurements or acoustic emissions (AEs). These
signals can then be analysed in either the time or frequency
domain. Commonly, a set of so-called characteristic features
– such as signal rms value, frequency component amplitudes
or statistical moments – are extracted which are then used
to relate the signal to previous operating data or known fault
cases. When a rolling element passes a local defect on the
race surface, an impulse is generated which will then re-
peat as further passes are made. The frequencies of these
events are dependent on bearing geometry, rotational speed
and the location of the defect. Similarly, a defect on a bear-
ing roller generate impulses as it moves around the bear-
ing circumference, which can be detected. The majority of
V A and AE methods which have been developed work well in

due to the presence of unintended electrical currents or voltages.

high-speed applications. However, as discussed previously,
WTMBs are components which operate at low speeds and
high loads. This has the effect of making them less sensi-
tive to vibrations as a result to defects or damage within the
bearing. Therefore, many of the techniques which work well
in high-speed and moderately loaded cases have been found
to be unreliable in this case. In addition, for the case of AE,
the size of the MB structure means that signals are very sus-
ceptible to attenuation and hence information loss, reducing
the usefulness of these data. Defect identiﬁcation challenges
resulting from the lower speed of the MB may be partially
mitigated by recording longer sampling periods of vibration
data. For example, a 10 s data acquisition period has been
found to be less successful in detecting low-speed bearing de-
fects than for high-speed bearing/gear tooth defects (Carroll
et al., 2019). This suggests that one cause of reduced detec-
tion rates for faults in low-speed bearings may therefore be
due to insufﬁcient sampling periods. Some techniques have
been proposed for MB fault detection which use vibration
signals; as will be outlined, these techniques tend to also re-
quire additional measurements related to the turbine’s opera-
tion.
In Qu et al. (2011) a MB fault diagnosis technique is pro-
posed whereby stress waves measured in the MB are decom-
posed using wavelet analysis. It is suggested that faulty vs.
healthy cases can be classiﬁed according to their D3and
D4signals. This work is based on a ﬁnite-element model
of a MB under the assumption that the bearing housing is
rigid. Practicalities of how such measurements should be ob-
tained in practise are not discussed. Further work, including
real-world testing and measurement technique consideration,
would be necessary before this method became practicable.
Zimroz et al. (2012) look to diagnose a MB fault by pro-
cessing signals of peak-to-peak vibration accelerations and
turbine power. Real turbine data are used which cover oper-
ation with a faulty MB and operation after replacement with
a non-faulty MB. Data from rated power operation and close
to start-up are ﬁltered out. The proposed method is then to
perform a straight line ﬁt to power vs. peak-to-peak values,
and it is shown that for the given fault example the result-
ing ﬁt to “good” data lies below that of “bad” data. While
this is indeed true for the fault example given, the fact that
it is the only example makes it difﬁcult to evaluate whether
these results hold in general. Furthermore, for such a method
to be usable it would be necessary to determine how differ-
ent two ﬁts need to be to signal that a fault is indeed present.
Overlaps in the data from both cases make this task harder
and a large number of datasets, including both healthy and
faulty MBs, would be needed to properly assess its applica-
bility and robustness. Ghane et al. (2016) propose the use
of main shaft V A measurements to detect possible defects in
the downwind MB of a DMB drivetrain. MB damage is mod-
elled as a change in stiffness of the locating bearing unit in
the axial direction. A cumulative sum method is used to pro-
cess acceleration signals and indicate when the probabilityof a change having happened is high enough to trigger a fault
warning. A threshold is set which trades off between speed
of detection and the likelihood of a false alarm. The data used
in the study are obtained via simulation of a 5 MW ﬂoating
turbine in conjunction with a multibody gearbox model. In
Hamadache and Lee (2016), a fault detection approach is
presented based on shaft-speed measurements. Vibration fre-
quencies introduced to the system (by various types of bear-
ing fault) are known to manifest themselves in the generator
stator current. This in turn impacts generator torque and ro-
tational speed. In steady-state conditions, the impact of this
can be modelled as introducing sinusoidal ﬂuctuations in ro-
tational speed, along with some noise. It is proposed that the
detection of these sinusoidal components can warn of a fault
being present, while the associated frequencies can indicate
the location of said fault. It should be noted that this approach
assumes steady-state operation and a ﬁxed torque at the gen-
erator. Absolute value principal component analysis is used
as the detection method. Test cases are presented using sim-
ulated data with bearing faults represented by the aforemen-
tioned rotational speed variations, including a realistic wind
speed input time history. The method behaves well for the ex-
ample data; however, whether or not the various faults mani-
fest themselves as assumed, while also being detectable from
real system measurements, is an open question. Finally, al-
though in test cases the method was found to work while in
non-steady operation, given that steady-state operation is as-
sumed, it is not clear whether a similar performance would
be seen across a turbine’s whole operating envelope. Sim-
ilar approaches to MB fault diagnosis have been proposed
which also look to exploit the presence of these same vibra-
tion frequencies in the case of a MB fault. For DD bearings
Teng et al. (2016) and Wang et al. (2017) do this by way of
decomposing vibration signals using a multiscale envelop-
ing spectrogram and multiscale ﬁltering spectrum respec-
tively; Gong and Qiao (2013) develop an approach which
looks for relevant frequencies appearing in stator current sig-
nals using a rotational-speed-invariant power spectral density
(PSD) algorithm. These latter three techniques explicitly ac-
count for varying rotational speeds during operation. Zhang
(2018) documents an approach to MB fault prediction based
on turbine SCADA measurements. An artiﬁcial neural net-
work (ANN) is used to determine a normal behaviour model
of MB temperature at time step tas related to MB tempera-
ture at timet 1 and rotational speed, active power and am-
bient temperature at time steps tandt 1. Having trained the
ANN on 6 months of normal operational data, deviations be-
tween predicted and measured outputs of MB temperature
are used to warn of faults. False positives are avoided by
considering the percentage of time for which warnings are
present over a week of operation, with an alarm threshold
of 25 %. Successful fault prediction on real turbine data is
shown for four available fault cases from an operational wind
farm. For the considered fault cases, the lead times on alarm
activation are between 2.5 months and 3 d before failure.

120 E. Hart et al.: A review of wind turbine main bearings
The wind industry itself has become adept at detect-
ing faults in WTMBs, with the most commonly used sig-
nals being V A (with a focus on ball-pass frequency) and
MB temperatures (Romax-Technology, 2019; Foundation-
AI and Ensemble-Energy, 2019). Indications of MB faults
5–6 months prior to failure are achieved fairly consistently.
9 Discussion
This paper has given a broad overview of the existing theory
and literature about, or relevant to, WTMBs. Aspects rang-
ing from wind ﬁeld structure all the way down to material
degradation and damage have been considered in order to ac-
count for the full range of interactions necessary for a com-
plete picture of MB loading and lifetime. This also allows
for cross-disciplinary understandings to be facilitated since,
as has been shown, WTMBs must be considered to be sitting
at the interfaces connecting a number of disciplines.
The main conclusion which can be drawn from this liter-
ature survey is that much future work is required in order
for WTMBs to be properly understood. It is clear that the
WTMBs have received much less attention than other driv-
etrain components in terms of both design standards and re-
search focus. This is understandable given the lack of infor-
mation properly detailing MB failures in terms of frequency
and damage modes. With respect to future efforts in this
area, failure data concerning MBs (D in Fig. 1) are there-
fore of the utmost importance. Knowledge of the types of
damage occurring in the ﬁeld are needed to drive research
directions with respect to both numerical modelling and ex-
perimental analyses. Equally crucial to this topic is the de-
velopment of a proper understanding and characterisation of
MB loads, i.e. hub and LSS loading and subsequent load dis-
tributions about bearing circumferences (A to C in Fig. 1).
This includes wind ﬁeld effects, controller interactions and
design implications for time-varying loads. Understanding
these factors will allow for a proper appraisal of current de-
sign standards (the underlying assumptions for which seem
to be dubious at best in the MB case) and recommendations
for improved design practises. A detailed understanding of
how these various factors inﬂuence MB loads and lifetimes
will also indicate potential solutions. For example, it could
be the case that detrimental and damaging MB loads can be
easily alleviated through controller design; equally, MB de-
sign considerations may in fact hold the key to lifetime ex-
tension for these components. Likely, a combination of ap-
proaches will be necessary. Finally, while a critical mass of
existing MB research has taken place in the areas of detec-
tion and prognosis for MB faults, existing methods have been
fairly generic and not speciﬁc to WTMBs. Therefore, a better
understanding of load–damage relationships and prevalent
failure modes for operating WTMBs could allow for more
tailored approaches to failure detection and prognosis. Thiscould well lead to improved results compared to the, already
promising, work which has been done in this area to date.
10 Conclusion
This paper has reviewed existing literature and theory rel-
evant to WTMBs in terms of design, operation, modelling,
damage mechanisms and fault detection. The need for more
research focusing on MBs in wind turbines was highlighted.
Work in the literature relating to wind ﬁeld structure and re-
sultant loads at the WT hub, subsequently reacted at the MB,
was presented. Common conﬁgurations and rolling elements
for WTMBs were discussed with respect to both geared and
DD turbines. The most common approaches to bearing mod-
elling and analysis, falling into dynamic and quasi-static
categories, were then outlined. After this, the tribology of
rolling bearings and an overview of relevant damage mech-
anisms were presented. Finally, existing work in the litera-
ture which considers the diagnosis and prognosis of WTMB
faults was summarised. The paper closed with a discussion
of the most important next steps for research in this area,
with key requirements being a need for detailed WTMB fail-
ure data and the development of a proper understanding of
WTMB operational loading.
