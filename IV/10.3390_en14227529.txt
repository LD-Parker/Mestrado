Abstract: Wind Turbines (WTs) are exposed to harsh conditions and can experience extreme weather,
such as blizzards and cold waves, which can directly affect temperature monitoring. This paper
analyzes the effects of ambient conditions on WT monitoring. To reduce these effects, a novel WT
monitoring method is also proposed in this paper. Compared with existing methods, the proposed
method has two advantages: (1) the changes in ambient conditions are added to the input of the WT
model; (2) an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) optimized by Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied
to construct the WT model. Using Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), compared
with the method that does not consider the changes in ambient conditions, the proposed method can
reduce the number of false alarms and provide an earlier alarm when a failure does occur.

1. Introduction
Since wind energy is renewable and pollution-free, many governments cite wind
energy as a primary future energy source [ 1]. However, the high maintenance costs of
Wind Turbines (WTs) seriously restrict the development of the wind energy industry [ 2].
The most effective way to reduce maintenance costs is to monitor the working state of WTs
to sound alarms when failures occur. Thus, model-based WT monitoring has attracted
widespread attention, and different methods have been proposed. Existing model-based
WT monitoring methods can be roughly divided into two categories [ 3]: theoretical and
data-driven. The advantage of theoretical methods is that fewer data are required. Refer-
ence [ 4] focused on the main physical mechanisms responsible for temperature changes.
Reference [5] proposed an advanced annual energy computation model.
However, WTs are complex electromechanical systems, and the relationships between
the various parameters are primarily nonlinear; thus, the construction of a theoretical
model is difÔ¨Åcult and often inaccurate [ 6]. Reference [ 7] proposed an approach that
identiÔ¨Åes turbines with weakened power generation performance through assessing the
wind power curve proÔ¨Åles. Reference [ 8] discussed the short-horizon prediction of wind
speed and power. Reference [ 9] used sophisticated models to understand the complex
WT component degradation processes and to facilitate maintenance decision-making.
Reference [ 10] proposed a robust data-driven fault detection approach. For data-driven
methods, model accuracy relies on the quality and quantity of the data. A Supervisory
Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, which can record electrical parameters
(active power, phase current, etc.), temperature parameters (main bearing temperature,
generator rotor temperature, etc.), and operating parameters (motor speed, etc.), has been
widely applied in wind farms [ 11‚Äì13].With hardware improvements, the abilities of SCADA
are increasing, making the data-driven methods more suitable for WT monitoring [14].

A typical data-driven WT monitoring method analyzes real-time data using a model
with one parameter as the output and other parameters as inputs [ 15]. When building
data-driven models, intelligent algorithms are applied. By using Nonlinear State Estimate
Technology (NSET), Reference [ 16] and Reference [ 17] built a tower vibration model and
gearbox oil temperature model, respectively. Based on logistic regression (LR), Refer-
ence [ 18] and Reference [ 19] analyzed the direct-drive wind power generation set and the
bearing performance condition, respectively. With Support Vector Machine (SVM), Refer-
ence [ 19] classiÔ¨Åed and diagnosed the possible fault of the bearing of WT. Reference [ 20]
optimized SVM for Wind Turbine fault diagnosis based on a diagonal spectrum and clus-
tering binary tree. Reference [ 21] presented a multi-sensory system for fault diagnosis
using SVM. Reference [ 22] presented a two-stage fault detection and classiÔ¨Åcation scheme
for electric motor drives in Wind Turbine pitch systems using SVM. In addition to the
above methods, Neural Network (NN) is widely applied due to its high accuracy and
short training time. Reference [ 23] achieved a robust simultaneous estimate of actuator
faults and system states using NN. Reference [ 24] applied an artiÔ¨Åcial NN approach to
the gearbox bearings. Reference [25] improved NN by mapping the original samples into
feature vectors in an embedding space. With NN, Reference [ 26] identiÔ¨Åed the wavelet-
transformed power components‚Äô open-circuit faults accurately. Reference [ 27] captured
dynamic equations modeling wind power output, vibration of the drive train, and vibra-
tion of the tower. Reference [ 28] attempted to assess the prediction intervals of time-series
predictions with NN and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM).
Since SCADA of wind farms can obtain very large datasets, NN would entail high
computational costs [ 29]. In contrast to NN, the input weights and hidden layer biases
in ELM are assigned randomly, and the output weights of the hidden layer are directly
calculated by a Moore‚ÄìPenrose (MP) generalized inverse operation [ 30‚Äì32]. Consequently,
ELM is more computationally efÔ¨Åcient than NN [ 33]. However, the ELM model is based
on one set of initial weights and biases, which are mostly random. With the randomness
of the initial coefÔ¨Åcients and large quantity of datasets, the model may easily fall into
local minima.GA is a global random search optimization algorithm based on the genetic
mechanism and evolution. Through genetic operations, the individuals with good Ô¨Åtness
are selected. With the strong global search capability, the initial coefÔ¨Åcients can be optimized
by GA and the solution can avoid local minima [ 34]. Reference [ 35] improved the accuracy
and efÔ¨Åciency of a prediction algorithm by adopting the Genetic Algorithm.
Another issue is that a WT is typically exposed to harsh Ô¨Åeld conditions year-round,
including extreme weather (blizzards, cold waves, etc.). Different ambient conditions
have different inÔ¨Çuences on the WT‚Äôs temperature parameters. On one hand, the extreme
weather causes the internal temperature to Ô¨Çuctuate, which can easily trigger a false alarm.
On the other hand, the internal temperature shows a difference in the same normal working
state due to the change in ambient temperature. For example, the ambient temperature
difference can reach 50C between summer noon and winter midnight in the wind farm
studied in this paper. Due to this huge ambient temperature difference, the main bearing
temperature of a WT can differ by 20C in a normal working state. If the WT temperature
model is constructed without considering the ambient temperature, the model can be
inaccurate, which would easily cause false alarms in a normal working state, or fail to
sound alarms when the internal temperature is abnormal.
Furthermore, many studies have conÔ¨Årmed that the WT performance is directly
related to wind speed conditions [ 36], and thus WTs‚Äô internal temperature parameters [ 37].
Therefore, it is necessary to consider the wind speed conditions in WT monitoring. In
existing studies, the wind speed condition division is primarily based on the absolute
value of the wind speed. This type of division is effective for WT power monitoring but
not accurate for WT temperature monitoring. Through research on real data, the internal
temperature is found to exhibit certain differences when wind speeds increase and decrease.
For example, the temperature difference in the same main bearing between a wind speed
increase and decrease may be more than 5C under the same wind speed of 10m/s and
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2021 ,14, 7529 3 of 15
the same ambient temperature of 15C. If the wind speed condition only depends on the
absolute value, the temperature monitoring result may be inaccurate.
To address these issues, a novel WT monitoring method is proposed in this paper.
Considering the effects of ambient conditions on the WT‚Äôs internal temperature, the ambient
temperature and wind speed change are used as inputs in the optimized ELM model, along
with other related parameters. The model is developed by training with real SCADA data.
The WT monitoring is achieved by analyzing the real-time data with the model.
In general, the primary innovations of this paper are as follows:
1. The effects of ambient conditions (ambient temperature and wind speed change) on a
WT‚Äôs internal temperature are investigated.
2. Changes in the ambient conditions are used as the input of the WT temperature model.
To our knowledge, this study is the Ô¨Årst to use wind speed change as the input of a
WT model.
3. GA is used to optimize ELM to avoid local minima due to the irregularity of initial
input weights and hidden layer bias.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 investigates the inÔ¨Çuence of
ambient conditions on WT monitoring. In Section 3, the framework of the proposed method
is presented in detail. In Section 4, the WT model is developed and veriÔ¨Åed. Section 5
presents the case study and the monitoring results of various analyses. Conclusions are
summarized in Section 6.
2. Effects of Ambient Conditions
A WT is a complex electromechanical system with many subsystems and components
(gearbox, generator and converter, etc. [ 27]), and every key component has a temperature
sensor. However, a WT is exposed to harsh weather conditions year-round and the ambient
conditions of a WT can be very different. This huge difference in the ambient conditions can
cause the internal temperatures to perform quite differently, even under the same working
state. Therefore, the effects of the ambient conditions on the internal temperatures must
be investigated. This paper investigates wind speed changes and ambient temperature.
The data in this paper come from the Damianshan Wind Farm in Wanyuan City, Sichuan
Province, China. The wind farm has a total of 33 1.5MW-WTs, with an annual power of
90.489 million kWh. The SCADA in this wind farm records data every 1 min.
2.1. Wind Speed Change
Figure 1a shows the active power‚Äìwind speed curve under a normal working state,
and Figure 1b shows the main bearing temperature‚Äìwind speed curve. To reduce the
impact of the ambient temperature, the ambient temperature of the two datasets shown in
the two curves is between 14.5C and 15.5C.

Figure 1.  WT in normal state: ( a) active power ‚Äìwind speed; ( b) main bearing temperature ‚Äìwind 
speed.  
Figure 1 a show s that the active power  is directly related to the wind speed . There-
fore, WT temperature monitoring should consider wind speed. Most existing methods 
only divide the absolute value of wind speed into three regions, (0 ‚Äì3, 3‚Äì12, and ‚â•12) m/s , 
without considering wind speed change. However, the fact is that wind speed change 
also affects  the internal temperature s. 
Figure 1b shows that the main bearing temperature increases as the wind speed in-
creases ; this result occurs  because wind speed has a direct positive correlation with rotor 
speed, which is directly related to the heat generated inside. Considering the progress of 
the heat conduction, there  may be some delay between the wind speed change and in-
ternal  temperature change. Due to  this delay, at the same wind speed, the main bearing 
temperature during a wind speed increase is smaller than during a wind speed decrease. 
Figure 2 shows the main bearing temperature ‚Äìwind speed curve of a WT during  a wind 
speed  increase and decrease. To accurately describe this phenomenon, despite the wind 
speed change, the working state and conditions are similar , which are an active power of 
900‚Äì1000  kW, an ambient  temperature of 14 ‚Äì16 ¬∞C, and a wind speed of 9 ‚Äì11 m/s. 
 
Figure 2. Main bearing temperature during wind speed increase and decrease . 
Figure 2  shows  that, under the same wind speed, the main bearing temperature 
experiences a significant difference during a wind speed increase and decrease. The av-
erage difference is 4.6  ¬∞ C, and the maximum difference can reach 5.4  ¬∞ C. These results 
indicate that wind speed change affects  the internal temperature s. Therefore, in order to 
improve the accuracy of WT monitoring, it is necessary to consider not only the absolute 
value o f the wind speed but also the wind speed change as one of  the ambient  conditions.

affects the internal temperatures.
Figure 1b shows that the main bearing temperature increases as the wind speed
increases; this result occurs because wind speed has a direct positive correlation with rotor
speed, which is directly related to the heat generated inside. Considering the progress
of the heat conduction, there may be some delay between the wind speed change and
internal temperature change. Due to this delay, at the same wind speed, the main bearing
temperature during a wind speed increase is smaller than during a wind speed decrease.
Figure 2 shows the main bearing temperature‚Äìwind speed curve of a WT during a wind

speed change, the working state and conditions are similar, which are an active power of
900‚Äì1000 kW, an ambient temperature of 14‚Äì16C, and a wind speed of 9‚Äì11 m/s.

Figure 2 shows that, under the same wind speed, the main bearing temperature
experiences a signiÔ¨Åcant difference during a wind speed increase and decrease. The
average difference is 4.6C, and the maximum difference can reach 5.4C. These results
indicate that wind speed change affects the internal temperatures. Therefore, in order to
improve the accuracy of WT monitoring, it is necessary to consider not only the absolute
value of the wind speed but also the wind speed change as one of the ambient conditions.
2.2. Ambient Temperature Change
Besides wind speed change, ambient temperature may also directly affect the in-
ternal temperature. Figure 3 shows the main bearing temperature of a WT at midnight
(2:00‚Äì3:00 a.m. ) in January (winter) and during the afternoon (14:00‚Äì15:00 p.m.) in August
(summer). It is worth mentioning that, to enable effective comparison, the wind speed
during the two periods was maintained at around 15m/s.
As shown in Figure 3, the difference in ambient temperature between winter and sum-
mer can reach 50.6C. Due to this ambient temperature difference, the average difference
in the main bearing temperature is 19.2C. The internal temperature of the WT may change
with the ambient temperature.
Additionally, extreme weather may cause large Ô¨Çuctuations in internal temperature in
a short time. Figure 4 shows the main bearing temperature changes in one hour during
a cold wave in November. During this cold wave, the WT maintains normal full-load
power generation.

 2.2. Ambient  Temperature Change  
Besides wind speed change, ambient  temperature may also directly affect the in-
ternal temperature. Figure 3 shows the main bearing temperature of a WT at midnight 
(2:00‚Äì3:00am) in January (winter) and  during the  afternoon (14:00 ‚Äì15:00pm) in August

Figure 3. Main bearing temperature within different ambient  temperature s. 
As shown i n Figure 3, the difference in ambient  temperature between winter and 
summer can reach 50.6  ¬∞ C. Due to this ambient  temperature difference, the average dif-
ference in the main bearing temperature is 19.2  ¬∞C. The internal temperature of  the WT 
may  change with the ambient  temperature.  
Additionally, extreme weather may cause large fluctuations in internal temperature 
in a short time. Figure 4 shows the main bearing temperature changes in o ne hour during 
a cold wave in November. During this cold wave, the WT maintains normal  full-load 
power generation.

Figure 4 shows that the ambient temperature undergoes a signiÔ¨Åcant drop of 10.2C
due to the cold wave and the main bearing temperature undergoes a drop of 4.4C.
The internal temperature may Ô¨Çuctuate due to extreme weather. Therefore, temperature
monitoring must consider the ambient temperature change.
3. WT Monitoring Framework
3.1. Overview of the Proposed Framework
To address the issues noted above, a novel WT monitoring method is proposed in
this paper. The framework of the proposed method is shown in Figure 5. The monitoring
process is composed of two parts: ofÔ¨Çine model construction and online data analysis.
OfÔ¨Çine model construction is to build a model that simulates normal WT behaviors, and
online data analysis determines whether the WT is in a normal working state.
Compared with existing methods, the proposed method has two key advantages.
Ambient conditions are used as the input of the WT model. As mentioned earlier, both
wind speed change and ambient temperature affect internal temperatures. Therefore, the
proposed method uses wind speed change and ambient temperature as ambient conditions
in the model input.

ELM is optimized for the randomness of initial weights and bias. Due to the ran-
domness of initial coefÔ¨Åcients, ELM may fall into local minima when constructing the
WT model. To solve this problem, GA is applied to optimize the ELM to improve the
model‚Äôs accuracy.

 Figure 4  shows  that the ambient  temperature undergoes  a significant drop of 10.2  ¬∞C 
due to the cold wave  and the main bearing temperature undergoes  a drop of 4.4  ¬∞ C. The 
internal temperature may fluctuate due to extreme weather. Therefore, temperature 
monitoring must consider the ambient  temperature change.  
3. WT Monitoring Framework  
3.1. Overview of the Proposed Framework  
To address the issues  noted above , a novel WT monitoring method is proposed in 
this paper. The framework of the proposed method is shown in Figure 5. The monitoring 
process is composed of two parts : offline model constr uction and online data analysis. 
Offline model construction is to build a model that simulates normal  WT behaviors , and

Figure 5. Framework of the pro posed method.  
Compared with existing methods, the proposed method has two key advantages . 
Ambient  conditions are used as the input of the WT model. As mentioned earlier, 
both wind speed change and ambient  temperature affect  internal temperature s. There-
fore, the proposed method uses wind speed change and ambient  temperature as ambient  
conditions in the model input.  
ELM is optimized for the randomness of initial weights and bias. Due to the ran-
domness of initial coefficients, ELM may fall into local minima when constructing  the WT 
model. To solve this problem, GA is applied to optimize the ELM to improve the  model‚Äôs 
accuracy.  
3.2. Input Parameter Selection  
The output of the model should directly describe  the WT‚Äôs working state  and have a 
strong impa ct on maintenance. Among the various  WT failures, the main bearing failure 
costs the most [ 18]. Because the main bearing temperature is closely related to the health 
of the main bearing, the main bearing temperature is chosen as the output of the model in 
this paper.  
The input should be directly related to the main bearing and WT, which are: a) the 
production parameters, such as active/reactive po wer; b) the parameters that are near the 
main bearing temperature, such as gearbox front/rear bearing temperature;  and c) am-
bient  condition s. In this study, the input of the model contains 10 parameters : active 
power, rotor speed, gearbox front bearing tem perature, gearbox rear bearing tempera-
ture, nacelle ambient temperature, tower vibration, ambient  temperature, ambient  tem-
perature change, wind speed , and wind speed change.

3.2. Input Parameter Selection
The output of the model should directly describe the WT‚Äôs working state and have a
strong impact on maintenance. Among the various WT failures, the main bearing failure
costs the most [ 18]. Because the main bearing temperature is closely related to the health of
the main bearing, the main bearing temperature is chosen as the output of the model in
this paper.
The input should be directly related to the main bearing and WT, which are: (a) the
production parameters, such as active/reactive power; (b) the parameters that are near
the main bearing temperature, such as gearbox front/rear bearing temperature; and (c)
ambient conditions. In this study, the input of the model contains 10 parameters: active
power, rotor speed, gearbox front bearing temperature, gearbox rear bearing temperature,
nacelle ambient temperature, tower vibration, ambient temperature, ambient temperature
change, wind speed, and wind speed change.
3.3. GA-ELM Modeling
The intelligent algorithm in model construction is the key to WT temperature moni-
toring. Compared with NN, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has the advantages of fast
training speed and high accuracy. ELM is composed of a single hidden layer feed-forward
Neural Network.
In ELM, X=[X1,X2, . . . , Xn]T2RnandY=[Y1,Y2, . . . , Ym]T2Rmare the input
and output of the model, respectively; wijand wijare the input and output weights,
respectively. For ndistinct samples X, the ELM can approximate the target as

where g()represents the activation function, enis the number of hidden nodes, and biis

If ELM can Ô¨Åt ndistinct samples with zero error, the matrix form of approximation
can be expressed as

With given input weights wijand hidden layer bias bj, the output weight can be
analytically calculated by a least squares method as
kHÀÜwenm Yk=kHH+Y Yk=min!enmkH!enm Yk (4)
where H+is the generalized Moore‚ÄìPenrose inverse of H.
Then, the solution can be expressed as
ÀÜwenn=H+Y (5)
However, the model is based on one set of initial input weights wijand hidden layer
bias bj, which are mostly random. With the randomness of the initial coefÔ¨Åcients, the ELM
model could easily fall into local minima. To solve this problem, GA is applied in this
paper to optimize ELM.
In GA, the coefÔ¨Åcients to be optimized are coded as individual chromosomes. In this
paper, the individual chromosome code contains the input weights and hidden layer bias
of ELM. The Ô¨Åtness F, which can judge whether the code is a good solution, is calculated as
F=1/(m

where ekis the error of ELM as ek=Yk ÀÜYkandmis the number of output layer nodes.

Step 1, selection. GA selection is based on Ô¨Åtness; the probability of selection is
calculated as
pi=k/Fi

j=1k/Fi(7)
where Nis the number of individuals.
Step 2, crossover. GA crossover of two chromosomes at gene jis calculated as

(8)
where akjandaljare the gene jof chromosome kand chromosome l, respectively, and bis
the cross-coefÔ¨Åcient, which is a random number in the range (0‚Äì1).
Step 3, evolution. GA evolution of aijis as

the current and maximum number of GA evolutions, respectively, and gis the evolution
coefÔ¨Åcient, which is in the range (0‚Äì1).
It is necessary to repeat the GA optimization until the maximum Ô¨Åtness is obtained.
The individual chromosome code with the maximum Ô¨Åtness is the optimal solution. By
decoding the optimal solution, optimal initial input weights and hidden layer bias can

regularity may not fit the ELM and BPNN model at local minima. Thus, as shown in

5. Case Study
To verify the proposed method, this paper sets up experiments for different ambient
conditions and real failure. For an extreme ambient temperature, cases of winter midnight,
summer noon, and a cold wave in normal state are presented. For wind speed change,
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2021 ,14, 7529 10 of 15
cases of wind speed increase and decrease in normal state are presented. Meanwhile, for
failure detection, a main bearing offset case is presented as well.
In these experiments, a comparison method is also applied to analyze the effects of the
ambient conditions. The framework of the comparison method is the same as that of the
proposed method, as shown in Figure 5. The comparison method uses the same GA-ELM
model as the proposed method. The only difference between the proposed method and the
comparison method is that the inputs of the comparison method, as with existing methods,
do not contain the ambient conditions. To compensate for this, four other parameters (pitch
motor 1, 2 and 3 temperature and hub ambient temperature) are added to the inputs of the
comparison method. It should be noted that the residual in this paper is the difference in
the actual value minus the predicted value. Moreover, for concise description, the proposed
method in this paper is referred to as Method I, and the comparison method is referred to
as Method II.
5.1. Ambient Temperature Change in Normal State
For ambient temperature, the data in winter, summer, and the cold wave are shown
in Table 3. It should be noted that, during these three periods, the WT is in a normal
working state.

It can be seen from Figure 8a that the Method I residual results are between  0.45C
and 0.23C, but the Method II residual results are between  2.52C and 1.86C. Similarly,
in Figure 8b, the Method II residual results (between  2.12C and 1.67C) are much
greater than the Method I residual results (between  0.19C and 0.28C) in summer.
Table 4 also shows that Method I achieves smaller statistical indicators than Method II. This
proves that, with ambient temperature and ambient temperature change, Method I achieves
better performance when facing cyclical and seasonal ambient temperature changes.
Furthermore, comparing Figure 8a,b the effect of ambient temperature in summer is
smaller than in winter. A reasonable explanation is that the difference between the main
bearing temperature and the ambient temperature is smaller in summer than in winter,
since the range of the main bearing temperature in a normal working state is approximately
55‚Äì70C.
During the cold wave shown in Figure 8c, Method I has some reasonable Ô¨Çuctuations,
but Method II shows a downward trend. If the monitoring is based on Method II, the

main bearing temperature continues to decline for 2 h, which may lead to false alarms.
However, the actual situation is that the WT is under a normal working state. This proves
that, although Method II has more temperature parameters as compensation, Method I is
more sensitive to the rapid ambient temperature change than Method II.

As shown in Figure 9a, during the wind speed increase, the residual results of 
Method I and Method II are negative. As mentio ned in Section 2, these results are due to 
the delay between the wind speed change and internal temperature change. Since the 
wind speed change is used as a model input of Method I, the delay is reduced effectively, 
and the residuals‚Äô absolute value of Method I is much smaller than that of Method II. The amplitude of Method I is 0.48 ¬∞C, and that of Method II is 4.48 ¬∞C. The same reasoning can

As shown in Figure 9a, during the wind speed increase, the residual results of Method
I and Method II are negative. As mentioned in Section 2, these results are due to the
delay between the wind speed change and internal temperature change. Since the wind
speed change is used as a model input of Method I, the delay is reduced effectively, and
the residuals‚Äô absolute value of Method I is much smaller than that of Method II. The
amplitude of Method I is 0.48C, and that of Method II is 4.48C. The same reasoning
can explain Figure 9b: during the wind speed decrease, the residuals‚Äô absolute value of
Method I is much smaller than that of Method II (0.39C vs. 1.48C, respectively). The
statistical indicators in Table 6 also prove that Method I achieves better performance than
Method II during the wind speed change.
Additionally, both Method I and II achieve better performance during a wind speed
decrease than during an increase. These results occur because the speed of wind speed
change can directly determine the delay between the wind speed change and internal
temperature change. In these two periods, the wind speed increase is faster than the
decrease, which means that the delay during the increase is larger than during the decrease.
Thus, the absolute values of the residual results during the wind speed increase are
generally larger than those during the decrease.
5.3. Main Bearing Failure Detection
To verify the failure detection ability of the proposed method, a serious main bearing
offset that occurred in the wind farm, which is shown in Figure 10, is used as a failure case.
The dataset of 5 h before the failure happened is shown in Table 7, and the residual results
are shown in Figure 11.

 Method I is much smaller than that of Method II (0.39 ¬∞ C vs. 1.48 ¬∞C, respectively ). The 
statistical indicators in Table 6 also prove that Method I achieves  better performance than 
Method II during the wind speed change.  
Additionally, both Method I and II achieve better performance during  a wind speed 
decrease than during  an increase. These results occur because  the speed of wind speed 
change  can directly det ermine the delay between the wind speed change and internal 
temperature change. In these two periods, the wind speed increase is faster than the de-
crease, which means that  the delay during  the increase is larger than during the decrease. 
Thus , the absolute  values of the residual results during  the wind speed increase are 
generally larger than  those  during  the decrease.  
5.3. Main Bearing Failure Detection  
To verify the failure detection ability  of the proposed method , a serious main bear-

Figure 11. Residual results of Method I and II in main bearing offset failure.  
The residual results of Method I and Method II both show upward trend s, which 
means that both methods could predict the failure. However, during the 5h  period , the 
ambient  temperature continued to drop  and the wind speed continued t o increase , which 
cause d the residual results of Method II at first to be  negative , falling  behind Method I. In 
particular,  at 10:16 (time point 276), the wind speed increased rapidly, which cause d the 
residual results of Method II to decrease over a short  time. Comparing the two curves, it 
can be seen that Method II generally falls behind Method I by more than 50 min, reaching 
approximately 90 min at a residual result of 2  ¬∞C. 
Considering the conclusions of the previous experiments, Method I exhibits  stable 
performance during extreme ambient  temperature s and wind speed change, and  the re-
sidual results of Method I are generally less than 0.5  ¬∞C. However, for Method II, d ue to 
the change in the ambient  conditions, residual results could be more than 1  ¬∞C, some-
times reaching 4 ¬∞C, under a normal working state. Thus , the safe range of Method I is 
narrower than  that of  Method II. If the safe range of Method I is set to ¬±1  ¬∞C and that of  
Method II is set  to ¬±2  ¬∞C, the alarm from Method I would be approximately 120 min ear-
lier than in Method II. If the safe range of Method I is set to ¬±0.5  ¬∞C and that of Method II  
is set  to ¬±4  ¬∞C, the alarm of Method I would be more than 180 min earlier than  that of  
Method II. These results demonstrate  that Meth od I,  with ambient  conditions, can 
achieve  higher  monitoring  accuracies and  earlier failure alarm s.

WTs are exposed to harsh conditions  year -round, and the variability of ambient  
conditions can affect WT monitoring directly. The main bearing temperature can be dif-
ferent in the same working state but different  under  ambient  temperature and wind 
speed change s. Conversely , a data -driven model may fall into  local minima due to the 
randomness of the initial coefficients, which can also affect  the monitoring accuracy.  
To solve  these problems , a novel WT monitoring method is proposed. The changes 
in ambient  conditions are used as input s of the WT model, and the GA -ELM is applied to 
construct the WT model. Model test ing shows that, com pared to ELM and BPNN, 
GA-ELM can avoid local minima and achieve smaller MSE, MAE , and MAPE. With cases 
in different ambient  conditions and real failure, it proves that, compared to the method 
without considering the change in ambient  conditions, the propo sed method could re-
duce false alarms when WT is in  a normal working state under extreme ambient  condi-
tions, and generate  an earlier alarm when a failure is about to occur . This means that the

Figure 11. Residual results of Method I and II in main bearing offset failure.
The residual results of Method I and Method II both show upward trends, which
means that both methods could predict the failure. However, during the 5h period, the
ambient temperature continued to drop and the wind speed continued to increase, which
caused the residual results of Method II at Ô¨Årst to be negative, falling behind Method I. In
particular, at 10:16 (time point 276), the wind speed increased rapidly, which caused the
residual results of Method II to decrease over a short time. Comparing the two curves, it
can be seen that Method II generally falls behind Method I by more than 50 min, reaching
approximately90 min at a residual result of 2C.
Considering the conclusions of the previous experiments, Method I exhibits stable
performance during extreme ambient temperatures and wind speed change, and the
residual results of Method I are generally less than 0.5C. However, for Method II, due to
the change in the ambient conditions, residual results could be more than 1C, sometimes
reaching 4C, under a normal working state. Thus, the safe range of Method I is narrower
than that of Method II. If the safe range of Method I is set to 1C and that of Method
II is set to2C, the alarm from Method I would be approximately120 min earlier than

in Method II. If the safe range of Method I is set to 0.5C and that of Method II is set
to4C, the alarm of Method I would be more than 180 min earlier than that of Method
II. These results demonstrate that Method I, with ambient conditions, can achieve higher
monitoring accuracies and earlier failure alarms.
6. Conclusions
WTs are exposed to harsh conditions year-round, and the variability of ambient
conditions can affect WT monitoring directly. The main bearing temperature can be
different in the same working state but different under ambient temperature and wind
speed changes. Conversely, a data-driven model may fall into local minima due to the
randomness of the initial coefÔ¨Åcients, which can also affect the monitoring accuracy.
To solve these problems, a novel WT monitoring method is proposed. The changes
in ambient conditions are used as inputs of the WT model, and the GA-ELM is applied
to construct the WT model. Model testing shows that, compared to ELM and BPNN,
GA-ELM can avoid local minima and achieve smaller MSE, MAE, and MAPE. With cases
in different ambient conditions and real failure, it proves that, compared to the method
without considering the change in ambient conditions, the proposed method could reduce
false alarms when WT is in a normal working state under extreme ambient conditions, and
generate an earlier alarm when a failure is about to occur. This means that the proposed
method can reduce operation and maintenance costs, thereby improving the economic
efÔ¨Åciency of wind power generation.
It should be noted that this study focuses on ambient temperature and wind speed to
describe ambient conditions. However, ambient conditions also include other factors, such
as air humidity and air pressure. In future research, these factors should also be considered
in order to improve the accuracy of WT monitoring.
