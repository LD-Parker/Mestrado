Abstract: As clean and low-carbon energy, wind energy has attracted the attention of many countries.
The main bearing in the transmission system of large-scale wind turbines (WTs) is the most important
part. The research on the condition monitoring of the main bearing has received more attention
from many scholars and the wind industry, and it has become a hot research topic. The existing
research on the condition monitoring of the main bearing has the following drawbacks: (1) the
existing research assigns the same weight to each condition parameter variable, and the model
extracts features indiscriminately; (2) different historical time points of the condition parameter
variable are given the same weight, and the inﬂuence degree of different historical time points on
the current value is not considered; and (3) the existing literature does not consider the operating
characteristics of WTs. Different operating conditions have different control strategies, which also
determine which condition parameters are artiﬁcially controlled. Therefore, to solve the problems
above, this paper proposes a novel method for condition monitoring of WT main bearings by
applying the dual attention mechanism and Bi-LSTM, named Dual Attention-Based Bi-LSTM (DA-
Bi-LSTM). Speciﬁcally, two attention calculation modules are designed to extract the important
features of different input parameters and the important features of input parameter time series,
respectively. Then, the two extracted features are fused, and the Bi-LSTM building block is utilized to
perform pre-and post-feature extraction of the fused information. Finally, the extracted features are
applied to reconstruct the input data. Extensive experiments verify the performance of the proposed
method. Compared with the Bi-LSMT model without adding an attention module, the proposed
model achieves 19.78%, 2.17%, and 18.92% improvement in MAE, MAPE, and RMSE, respectively.
Compared with the Bi-LSTM model which only considers a single attention mechanism, the proposed
model achieves the largest improvement in MAE and RMSE by 28.84% and 30.37%. Furthermore, the
proposed model has better stability and better interpretability of the monitoring process.

1. Introduction
At present, the new round of the world’s energy pattern is undergoing in-depth adjust-
ment and fundamental transformation, dominated by clean, low-carbon, smart, and efficient
energy sources and supplemented by fossil energy. Gradually reducing the consumption
of fossil energy and gradually increasing the proportion of renewable energy is becoming
a new state [ 1,2]. Wind energy is one of the clean and low-carbon green renewable energy
sources, which has naturally attracted the attention of many countries. Since the end of the
20th century, especially in the past ten years, many large-scale wind farms and WTs have
been put into use. Owing to the severe operating environment and complicated working

conditions, WTs are prone to failure, and the reasons for some failures are still unclear [ 3]. To
assure the stable and dependable operation of WTs and reduce operational and maintenance
costs, it is crucial to carry out condition monitoring and fault diagnosis [4,5].
The main bearing is a core component of the transmission system in the wind turbine [6,7] .
However, the WT main bearing is a low-speed and low-frequency large component, its
operating condition is very complex, and the dynamic load and dynamic behavior during
operation are, so far, not clear [ 8,9]. According to literature reports, alternating load and strong
impact are some of the main reasons for the failure of WT main bearing, and its fault rate has
reached 15% to 30% [ 10]. The condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of the main bearing of
WTs is worth studying. For WTs with a 20-year service life, which are equipped with SCADA
systems as standard, wind farms have generated enormous SCADA data. Many scholars have
carried out some research work on the main bearing of wind turbines due to the availability
of abundant data collected by the SCADA system and the necessity of not installing other
hardware devices [ 11,12]. Natili et al. [ 13] studied the main bearing temperature trends of
SCADA systems and built a support vector model of normal behavior to monitor the difference
between measured and estimated values to identify impending failures. Beretta et al. [ 14]
constructed a main bearing condition identification model by using some SCADA parameters,
such as main bearing temperature, wind speed, rotor speed, and power. Guo et al. [ 15] propose
a condition monitoring method for the main bearing of WTs using Gaussian process regression
and double sliding window residual processing based on some condition parameters such
as temperature, wind speed, power, and torque. Also based on some SCADA condition
parameters, the authors [ 16–18] take the previous values of these parameters to build machine-
learning models to identify main bearing failures. The above research work mainly focuses on
the main bearing temperature parameters and their related parameters. Historical information
about main bearing condition parameters is rarely considered. Some studies use weekly
statistical indicators for research and analysis; however, the research results are rough, and
the modeling accuracy is not enough. Therefore, some modeling methods that consider more
historical information of main bearing condition parameters and new deep learning models
have been proposed [ 19–21]. Some researchers have also begun to pay attention to the study
on shaft misalignment [22], main bearing degradation [23], and remaining service life [24].
The above studies mainly focus on the related parameters of the WT drive chain in
the SCADA system, such as temperature, vibration, voltage, current, and some external
environmental parameters. The research results deepen the understanding of the operation
monitoring of the main bearing. These proposed data-driven models also improve the
condition monitoring level and the ability of condition abnormal identiﬁcation, especially
in some deep learning model building, such as autoencoder, and LSTM. However, there are
still three shortcomings in the above research: (1) The existing literature assigns the same
weight to each parameter variable so that the model can extract features indiscriminately
during the model learning, but in the actual process, some parameters change slowly,
some parameters change rapidly, and the inﬂuence degree of each parameter varies, so it
is necessary to assign different weights to these parameters, and select some parameter
variables in a targeted and differentiated manner. (2) The current value of the parameter
variable is inﬂuenced by its historical value, that is, the degree of inﬂuence of different
historical time points on the current value is also different, and it is necessary to assign
different weights to different historical time points. (3) The existing literature does not
consider the operating characteristics of the WT. Different wind speed ranges have different
control strategies. For example, during the maximum wind energy tracking phase, the WT
adjusts the rotor speed according to the wind speed to keep the optimal tip speed ratio.
The speed ratio enables the WT to obtain the maximum wind energy, and in the constant
power stage, the WT maintains a constant rotational speed, so that the WT has a constant
output power by adjusting the pitch angle.
To solve the above problems, taking the large-scale direct-driven WT main bearing
of the transmission system as the research object, this paper put forward a condition
monitoring method for the WT main bearing by using the dual attention mechanism and Bi-

LSTM, named Dual Attention-Based Bi-LSTM (DA-Bi-LSTM). Recently, some deep learning
models incorporating attention mechanisms have shown good performance [ 25–27]. In
terms of feature extraction of time series data, some of them have been applied in the ﬁeld of
wind power. Su et al. [ 28] utilize a dual attention mechanism and gated recurrent unit (GRU)
to realize the condition monitoring of an offshore wind turbine gearbox based on SCADA
data. Xiang et al. [ 29] use convolutional neural network (CNN) and LSTM with attention
mechanism based on SCADA data to diagnose early failures of wind turbines. Motivated
by the above research, we introduce the attention mechanism and Bi-LSTM model to the
condition monitoring of the wind turbine main bearing. The main contributions of this
paper are summarized in the following three points:
(1) A novel operating condition monitoring method for WT main bearing by using
WT operating characteristics and SCADA dataset is proposed, named DA-Bi-LSTM, based
on the dual attention mechanism and Bi-LSTM.
(2) Utilizing the dual attention mechanism, the proposed model can further probe
the spatiotemporal relationship among the condition parameters of the main bearing itself
and its related condition parameters, strengthen the key information in the input data,
and weaken the secondary information. The parameter attention and temporal attention
mechanism can express the interpretability of the DA-Bi-LSTM model more clearly.
(3) Extensive experiments are conducted on a real-world SCADA dataset. The ex-
perimental results indicate that the proposed model outperforms Bi-LSTM and two other
Bi-LSTM models that only consider a single attention mechanism. The proposed model has
better stability and better interpretability of the monitoring process.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 depicts the working
condition analysis and condition parameters selection of large-scale direct-driven WTs. The
proposed condition monitoring model DA-Bi-LSTM is presented in Section 3, including
the problem deﬁnition, the framework for the proposed model with six submodules,
and the training algorithm. The experimental setup, results, performance analysis, and
interpretability are presented in Section 4. Conclusions are drawn in Section 5.
2. Working Condition Analysis and Parameters Selection of Large-Scale Direct-Driven WT
According to the control principle of the direct-driven WT, its working conditions can
be divided into four stages. Figure 1 gives a detailed illustration.

 speed ratio. The speed ratio enables the WT to obtain the maximum wind energy, and in 
the constant power stage, the WT maintains a constant rotational speed, so that the WT 
has a constant output power by adjusting the pitch angle. 
To solve the above problems, taking the la rge-scale direct-driven WT main bearing 
of the transmission system as the research object, this paper put forward a condition mon-
itoring method for the WT main bearing by using the dual attention mechanism and Bi-
LSTM, named Dual Attention-Based Bi-LSTM (DA-Bi-LSTM). Recently, some deep learn-

2. Working Condition Analysis and Parameters Selection of Large-Scale  
Direct-Driven WT 
According to the control principle of the direct-driven WT, its working conditions 
can be divided into four stages. Fi gure 1 gives a detailed illustration.

Figure 1. The curve of wind speed and power output of direct-driven wind turbine.
(1) Shutdown stage (seen in OA and D+): This stage includes two working conditions.
Working condition 1 (OA stage) means that the wind speed is below the cut-in wind speed
set on the nameplate, and the wind speed at this time is not enough to start the WT. Working
condition 2 (D+ stage) means the wind speed exceeds the cut-out wind speed set on the
nameplate. At this moment, the wind speed is very large. From the perspective of safety
and protection of the WT, the WT is forced to stop.
(2) Startup stage (seen in AB): The characteristics of the working condition in this
stage is that the wind speed exceeds the cut-in wind speed. After the startup condition is
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2022 ,15, 8462 4 of 17
satisﬁed, the blades are turned from the stop position to the starting position (set to 30in
our study), but the rotational speed of the hub is very low, less than the cut-in speed (set to
3.5 r/min in our study), and the WT is pre-generating.
(3) Maximum wind energy tracking stage (seen in BC): The characteristics of working
condition in this stage is that the wind speed is between the cut-in wind speed and the rated
wind speed. The hub speed is greater than the cut-in speed (3.5 r/min in our study) and less
than the rated speed. The blades turn to the working position and remain there at all times. At
this stage, the WT control system adjusts the speed of the blades according to the wind speed,
keeps the optimal tip speed ratio, and maximizes the wind power utilization coefficient.
(4) Constant power stage (seen in CD): The characteristics of the working condition
in this stage is that the wind speed is between the rated wind speed and the cut-out wind
speed. The pitch control system adjusts the pitch angle of the blade by driving the pitch
motor, variable speed gearbox, and pitch bearing, and then controls the rotational speed
of the hub. The change of the pitch angle can keep the speed of the hub around the rated
speed, and the output power is around the rated output power. At this time, the wind
energy utilization coefﬁcient is not the optimal value.
From the above analysis, it can be seen that the direct-drive WTs have different control
strategies at different stages. Based on the data we collected from our research object of
large-scale direct-drive WTs, we derived a scatter plot of wind speed and output power,
as well as a distribution map of the data in the two dimensions of wind speed and output
power, which are shown in Figure 2. In Figure 2, the BC stage and the CD stage are the main
operating stages of WT operation. These two stages mainly involve four core parameters,
namely wind speed, power, rotational speed, and pitch angle. Speciﬁcally, the main feature
of the BC stage is that the rotational speed is adjusted according to the wind speed, and
the pitch angle is always kept constant. In this way, the maximum wind energy utilization
coefﬁcient value is the largest, which also ensures that the WT can obtain more wind energy
and power. The main feature of the CD stage is to adjust the pitch angle based on the wind
speed to keep the rotation speed almost constant, the output power is always stable near
the rated power, and the WT is in a full state. Therefore, like most researchers, this paper
also selects the data sets of these two segments for modeling and analysis.

Figure 2. The scatter and distribution of wind speed and power.  
To accurately monitor and evaluate the operating condition of the main bearing, 
combined with our previous research results [3 0], there are eleven parameters that should 
be considered in the BC stage, namely, wind speed, ambient temperature, main bearing 
temperature, rotor speed, output power, generator operation frequency, generator torque, 
generator stator temperature, 5-s mean yaw to  wind, vibration in the X direction, and vi-
bration in the Y direction. In the CD stage, the pitch angle parameter should be added, so 
there are twelve parameters in this stage. 
3. Proposed Condition Monitoring Model DA-Bi-LSTM 
In this section, we first give the problem definition of condition monitoring of the WT 
main bearing. Then, we present the framework for the proposed model DA-Bi-LSTM. Fi-nally, we design the corresponding algorithm pseudocode for training the DA-Bi-LSTM 
model. 
3.1. Problem Definition 
Under normal conditions, the condition data of the WT main bearing itself and its 
associated condition data will  satisfy a dynamic and stable internal equilibrium relation-
ship, with the data fluctuating within a ce rtain range and maintaining some constraint 
characteristics between them. In the event of a failure of the main bearing, the dynamic 
equilibrium is broken. The WT main bearing condition monitoring problem can be de-
fined as a combination of a nonlinear model an d reconstruction error, which is described 
as follows: 
൜𝑍(𝑡) = 𝐹(𝑋(𝑡))
𝑅
௘=|𝑍(𝑡)−𝑋 ( 𝑡 ) | (1)
where 𝑡 denotes sampling time, 𝑋(𝑡) is the condition parameters describing the main 
bearing at the tth moment, which is the input vector of the function 𝐹(∙), especially, 
𝑋(𝑡)={ 𝑋ଵ(𝑡),𝑋ଶ(𝑡),⋯,𝑋௠(𝑡)}∈𝑅௠∗௪. 𝑍(𝑡)  is the output value of the function 𝐹(∙), 
which represents the reconstructed value of th e condition parameters of the main bearing 
at the tth moment, especially, 𝑍(𝑡)={ 𝑍ଵ(𝑡),𝑍ଶ(𝑡),⋯,𝑍௠(𝑡)}∈𝑅௠∗௪. 𝑚 is the number of 
feature parameters that characterize the operating condition of the main bearing. 𝑤 rep-
resents the length of the sliding window. 𝑋௜(𝑡) is a row vector containing the ith condi-
tion parameter with w measured values, and 𝑍௜(𝑡) is also a row vect or of the ith condi-
tion parameter with w predicted values. 𝐹(∙) represents a series of nonlinear mapping 
functions. 𝑅௘ is the reconstruction error value. Th erefore, the essence of condition moni-
toring of the main bearing is that the reconstructed vector 𝑍(𝑡) is as similar as possible to 
Figure 2. The scatter and distribution of wind speed and power.
To accurately monitor and evaluate the operating condition of the main bearing,
combined with our previous research results [ 30], there are eleven parameters that should
be considered in the BC stage, namely, wind speed, ambient temperature, main bearing
temperature, rotor speed, output power, generator operation frequency, generator torque,
generator stator temperature, 5-s mean yaw to wind, vibration in the X direction, and

vibration in the Y direction. In the CD stage, the pitch angle parameter should be added, so
there are twelve parameters in this stage.
3. Proposed Condition Monitoring Model DA-Bi-LSTM
In this section, we first give the problem definition of condition monitoring of the WT
main bearing. Then, we present the framework for the proposed model DA-Bi-LSTM. Finally ,
we design the corresponding algorithm pseudocode for training the DA-Bi-LSTM model.
3.1. Problem Deﬁnition
Under normal conditions, the condition data of the WT main bearing itself and its
associated condition data will satisfy a dynamic and stable internal equilibrium relationship,
with the data fluctuating within a certain range and maintaining some constraint characteristics
between them. In the event of a failure of the main bearing, the dynamic equilibrium is broken.
The WT main bearing condition monitoring problem can be defined as a combination of a
nonlinear model and reconstruction error, which is described as follows:
Z(t) =F(X(t))
Re=jZ(t) X(t)j(1)
where tdenotes sampling time, X(t)is the condition parameters describing the main
bearing at the tth moment, which is the input vector of the function F(), especially,
X(t) =
X1(t),X2(t),,Xm(t)	2Rmw.Z(t)is the output value of the function F(),
which represents the reconstructed value of the condition parameters of the main bearing
at the tth moment, especially, Z(t) =
Z1(t),Z2(t),,Zm(t)	2Rmw.mis the number
of feature parameters that characterize the operating condition of the main bearing. w
represents the length of the sliding window. Xi(t)is a row vector containing the ith condi-
tion parameter with w measured values, and Zi(t)is also a row vector of the ith condition
parameter with w predicted values. F()represents a series of nonlinear mapping functions.
Reis the reconstruction error value. Therefore, the essence of condition monitoring of the
main bearing is that the reconstructed vector Z(t)is as similar as possible to the input
vector X(t), with a minimum residual between the two vectors. Rerepresents the residual
value. The Revalue will exceed the threshold or alarm value if there is an abnormality or
failure in the main bearing. Under normal conditions, this residual value ﬂuctuates within
the speciﬁed normal range.
3.2. Framework for the Proposed Model
The architecture of the proposed model for condition monitoring of the WT main
bearing is shown in Figure 3. The architecture consists of six submodules, namely the input
module, the temporal attention computation module, the parametric attention computation
module, the dual attention merging module, the Bi-LSTM module, and the reconstruction
module. The following subsections describe these modules in detail.
3.2.1. Input Module
For a comprehensive description of the operating condition of the main bearing, the
condition parameters of the main bearing itself and the associated condition parameters
should be extracted. Note that the extracted parameters will be different for different
operation phases because the control strategy is different for different phases. According to
the analysis in Section 2, we obtain the input condition parameters for the maximum wind
energy tracking phase as an input matrix X, which is deﬁned in this form (m, w), where m
is the number of variables and w is the length of the window. In this study, m is set to 11,
and w is set to 5, while in the constant power phase, m is set to 12, and w is also set to 5.
For the convenience of subsequent calculations, we only discuss the BC phase here. Thus,
the input vector at the ith moment can be described as X(i) =
X1
i,X2
i,,Xm
i	
, where i
can take values in the range of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

 the input vector 𝑋(𝑡) , with a minimum residual between the two vectors. 𝑅௘ represents 
the residual value. The 𝑅௘ value will exceed the threshold or alarm value if there is an 
abnormality or failure in the main bearing. Under normal conditions, this residual value 
fluctuates within the sp ecified normal range. 
3.2. Framework for the Proposed Model 
The architecture of the proposed model for condition monitoring of the WT main 
bearing is shown in Figure 3. The architecture consists of six submodules, namely the in-
put module, the temporal attention computation module, the parametric attention com-
putation module, the dual attention merging module, the Bi-LSTM module, and the re-construction module. The following subsec tions describe these modules in detail. 
 
Figure 3. The framework of the proposed model DA-Bi-LSTM. ➀ Input module; ➁ parametric at-
tention computation module; ➂ temporal attention computation module; ➃ dual attention merg-
ing module; ➄ Bi-LSTM module; ➅ reconstruction module.  
3.2.1. Input Module 
For a comprehensive description of the oper ating condition of the main bearing, the 
condition parameters of the main bearing itself and the associated condition parameters should be extracted. Note that the extracted parameters will be diff erent for different op-
eration phases because the control strategy is different for different phases. According to 
the analysis in Section 2, we obtain the input condition parameters for the maximum wind 
energy tracking phase as an input matrix 𝑋, which is defined in this form (m, w), where 
m is the number of variables and w is the length of the window. In this study, m is set to 11, and w is set to 5, while in the constant powe r phase, m is set to 12, and w is also set to 
5. For the convenience of subsequent calcul ations, we only discuss the BC phase here. 
Thus, the input vector at the it h moment can be described as 𝑋(𝑖)={ 𝑋
௜ଵ,𝑋௜ଶ,⋯,𝑋௜௠}, 
where 𝑖 can take values in the range of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. 
3.2.2. Parametric Attention Computation Module 
In the process of parameter feature extraction, to distinguish the importance of dif-
ferent condition parameters, and assign diff erent weights to different condition parame-
ters, the parametric attention computation module can calculate the weights of the condi-tion parameters within each time step. For the given input vector 𝑋
௧={ 𝑋 ௧ଵ,𝑋௧ଶ,⋯,𝑋 ௧௠}, 
we can use Equations (2) and (3) to compute parametric attention weight distribution val-
ues.

3.2.2. Parametric Attention Computation Module
In the process of parameter feature extraction, to distinguish the importance of differ-
ent condition parameters, and assign different weights to different condition parameters,
the parametric attention computation module can calculate the weights of the condition
parameters within each time step. For the given input vector Xt=

where Wtrepresents the weight coefficient matrix, and dtrepresents the bias term, srepresents

which is a calculation method of entropy weight, and the following is the same.
3.2.3. Temporal Attention Computation Module
The values of the condition parameters of the main bearing have a clear time series
characteristic. The current value of the sequence is inﬂuenced by its historical moment
value. However, the contribution or inﬂuence of different historical moment values is
different. The temporal attention computation module can calculate the weights for each
condition parameter over multiple consecutive time steps. For the given input vector

feature value, the dual attention merging module ﬁrst calculates the temporal attention and

3.2.5. Bi-LSTM Module
The Bi-LSTM (Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory) is a bi-directional recurrent
neural network based on LSTM, which combines information from input data in both
forward and backward directions, and is a variant of LSTM. The Bi-LSTM model has
made remarkable achievements in speech processing, temporal data prediction, and text
classiﬁcation [ 25,31]. Figure 4 illustrates the architecture of a single LSTM cell/unit, where

The Bi-LSTM model is created by adding an LSTM layer in the opposite direction of 
the information flow, which has the benefit of capturing the past and future temporal de-
pendencies. Figure 5 shows the architecture  of Bi-LSTM. For the kth time point, 𝑋෨௞ is 
input to the forward and reverse LSTM, and then we get the forward and reverse hidden 
layer representations vectors 𝒉ሬሬ⃗௞ and 𝒉⃖ሬሬ௞, respectively, and we use Equation (13) to com-
bine these two hidden layer representations to get the output 𝒉௞ at kth time point. After 
the sequence 𝑋෨ is input into the Bi-LSTM, we get the final output of the module, i.e., 𝒉=

4. Experiment Setup and Result Analysis
In this section, we ﬁrst probe the distribution characteristics of the relevant condition
parameters of the WT main bearing based on the WT SCADA system. Second, we introduce
methods for data cleaning, data resampling, and dataset construction. Third, we present
the structure determination of the proposed model and the performance comparison with
other models. Finally, we present the attention and interpretability analysis of the model.
The experiment setup is as follows: Python 3.6 and the deep learning framework Keras
API are used for experimental design.
4.1. Distribution Characteristics of Partial Conditional Parameters
In this paper, the main bearing of a 2 MW direct-drive WT is investigated. The wind
turbine’s cut-in, cut-out, and rated wind speeds are 3, 25, and 11 m/s, respectively. The
wind turbine is equipped with a SCADA system that collects data at 1 Hz and stores it in a
10-min CSV ﬁle. We collected data for three months, from 5 September 2020, to 4 December
2020. According to the discussion in Section 2, we extracted the continuous data of the BC
segment and the CD segment. After removing the outage data, we found that the amount
of data in the CD segment was relatively small, which was related to the wind conditions
at that time. The wind speed is not above rated wind speed most of the time. Therefore,
the following experiments were carried out on the BC stage.
Figure 6 depicts a scatter plot of some parameters associated with the WT main bearing.
As shown in Figure 6, there is a heavy nonlinear relationship among the parameters.
Temperature, output power, and vibration are the core parameters that characterize the
operating condition of the main bearing. The temperature increases with the increase of
power, but in the same output power value range, the temperature varies widely. The
vibration values in the two directions also keep the range reduced with the increase of the
output power, but the performance is more obvious in the axial direction ( X-axis direction),
and weaker in the radial direction ( Y-axis direction). The complex nonlinear relationship
between these parameters requires powerful nonlinear ﬁtting functions to realize. We
designed such a complex function Z(t) =F(X(t))to solve this problem.

ing. As shown in Figure 6, there is a heav y nonlinear relationship among the parameters.

4.2. Data Cleansing and Resampling 
Data cleaning aims to deal with invalid data such as null values and outliers in the 
SCADA dataset due to transmission problems and WT downtime. These invalid data are 
usually empty, negative data, packet loss data, and unreasonable abnormal data. Addi-
tionally, according to existing research, data resampling techniques were used [32,33]. In this study, the resampling frequency is 1 min. The processing formula is as follows:

where, 𝑥௜ represents the data value collected by  sensors, which is second-level data. 𝑛 
represents the number of data points. 𝑥 represents the resampled data, which is an aver-
age value. 
4.3. Dataset Construction 
To continuously extract the observation data and generate the training samples and 
test samples required by the proposed model, we use the sliding window method to pro-
cess the original condition parameter data. Figure 7 shows its specific construction

the original condition parameter data. Figure 7 shows its speciﬁc construction process,
where wrepresents the width of the sliding window, srepresents the sliding step size,
irepresents a certain time point, and mrepresents the number of condition parameters
representing the main bearing. For each input vector with window length wand input
dimension m, the input vector is denoted as X.

4.4. Evaluation Metrics 
In this paper, three different evaluation metrics are chosen to evaluate the perfor-
mance of the proposed model and competitor  models. The evaluation metrics are the 
mean absolute error (MAE), the mean absolu te error percentage (MAPE), and the root 
mean square error (RMSE). Their calculat ion expressions are defined as follows:

where 𝑍𝑖 is the reconstructed value at the ith time. 𝑋𝑖 is the measured value at the ith 
time. 𝑁 is the number of sample points. 
In this study, we collect 495,900 sample data. After data cleaning and resampling, the 
total number of samples is 8265, of which 6612 samples are used for training and 1653 
samples are used for testing. Partial samples are shown in Table 1.

4.5. Determination of the DA-Bi-LSTM Model
Neural networks and deep learning models have certain randomness during training,
such as weight initialization randomness, regularization randomness, and optimization
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2022 ,15, 8462 12 of 17
randomness. Therefore, for the same data given, the output of the model has a certain
difference. A common approach is to run the network multiple times, then some statistical
methods are used to summarize the performance of the model, and ﬁnally, the best model
is selected [ 34,35]. During the training of DA-Bi-LSTM, many hyperparameters need to be
determined. Since the structure of the model designed in this paper is relatively simple, it
is an auto-encoding reconstruction model, so only the learning rate and batch size need
to be determined here. This paper uses the grid search method to run the model multiple
times. The experimental results of some evaluation indicator values, such as MAE, MAPE,
and RMSE, are shown in Table 2. It should be pointed out that the time required for the
model to run is also an important evaluation indicator, and its value is given accordingly.

From Table 2, as the batch size increases, the metrics MAE, MAPE, and RMSE values
on the test dataset tend to increase. The average proportions of batch-by-batch increase
are, in terms of MAE: 11.32%, 26.21%, 36.78%, and 42.97%. In terms of MAPE:  8.96%,
4.37%, 38.04%, and 39.89%; in terms of RMSE: 12.76%, 27.04%, 36.75%, and 43.48%. The
training time of the model shows a gradual downward trend. The proposed model is a
reconstruction model, which is relatively simple, so it does not mean that the larger the
batch size, the better, or the smaller the better. The optimal value of MAPE is reﬂected in

the batch size of 8, not 4. In addition, although the training time of the model shows a
gradual downward trend, according to the relevant selection principles, within the time
range commonly used for data collection in the industry, the smaller the three evaluation
metrics values, the better [ 8]. Therefore, our ﬁnal choice is that the batch size is set at 8, and
the learning rate is set at 0.005.
4.6. Performance Comparison
To compare the performance of the proposed model, three baseline models are used,
such as the Bi-LSTM model, the temporal attention-based Bi-LSTM (Temporal-Att-Bi-LSTM)
model, and the parameter attention-based Bi-LSTM (Parameter-Att-Bi-LSTM). All models
use the same input data format, but each input data is handled differently within each
model. Among them, the Bi-LSTM model is not added with an attention module, and it
only considers the before and after information of the time series. The Temporal-Att-Bi-
LSTM model takes into account both the temporal attention information and the before
and after information of the time series. The Parameter-Att-Bi-LSTM model considers the
parameter attention information and the before and after information of the time series.
The comparison results are listed in Table 3 and Figure 8.

Temporal-Att-Bi-LSTM, and Parameter-Att-Bi-LSTM, the MAE value of the proposed model
decreases by about 19.78%, 11.79%, and 28.84%, respectively. The standard deviation of the

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

discrimination is not obvious because MAPE is the mean of the relative percentage of the
reconstruction error to the measured value.
In Figure 8, the Parameter-Att-Bi-LSTM model that only considers parameter attention
is worse than the Bi-LSTM model because the model assigns different weights to different
parameters before extracting the information before and after the time series, ignoring
weak timing information for unimportant parameters. So, its effect is worse than the
Bi-LSTM model. The Temporal-Att-Bi-LSTM model works better than Bi-LSTM because
our data itself is time series data, and the time series attention module further highlights
the importance of the data at different times. The DA-Bi-LSTM model performs the best
because it integrates time-series attention information and parameter attention information,
the time-series information of important parameters, and the weak time-series information
of non-important parameters, which are all included. Speciﬁcally, the DA-Bi-LSTM model
emphasizes the extraction of the importance of different input parameters and the extraction
of parameter time series features. Then, the extracted information from the two aspects
is further fused, and the time series features of the composite information are ﬁnally
extracted and learned. Therefore, its information representation and extraction ability are
the strongest, and the effect is also the best.
4.7. Attention and Interpretability Analysis
The attention mechanism module in the proposed model can give the dynamic atten-
tion score of each parameter of each input sample to the operating condition of the main
bearing in real time and can reﬂect the contribution of different time points and different
parameter variables to the main bearing in real time. In a heatmap of attention scores, the
darker the color, the higher the attention value, and vice versa.
In the parametric attention score calculation module, we extract the parametric at-
tention score value of a sample, as shown in Figure 9. Where the horizontal coordinate,
X-axis, represents different time points, the vertical coordinate, Y-axis, represents 11 con-
dition parameters, and the numbers in the ﬁgure represent the contribution of parameter
attention. The attention score of each condition parameter variable is different. Vibration
in two directions and “5 s mean yaw wind” are important parameters, especially in the
Y direction. However, the degree of inﬂuence for some parameters such as temperature
is not as obvious. Speciﬁcally, the attention score of “Y vibration value” is the largest,
accounting for about 17.72% on average, and it is maintained, followed by “5 s mean yaw
wind”, “X vibration”, “average temperature of generator stator”, and “wind speed”, which
accounted for 13.09%, 12.13%, 10.52%, and 9.73%, respectively. The lowest attention scores
are “average temperature of the main bearing” and “power output”, which are 4.36% and
4.42%, respectively. The parameter attention calculation module can select some parameter
variables and can assign different attention scores to these parameters according to the
speed of parameter change and the constraint relationship between parameters in the actual
process of monitoring.
In the temporal attention score calculation module, we also extract the temporal
attention score value of a sample, as shown in Figure 10, where the horizontal coordinate
represents different time points, the vertical coordinate represents 11 condition parameters,
and the numbers in the ﬁgure represent the contribution of the temporal attention score.
Relative to time t, most of the temporal attention scores are highest at time t  1 and
time t 3, accounting for about 20.23% and 20.14%, respectively. The most obvious one
is “wind speed”, accounting for 20.6%, followed by “generator torque”, accounting for
20.47%, followed by “power output” and “5-s mean yaw to wind”, accounting for 20.35%
and 20.3%, respectively. The temperature parameter is a gradually changing quantity.
However, the time-series attention score distribution of temperature parameters still has
differences in the main bearing and related components parameters. The attention score
distribution of the temperature of the main bearing itself is relatively balanced at about
20%, at times t 2 and t 4, the proportion is larger, showing a high in the middle and
low at both ends. However, there is no obvious regularity in the changes of the generator
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

stator temperature parameters and the external environment temperature parameters, and
the standard deviation of its attention score is the lowest, 0.0011. The standard deviation of
attention scores for the vibration parameter of “vibration in X direction” was the largest,
followed by the wind speed parameter, which was 0.008 and 0.0057, respectively. This
also shows that the wind speed ﬂuctuates greatly, and the X-axis ﬂuctuates greatly. The
temporal attention calculation module can select different time points and can assign
different attention scores to different historical time points, emphasizing the expression of
key information at important time points.

Figure 9. A heatmap of parametric attention scores.  
In the temporal attention score calculation module, we also extract the temporal at-
tention score value of a sample, as shown in Figure 10, where the horizontal coordinate 
represents different time points, the vertical coordinate represents 11 condition parame-
ters, and the numbers in the figure represent the contribution of the temporal attention 
score. Relative to time t, most of the temporal attention scores are highest at time t − 1 and 
time t − 3, accounting for about 20.23% and 20.1 4%, respectively. The most obvious one is 
“wind speed”, accounting for 20.6%, followe d by “generator torque”, accounting for 
20.47%, followed by “power output” and “5-s mean yaw to wind”, accounting for 20.35% 
and 20.3%, respectively. The temperature parameter is a gradually changing quantity. 
However, the time-series attention score distribution of temperature parameters still has differences in the main bearing and related components parameters. The attention score 
distribution of the temperature of the main bearing itself is relatively balanced at about 
20%, at times t − 2 and t − 4, the proportion is larger, sh owing a high in the middle and 
low at both ends. However, there is no obvious regularity in the changes of the generator 
stator temperature parameters and the exte rnal environment temperature parameters, 
and the standard deviation of its attention sc ore is the lowest, 0.0011. The standard devi-
ation of attention scores for the vibration parameter of “vibration in X direction” was the 
largest, followed by the wind speed paramete r, which was 0.008 and 0.0057, respectively. 
This also shows that the wind speed fluctuates greatly, and the X-axis fluctuates greatly. 
The temporal attention calculation module can select different time points and can assign different attention scores to different histor ical time points, emphasizing the expression 
of key information at important time points.

5. Conclusions 
This work presents a novel method of condition monitoring for WT main bearing by 
using the dual attention mechanism and Bi-L STM. The effectiveness of the proposed 
method is verified by using the WT SCADA data. The research results show that the pro-posed model for the different working conditio ns can further exactly explore the spatio-
temporal correlation between the condition parameters of the WT main bearing itself and 
its associated condition parameters, strength en the key information in the input data, 
weaken the secondary information, and improv e the precision of the main bearing condi-
tion monitoring and the interpretability of the monitoring model. 
In the future, we will furthe r expand the verification and application of the proposed 
model in the constant power stage, and also include the modeling of the model on other 
key components or subsystems, such as gene rators, hubs, pitch systems and yaw systems, 
etc. At the same time, we will also consider  field testing and deployment of the proposed 
method for better monitoring and earlier warning of WT main bearing failures.
