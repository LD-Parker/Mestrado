ABSTRACT
Unexpected main bearing failure on a wind turbine causes
unwanted maintenance and increased operation costs (mainly
due to crane, parts, labor, and production loss). Unfortunately,
historical data indicates that failure can happen far earlier than
the component design lives. Root cause analysis investiga-
tions have pointed to problems inherent from manufacturing
as the major contributor, as well as issues related to event
loads (e.g., startups, shutdowns, and emergency stops), ex-
treme environmental conditions, and maintenance practices,
among others. Altogether, the multiple failure modes and
contributors make modeling the remaining useful life of main
bearings a very daunting task. In this paper, we present a
novel physics-informed neural network modeling approach
for main bearing fatigue. The proposed approach is fully hy-
brid and designed to merge physics-informed and data-driven
layers within deep neural networks. The result is a cumulative
damage model where the physics-informed layers are used
model the relatively well-understood physics (L10 fatigue
life) and the data-driven layers account for the hard to model
components (i.e., grease degradation).
1. INTRODUCTION
As pointed by Hornemann and Crowther (2013), main bear-
ings of onshore wind turbines are subjected to multiple failure
modes, among which we can mention wear and micro-pitting,
false brinelling due to stationary loading, electrostatic dis-
charge, cage and guide ring wear, manufacturing defects and
quality problems. Factors that trigger these failure modes in
the field include:
•Environment: extreme wind conditions, hazardous weather,
ambient temperature, humidity, dust, etc.
•Operation: machine controls (e.g. induced yaw misalign-
ment for wake management), derating levels, etc.

Literature reports a number of approaches to main bearing life
estimation. Butler et al. (2012) focused on utilizing supervi-
sory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data to forecast
the remaining useful life by constructing a residual model
for bearing temperature. Authors considered variables such
as main shaft rotational speed, hydraulic brake temperature,
hydraulic brake pressure, and blade pitch position as well as
a compensation for ambient temperature. As a result, they
managed to provide a failure indication with a 30 day lead
time. Another example is the result published by Watanabe
and Uchida (2015). Authors estimate wind turbine rear bear-
ing fatigue using standard bearing life calculations found in
ISO 28123. The model uses hub-height 10 minutes wind
data as an input. The model showed good agreement with
failures observed in Japan. While collected field data indi-
catedL10= 12:7years, the model predicted L10= 12 years.
Authors also showed how their model could be used to quan-
tify life extension through curtailment. Yucesan and Viana
(2019a) used a fatigue damage accumulation model to man-
age reliability at a wind-turbine level across different farms.
The results demonstrate that fatigue life contributes signifi-
cantly to bearing failures, especially under poor lubrication
conditions. They also showed how to use the cumulative dam-
age model to promote component life extension (assigning
turbine-specific maintenance through regreasing). Address-
ing similar concerns, Walker and Coble (2018) proposed a
combined adaptive sampling and order tracking approach to
investigate vibration sensor data for fault detection. While the
authors use the adaptive sampling non-stationary signals are
converted to stationary, they utilize order tracking to distin-
guish the bearing fault. In their case study, they were able to
detect the bearing fault of one of the machines and confirmed
the failure in postmortem examinations.
From a physics perspective, it is understood that lubricant con-
dition drastically affects bearing fatigue life. Unfortunately,
modeling the lubricant degradation is incredibly difficult. Zhu

et al. (2013) proposed a methodology for estimating the re-
maining useful life of lubricant using viscosity and a dielectric
constant sensor output and integrating these parameters as an
observation function by particle filtering technique to predict
the remaining useful life of the lubricant. Their proposed
model was validated by laboratory experiments. Results of
the conducted case study show that the single observation
on dielectric constant sensor gives the best accuracy on the
life prediction. Another research was conducted by Iyer et
al. (2007) to provide a method for the early detection of lu-
brication anomalies in oil-lubricated bearings. The authors
investigated two types of anomalies: lack of lubricant and
presence of contamination. In their study, they used acoustic
emissions and vibration signals. Through experiments, they
showed that these techniques not only detect the anomaly, but
also provide an insight on the level of the anomaly.
Detecting component condition is important; however, it is
the forecast of remaining useful life (prognosis) that defines
critical decisions in a wind farm (such as repair versus replace-
ment, bundling services in wind turbines to save on crane
costs, etc.). These decisions are based on predictive models
built using kernels that can be physics-informed, data-driven,
or a combination of both. Liu and Mahadevan (2009) pro-
posed two efficient methods for the time-dependent fatigue
reliability analysis. The authors used a modified Miner’s rule
approach for nonlinear damage accumulation and carried out
uncertainty quantification for the life curves they used in their
experimental validation. They applied two methods for fatigue
reliability calculation: moment matching approach and first-
order reliability method. Results from the validation prove the
efficiency of these methods compared to the simulation-based
approaches. Goebel et al. (2008) investigated data-driven
models for prognostics. Authors compared three distinct data-
driven techniques for prognostics: relevance vector machine,
Gaussian process regression, and neural networks. They tested
and compared these methods on a damage propagation prob-
lem with sparse and noisy data. Although they showed all
these methods can learn the dynamics of the propagation fairly
well, the authors also emphasized that the discrepancy be-
tween models and the ground true is mainly caused by inade-
quate amount of training data. Eker et al. (2019) proposed a
methodology that uses physics-informed model for short-term
prediction and then integrates it with a longer-term projection
of a similarity-based data-driven framework. They illustrate
the performance of their approach on two engineering applica-
tions and prove that a hybrid approach can improve accuracy,
robustness, and applicability; and reduce the number of data
required for modeling.
The steady growth of computational power available con-
tributed to the popularization of machine learning in engineer-
ing applications. The scientific community has studied and
proposed architectures that leverage formulations based on
physics (Yu et al., 2018; Raissi & Karniadakis, 2018; Chen etal., 2018). In essence, differential equations are used to train
multilayer perceptrons and recurrent neural networks1. One
distinct research that incorporates physics into the solution of a
machine learning problem is conducted by Matei et al. (2019).
In their contribution authors consider a classification problem
based on a data generated by a partially-known physical sys-
tem. They leverage the partially-known physics to reduce the
difficulty of the problem from a complex classifier to a simple
regression problem. The authors illustrated their proposed
approach on a rail switch system and proved the performance
of this hybrid approach is as good as purely data-driven model.
Nascimento and Viana (2019) proposed a recurrent neural
network cell inspired on cumulative damage models2. As the
authors provide an efficient way to use physics-based and
data-driven layers together within a recurrent neural network
cell, they illustrate the predictive capability of their proposed
technique on a fatigue crack damage accumulation problem.
They finally showed that this hybrid approach can successfully
model fatigue crack growth even with inadequate training data
(i.e., small number of observations or unbalanced data).
This paper proposes overcoming some of the limitations
in modeling bearing fatigue life by infusing physics into
machine learning models. Namely, we propose modeling
fatigue life through a cumulative damage model coded in the
form of a recurrent neural network (Goodfellow et al., 2016).
Bearing fatigue is implemented through a physics-informed
layer within this network while lubricant degradation is im-
plemented through a purely data-driven layer. The proposed
approach is fully hybrid as it merges physics-informed and
data-driven layers within deep neural networks. The result is a
cumulative damage model where the physics-informed layers
are used to model the relatively well understood physics ( L10
fatigue life) and the data-driven layers account for the hard to
model components (contribution due to poor greasing condi-
tions). In order to present the main features of the proposed
physics-informed neural network, we use openly available
data about main bearing failures for a 1.5 MW wind turbine
platform and weather data for a representative wind farm.
The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
gives an overview on physics-informed neural networks and
our approach to modeling main bearing fatigue and grease
degradation. Section 3 describes the case study and the design
of the neural network. Section 4 presents and discusses the
numerical results. Finally, section 5 closes the paper recapit-
ulating salient points and presenting conclusions and future
work. There is one appendix at the end of the paper, discussing
grease degradation modeling, data, bearing temperature calcu-
lation, and activation functions.

al., 2014; Raissi et al., 2018).

cumulation of damage (progressive distress) throughout the useful life of

2.1. Background: Recurrent Neural Networks and Cu-
mulative Damage Models
Recurrent neural networks have been widely used to model
time-series (Connor et al., 1994; Sak et al., 2014; Chauhan &
Vig, 2015) speech recognition (Graves et al., 2013), remaining
useful life estimation (Gugulothu et al., 2018), and many other
applications. These neural networks transform a vector of
hidden states, d, from time stamp t 1to time stamp t, in the
following fashion:
dt=f(dt 1;xt) (1)
wheret2[0;:::;T ]represent the time discretization, d2
Rndare the states representing the sequence, xt2Rnxare
input (observable) variables, and f()is the transformation to
the hidden state (as known in the literature as recurrent neural
network cell).
As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the recurrent neural network cells
repeatedly apply the transformation f(dt 1;xt)as a way to
update the states. In its simplest form, f(dt 1;xt)can be im-
plemented as a single-layer perceptron (fully-connected dense
layer), shown in Fig. 1b. Nevertheless, the cell architecture
can be implemented using much more elaborated designs. For
example, the scientific community have proposed the Long
short-term memory cell (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997),
illustrated in Fig. 1c. The cell was designed to (a) improve
the predictions of the neural network, and (b) mitigate the
vanishing gradient problem (Goodfellow et al., 2016). For
further details on recurrent neural networks (including applica-
tions), the interested reader is referred to Connor et al. (1994);
Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997); Sutskever et al. (2011);
Graves et al. (2013); Sak et al. (2014); Chung et al. (2015);
Chauhan and Vig (2015); Goodfellow et al. (2016).
Cumulative damage models (Fatemi & Yang, 1998; Frangopol
et al., 2004) represent the irreversible accumulation damage
through am initial value problem. In its discrete form, dtis
the damage at time tand it is the result of a damage increment
dton top of damage dt 1at previous time step t 1:
dt=dt 1+ dt (2)
where dtis often a function of dt 1and some other inputs
xtat timet. The characterization of the damage dt(which
is associated with a failure mechanism) and the inputs xt
depends on the problem. For example, if fatigue is the failure
mechanism, fatigue crack length is the observable quantity.
The inputs xtusually express time-dependent loading and
boundary conditions (e.g., pressures, temperatures, torques,
mechanical and thermal stresses, etc.) or even operating points
(e.g., wind speed, blade pitch angles, etc.).
We use the repeating cell proposed by Nascimento and Viana
(2019) and illustrated in Fig. 2 to model cumulative damage

through recurrent neural networks. ‘‘MODEL’’ maps the
inputs xtand previous damage dt 1into a damage increment
dt. In other words, the ‘‘MODEL’’ block implements the
damage increment in the damage accumulation model. There
is nothing preventing the implementation of ‘‘MODEL’’ to be
purely physics-informed3or purely data driven (such as using
a multilayer perceptron). Nevertheless, as we discuss in next
section, we advocate towards implementing ‘‘MODEL’’ as a
hybrid model (where some parts are physics-informed while
others are data-driven).

2.2. Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Main Bear-
ing Fatigue and Grease Degradation
Bearing fatigue life can be modeled in terms of the dynamic
loads and multiplication factors that reflect design, alloy, sur-
face treatment, lubrication, and contamination, among other
factors. As found in the SKF catalog for spherical roller bear-
ings (SKF-contributors, 2007), fatigue life can calculated as:
LBRG
nm =a1aSKFC
P10

andLBRG
nmh =106
60NLnm;(3)
whereLBRG
nm is the main bearing rated life at 100 n%re-
liability (in millions of revolutions), LBRG
nmh is the rating life
at100 n%reliability (in operating hours), Cis the basic
dynamic load rating (in kN), Pis the equivalent dynamic
bearing load (in kN), and Nis the rotational speed (in rpm).
Table 1 illustrates few values for the reliability level life ad-
justment factor, a1. Figure 3 shows few curves for the SKF
life modification factor, aSKF.

Table 1.a1life adjustment factor (SKF-contributors, 2007).
Figure 3.aSKF life adjustment factor, adapted from SKF-
contributors (2007).
The adjustment factor aSKF depends on the lubricant condi-
tion (in terms of viscosity, through the viscosity ratio, , andparticulate contamination through the contamination factor,
c), the equivalent dynamic bearing load P, and the fatigue
load limitPu. Viscosity ratio, , is expressed as:
== 1; (4)
whereactual operating viscosity of the lubricant (mm2/s),
and1rated viscosity, depending on the bearing mean diame-
ter and rotational speed, (mm2/s).
When a bearing operates at different load and rotational speed
levels, the rated lives are obtained through Palmgren-Miner’s
rule:

wheretiis number of hours the turbine ran at Nirpm. In other
words, the Palmgren-Miner’s rule characterizes the incremen-
tal damage at each cycle:
dBRG

LBRG

wherentis the number of cycles passed for each time step.
In this paper, we used data available in the literature to charac-
terize the viscosity of grease as a function of temperature as
well as contamination factor as a function of viscosity ratio (as
illustrated in Fig. 4). There are several curves that represent
grease types with different viscosity grades (VG) given in
the SKF plot for lubricant viscosity calculation. We picked
VG 320 for our case study as the virgin (undamaged) grease
behavior, following recommendations found in the Schaeffler
catalogue (Schaeffler-contributors, 2016). As for contamina-
tion factor, we considered that virgin grease would present
slight contamination, while degraded lubricant would present
very severe contamination (SKF-contributors, 2007). Figure 4
illustrates the variation of grease properties for the virgin and
degraded greases.
After determining the grease damage value, we use it as a
factor to interpolate between curves assigned to the virgin and
degraded states of the lubricant (see Fig. 4):

whereandcare viscosity and contamination factor of the
grease respectively.
It is challenging to build a purely physics-informed model
for bearing fatigue life since grease degradation is extremely
complex. In this paper, we build a recurrent neural network
that tracks bearing fatigue damage, dBRG
t, and grease dam-
age,dGRS
t, simultaneously through a hybrid model. The
bearing fatigue damage increment dBRG
t implements Eq.

increment represents the degradation of viscosity and in-
crease in contamination. There are attempts to build physics-
informed models for grease life, but it is not clear how they
relate to field conditions (see appendix for one example of
such models). Here, we implement the grease damage in-
crement dGRS
tthrough a multilayer perceptron.
With that, we propose the repeating recurrent neural network
cell illustrated in Fig. 5 to model the bearing and grease cu-
mulative damage. This recurrent neural network cell takes
wind speed ( WSt) and the bearing temperature ( Tt) as input
variables. The cell will be recurrently used, as in Fig. 1a,
updating both the grease and bearing damages from previ-
ous time step ( dGRS
t 1anddBRG
t 1, respectively). While WSt
is mapped to equivalent dynamic bearing load ( Pt) (see Fig.
7c), bearing temperature ( Tt) and cumulative grease damage
from previous time step ( dGRS
t 1) are used to calculate grease
damage parameters tandct(as in Fig. 4). Combined withPt, these parameters are incorporated to evaluate inverse life
adjustment factor 1=aSKFt(see Fig. 3), which is then mul-
tiplied with non-adjusted bearing fatigue damage increment
(nt=Nt) for bearing fatigue damage increment ( dBRG
t) cal-
culation (Eqs. (3-6)). The data-driven portion of the hybrid
model is given by prediction of grease damage increment
(dGRS
t) via multilayer perceptron using Pt,Tt, anddGRS
t 1
as inputs (further discussed in section 3.4). In this scheme,
while we maintain a physics portion with bearing fatigue ac-
cumulation, we compensate the missing physics knowledge
within the grease model with the help of neural networks. The
training of this recurrent neural network aims at calibrating
the multilayer perceptron using grease damage observations
and let it learn the damage accumulation on grease. Our im-
plementation allows for optimization of parameters within
the physics-informed layers (in case these are inaccurate or
unknown). We recognize that calibrating these physical pa-
rameters might recquire acquisition of data that supports such
task. In this study, we focus on compensating the unknown
grease degradation phenomenon through data-driven layers.

main bearing fatigue and grease degradation.
One might be tempted to ask why using the cell shown in
Fig. 2 instead of architectures such as the long-short term
memory shown in Fig. 1c? Why should one use hybrid model
mixing physics-informed and data-driven layers? The answer
has to do with the specific application of the cumulative dam-
age models. In this paper, as in many other applications in
prognosis, the input conditions (loads, temperatures, etc.) are
fully observed (throughout the entire time series). However,
damage is only partially observed. As we will discuss next,
grease damage is assessed through grease sample analysis
done in specialized laboratories in regular intervals. Bearing
fatigue is rarely quantified and, for the most part, only time of
failure is known. Figure 6a shows the typical data collected

for training the cumulative damage model. In fairness, this
represents only one specific wind turbine; and likely, there
would be load history and inspection data available for few
wind turbines. Figure 6b illustrates the typical data collected
for prediction using the trained cumulative damage model.
Again, load history is available throughout the useful life and
the initial value for the states is either known or assumed. The
cumulative damage model is then used to estimate the damage
over time. Given the extremely few observations of damage,
we argue that using purely data-driven architectures is un-
likely to lead to accurate models. Architectures such as long
short-term memory and other purely data-driven architectures
might still be useful in cases where there is full observation
of the states. This can happen when damage is continuously
monitored through dedicated health monitoring sensors (e.g.,
comparative vacuum monitoring (Roach, 2009), fiber Bragg
grating sensors (Hill & Meltz, 1997), etc.). However, this is
not the case (as techniques such as these are rarely used in
main bearing monitoring) nor the focus of this paper.

point mounting configuration. Table 2 provides some key
parameters of wind turbine and main bearing used in our
cased study.

Mapping from wind speed to dynamic bearing loads is main-
tained using a published National Renewable Energy Labora-
tory (NREL) report (Sethuraman et al., 2015), which involves
a plot that provides dynamic load value for a given wind speed
condition for the same type of main bearing we used in our
case study, mounted on a 1.5MW wind turbine. The authors
report that the mapping is a result of multi-body model simu-

3.2. Nominal Wind Speed and Bearing Temperature
Site-specific data is obtained from a database also provided by
NREL (Draxl et al., 2015), which includes environmental data
at one hour resolution between 2007 and 2013 for 126,000 dif-
ferent locations throughout the United States. For the present
case study, we arbitrarily chose Clayton, NM without any
particular reason. Although data does not come directly from
an actual wind park, we believe the NREL data provided for
Clayton, NM is representative of a region in the USA with
high penetration of wind energy.
In order to mimic SCADA systems, the original NREL envi-
ronmental data is augmented (up-sampling) to achieve the 10
minute resolution. Data is also extended up to 30 years to be

used for long term bearing fatigue life predictions. Details of
the data augmentation are given in the appendix. On top of
that, since main bearing temperature is not originally available,
we use an analytical model to estimate these values based on
ambient and produced power. The details are given in the
appendix. At the end, the time series that we consider nominal
conditions for wind speed and bearing temperature are shown
in Fig. 8.
In order to generate synthetic set of wind turbines, we divided
7 years of data into segments of 6 months which yields to 14
different data sets that we treat as 14 different turbines. We
partitioned these machines into 10 training and 4 validation
turbines.

perature. Data is represented in gray and trend is plotted in
blue (monthly moving average to highlight any seasonality).
3.3. Grease Samples
The bearing fatigue model needs information about the vis-
cosity and contamination of grease over time. One way to
obtain these grease parameters is through periodic sampling
and laboratory analysis. With the process repeated periodi-
cally, the parameters used in bearing fatigue estimation could
be updated, allowing for accurate lifing of the component.
Here, we create grease sample analysis results synthetically us-
ing the model described in the appendix. In order to make the
study more interesting, the effect of grease state on grease re-
lated parameters like viscosity and contamination is described
by a quadratic relationship (see Fig. 9):
dGRS=1
(LGRS)2; (9)
wheredGRSis the grease damage that directly relates to dam-
age in terms of viscosity (i.e. loss of viscosity) and damage in
contamination (i.e., increase in contamination), and LGRSis
the life of grease (see Eq. 12 shown the appendix).
Equations 7, 8, and 9 are rather arbitrary and they are only
used here as a way to generate grease sample data for this
study. As mentioned before, wind farm operators and service
providers could obtain data for viscosity and contamination
through grease sample analysis. We could have separated
the grease damage in terms of viscosity, d, and damage in
contamination, dc. However, in this study we simplified and
makedGRS=d=dc. In reality, the damage accumulation
rates can vary depending on the grease parameter of inter-

est. We build our grease sample data by assuming that grease
analysis is conducted at the end of every month continuously
for a period of six months. The sampling procedure essen-
tially assess the level of degradation of grease. By this logic,
we collectdGRSvalues for each turbine at the end of each
month for six months. We also assume that full regreasing of
main bearing occurs every 6 months. In terms of modeling,
regreasing basically resets the grease damage back to zero
(i.e.,dGRS= 0after regreasing).
3.4. Physics-informed Neural Network Design
We considered the following information is available:
•for every turbine in the fleet: wind speed and main bear-
ing temperature from SCADA (inputs for the model as
described in section 2.2), and
•for part of the fleet: grease damage metric, dGRS, ob-
served every month for six months straight.
With that information, we proceed to build a hybrid physics-
informed neural network model for bearing fatigue. In this
model, the grease degradation increment, dGRS, is a mul-
tilayer perceptron and the bearing damage accumulation is
physics-informed. The inputs of the multilayer perceptron
models are scaled between zero and one to avoid the disparity
in the order of magnitude of inputs interfering in the fitting of
the neural networks. Table 3 details the multilayer perceptron
architectures tested in this work. For the most part of this
paper, we decided to use MLP#1 architecture to illustrate the
ability to fit a neural network with a large number of train-
able parameters. Nevertheless, we also included the study
on the effect of different architectures on the overall model
performance in section 4.
The constructed multilayer perceptron takes three inputs (wind
speed, bearing temperature, and current predicted ^dGRS) and
provides one output ( dGRS).Interestingly, dGRSis never
observed. Instead, the cumulative damage dGRSis ob-
served through grease sample laboratory analysis. This
imposes a challenge for the fitting of the model and the
fact we use physics-informed kernels helps addressing it.Layer MLP#1 MLP#2 MLP#3

Here, we used the mean squared error as the loss function
while optimizing the trainable parameters of the recurrent neu-
ral network. Since we have the dGRSobservation only at
grease inspection, we write the loss function to only account
for the prediction error at these data points:
Loss =1

NOis the number of observations for a single turbine, dGRS
ij
is theithobservation of grease damage (from sample results)
forjthturbine, and ^dGRS
ij is the predicted grease damage for
theithgrease sample of the jthturbine.
Optimizing the 1,251 trainable parameters can be a challeng-
ing task. An initial point far away from actual relationship
might cause divergence or very long time of training process.
Therefore, initializing the weights and biases of this neural
network model can greatly improve the training process. We
propose constructing a simple linear plane representation of
the input output relationship:
dGRS=0+1T+2WS+3^dGRS(11)
where dGRSis the grease damage increment, Tis the main
bearing temperature, WS is the wind speed, and ^dGRSis
predicted cumulative grease damage.
The coefficients, i, are initialized using engineering judg-
ment. For example, we assume that dGRSincreases with
increasing bearing temperature; therefore, the 1has to be
positive. Similarly, engineering judgment can be used to limit
dGRS, which is expected to be on the order of magnitude of

represents the actual (but unknown) input output behavior and
the blue plane is the approximation to this behavior given by
the multilayer perceptron. Note that the third input variable
grease damage is fixed to 0.5 for this plot, in order to make
3D plotting possible.
Figure 10. Plane approximation to actual data. Note that in
this illustration the third variable, dGRS), is fixed to 0.5.
We first train our multilayer perceptron model with the plane
approximation. In order to achieve that, we used the RM-
Sprop4optimizer set with learning rate 0.01 and 500 epochs.
We used the mean square error as the loss function. The sec-
ond stage of the training process is fine tuning the recurrent
neural network using the masked mean square error given
in Eq. (10) as the loss function. Again, we used RMSprop,
but this time set with learning rate 0.0005 and 50 epochs.
Overall algorithm flowchart for data collection, training, and
predicting is as shown in Fig. 11.
In section 4, we show how the recurrent neural network per-
forms when initialized with 10 different randomly generated
icoefficients (all constrained by engineering judgment of
how inputs affect the output).

‘‘pinn wind bearing’’ repository found in Yucesan and Viana
(2019b). This repository includes two sets of code. The basic
set contains a script that trains the recurrent neural network
using a pretrained multilayer perceptron model with fixed
initial weights, and another script that predicts the fatigue
damage accumulation of the wind turbine main bearing for
6 months. The advanced set of codes contains scripts that
generate a random plane approximation for multilayer percep-
tron training; train the multilayer perceptron with randomly
generated initial weights; train the recurrent neural network
using trained multilayer perceptron model; and predict the fa-
tigue damage accumulation of the wind turbine main bearing
for 30 years. The data used in this work is publicly avail-
able in Yucesan (2019). Download the data and extract fold-
ers inside ‘‘wind bearing dataset’’ to the directory where the
‘‘pinn wind bearing’’ repository is cloned. All simulations
were conducted using a laptop configured with an Intel Core
i7-8650U CPU at 1.90GHz, 32GB of RAM, and NVIDIA

4. R ESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In our data set, we have a set of 10 turbines, for which we have
10-minute average operational data (wind speed and bearing
temperature) as well as monthly grease damage data. We also
have a set of 4 validation turbines, for which we only have 10-
minute average operational data. Figures 12 and 13 present the
variation ofdGRS, wind speed, and bearing temperature versus
time for two wind turbines within the set (turbines #2and
#9). In these figures, blue lines in wind speed and temperature
plots show the trend of the data, from which we can observe
the seasonality. These help visualizing the diversity in our
training set and also help understand how severity in operation
(through wind speed and bearing temperature) impact the
damage accumulation rate.

As detailed in section 3.4, we generated 10 random planes (as
exemplified in Fig. 10) to initialize the trainable parameters
of our neural network. Here, we named these initializations
as case #1to case #10. After that, we compared the perfor-
mances of these planes against the actual (but unknown) value
ofdGRS, as shown in Fig. 14. As we expected, predictions
are far away from accurate (although, in cases such as #1,
they are at least aligned with the actual values). Figure 14 pro-
vides a good understanding of how the initial approximations
may vary from one another. While case #1in the Fig. 14a is
an example of relatively good initial approximation, case #9
shown in Fig. 14b is a poor initialization for the input-output
relationship. We recognize that the better the understanding
about the relationship between inputs and output, the better the
initialization of the trainable parameters can be. Nevertheless,
even the simplistic approach defined by Eq. 11 is still useful

as a way to initialize the trainable parameters.
After initializing the weights, the multilayer perceptron is in-
tegrated into the recurrent neural network. Then, observed
grease damage dGRS, wind speed, and main bearing temper-
ature are used to train the model. Figure 15 summarizes the
collected observations of grease damage, dGRSthroughout
the set of 10 turbines used to train our physics-informed neural
network. As mentioned before, grease damage is collected
monthly over a six-month period. The dashed lines illustrates
the actualdGRStrends (which is never fully observed). dGRS
does not evolve at the same rate across the turbines in the
training set due to difference in the operating conditions (wind
speed and main bearing temperature).
Figure 16 shows the change in the loss function during the
training phase. After only a few epochs, all cases can converge

to a value, which could indicate the ability of rapid learning of
the model. However, it is clear that some cases lead to smaller
values of the loss function (highlighting the importance of
proper initialization of the neural network hyper-parameters).
The computational cost for each training process is ap-
proximately 8 minutes for 10 wind turbines. Note thatprediction takes approximately 6 minutes per turbine, since
we forecast up to 30 years.
Figure 16. Loss function variation per epoch for all cases.
Figure 17 illustrates the prediction capability of recurrent neu-
ral network before training, after training, and with validation
turbines for two different cases. Given the simplistic initializa-
tion of the multilayer perceptron, we should expect inaccurate
estimations without training. Blue data points in Fig. 17 show
the inaccuracy of the model before it is trained. After we train
the model, we expect that predictions improve when com-
pared to the predictions before training. Although that is true
in general; the results greatly vary with the planes used for
initialization of the multilayer perceptron. As shown by the
red points in Fig. 17, while case #1has predicted values very
close to the actual ones; this is not true for case #9. The black
data points in Fig. 17 show the results for the four turbines set
aside for validation. Overall, it is safe to say the model can
learn thedGRSpropagation depending on the initialization of
the multilayer perceptron.
Figure 18 presents all the 10 cases of initialization of trainable
parameters (following Eq. 11). The results are very good
for 4 out of 10 cases ( #1,#2,#3, and #10), fairly well
for another 3 cases ( #4,#5, and #7), and poor for the re-
maining 3 cases ( #6,#8, and #9). It can be inferred from
Fig. 18a that the model tends to overestimate the damage in
the almost all cases. This tendency provides a slight degree
of conservatism to the model (which might be tolerable for
this application). We believe this behavior is related to the
configuration and initialization of the multilayer perceptrons.
Figure 18b highlights the prediction errors for the top 5 best
cases of parameter initializations (i.e., cases #1,#2,#3,#7,
and#10). We can conclude that the parameter initialization
strategy is effective5.
We then used the physics-informed neural network model
(Fig. 5) to estimate grease damage accumulation and main

with randomly assigned initial parameters. The task proved to be extremely
hard and we had no success even after trying several combinations of learning
rates and number of epochs.

bearing fatigue damage. Figure 19 illustrates the results of
three best and one mediocre training case from previous sim-
ulations (cases #1,#3,#10, and #7, respectively). Figure
19a shows the prediction results of the recurrent neural net-
work predictions and actual grease damage over time. Grease
damage,dGRS, gets reset back down to zero (regardless of the
current damage level) since the bearing is fully regreased every
6 months. As expected, the models tend to be conservative and
the model coming out of case #7performs poorly indeed. The
conservatism in dGRSestimation is reflected on the bearing
fatigue damage accumulation. Figure 19b illustrates the actual
and predicted main bearing fatigue damage accumulation (pre-
dictions coming from the same cases previously discussed).
There are also two additional curves that work as bounds for
bearing fatigue estimation. The solid-red and solid-green lines
show results when fully degraded and non-damaged (virgin)
grease curves are used throughout the predictions. It is then
clear that the accelerated grease damage accumulation short-
ens the bearing fatigue life as well. The grease damage models

when it actually happens (out of roughly 16 years of total life).
Up until now, we demonstrated that initializing the multilayer
perceptron with the scheme we propose in section 3.4 can help
the optimization of the network hyper-parameters. Next, we
used cross-validation to help with two important tasks: assess-
ing model accuracy and selecting best model in a set (Kohavi,
1995). We considered only the best initial guess for each ar-
chitecture shown in Tab. 3. In order to keep the computational
cost low, we used leave-one-out cross-validation. In this part
of the study, we used the multilayer perceptron architectures
detailed in Tab. 3 We fixed our initial plane approximation to
case#3, for the sake of providing consistency across all multi-
layer perceptron models, and this way, isolating the influence
of the architectural difference.
Figure 20 illustrates the results of the cross-validation study.
Figure 20a shows how the cross-validation predictions com-
pare against the actual grease damage for the different mul-
tilayer architectures. There is only marginal differences be-
tween the performance of each architecture. Figure 20b il-
lustrates the cross-validation errors against the actual grease
damage. All models tend to underestimate small values of
grease damage and overestimate the large ones (which is a
tolerable/desirable feature for this application).
In addition, when we compare root mean square errors for
validation and cross-validation in Fig. 21. Given that cumu-
lative damage varies from 0to1, the fact that the root mean
square errors vary between roughly 0:01and0:018reinforces

that the discrepancy in among different architectures is in-
significant. Nevertheless, as expected, one could use the root
mean square error out of cross validation to select one of the
architectures (agreement between ranking from validation and
cross validation).
5. S UMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In this contribution, we modeled wind turbine main bearing fa-
tigue damage accumulation through recurrent neural networks.
Our approach is hybrid and fuses physics-informed kernels
with data-driven layers. Specifically, we modeled bearing
fatigue damage through a equations commonly used in design
for bearing reliability and grease damage increment through
a multi-layer perceptron. Then, we presented a series of nu-
merical studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed
framework. This way, the data-driven layer compensates for
the limited understanding of the physics when it comes to
grease degradation.
The case study was designed such that (a) 10-minute average
operational (SCADA) data is available for a set of 14 wind

turbines, and (b) grease inspection is performed monthly in
a subset of 10 of those 14 turbines. With the help of this
numerical study, we learned that:
•initialization of the weights of multilayer perceptron is
crucial: a set of initial weights that is far away from
optimum would not lead to accurate predictions,
•the dependency of initial weights can be overcome through
engineering judgement-based weight initialization,
•provided a plausible initial point, artificial neural net-
works can capture the grease degradation trend with a
small error (after training with only few observation points),
•the predictions for grease damage are slightly conserva-
tive; however, that trend is revealed while performing
cross-validation analysis, and
•for this particular problem and data set, different levels of

multilayer perceptron complexity do not seem to affect
the model performance significantly as shown with a
cross-validation study (as in a long term bearing fatigue
prediction, deviation is about less than a month).
The results motivate us to extended the study in several as-
pects. For example, we suggest studying the effect of im-
proved physics of failure models (e.g., by improving bear-
ing fatigue modeling). We also suggest addressing multiple
sources of uncertainty within the model and proposing ways
to handle them using deep neural networks. For example,
one can study the uncertainty in the loads model including
the ratio of time between rated power versus curtailment op-
eration and factors such as yaw misalignment, poor under-
standing of aerodynamic boundary conditions, and fidelity
level of multi-body simulations. Finally, one can also study
how this physics-informed neural networks could be used
to help decision making in fleet management of industrial
assets (inspection optimization, fleet recommissioning, and
repair/replacement).

Felipe A. C. Viana is currently an assistant professor at the
University of Central Florida (UCF). The vast majority of Dr.
Viana’s work has been applied to new designs and improve-
ment of fielded products with a focus on aircraft propulsion,
power generation, and oil and gas systems. Before joining
UCF, Dr. Viana was a Sr. Scientist at GE Renewable Energy,
where he led the development of state-of-the-art computational
methods for improving wind energy asset performance and re-
liability. Prior to moving to that role at GE, he spent five years
at GE Global Research, where he led and conducted research
on design and optimization under uncertainty, probabilistic
analysis of engineering systems, and services engineering.
APPENDICES
Grease Degradation
Grease degradation is an extremely complex phenomenon to
understand, let alone model. In this paper, we adopted a simpli-fied model found in Klueber-contributors (2011). The model
relates grease life with bearing temperature and a number of
adjustment factors:
LGRS
nm =LGRS
nmKNKBF1F2F3F4F5F6 (12)
Figure 22a illustrates how grease service life varies with tem-
perature. Most adjustment factors are given in Tab. 4. F3
is a factor that accounts for dynamic load variation and it is
shown in Fig. 22b. As stated by Lugt (2009), the bearing life
is commonly expressed in terms of L10 life (as a safety factor
to account for the variation in grease properties).

Data Augmentation
Wind turbines are equipped with supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) systems, which most commonly records
sensor and controls data every 10 minutes. For the sake of
this study, wind speed and main bearing temperature would
be available through SCADA on a turbine-by-turbine basis

across the entire fleet of interest. Here we built synthetic data
starting from a database made available by NREL. The NREL
database has ambient temperature and wind speed at 80 meters
recorded at every hour.
To mimic recorded SCADA data, we bootstrapped data from
the original NREL database. Each day is represented by eight
bins of three hours segments and each bin aggregates a week
worth of data. In other words, each bin has 21 data points
coming from the same 3 hours of the day across a week. We
then sample at random (with replacement) from this pool to
fill in the extra 5 points per hour needed within each bin. This
process is repeated with a sliding weekly window throughout
the year so that seasonality is preserved.
While the NREL database covers seven years (from 2007 to
2013), some of our simulations needed data for up to 30 years.
To overcome this limitation and also to provide a mechanism
for forecasting damage accumulation. Again, we bootstrapped
from the previously augmented data binning it at every then
minutes by time of the day and day of the year across the seven
years. We calculated the mean and standard deviation of each
bin and assuming normal distribution, we sampled data points
for the same time stamp of the forecasted year.
Bearing Temperature Calculation
While main bearing temperature would be available through
SCADA, in our study we had to estimate it (as it was not
available in the NREL database). In this study, we leveraged
the model proposed by Cambron et al. (2017). In essence, the
main bearing temperature is described by a recursive model
as a function of previous bearing temperature, nacelle temper-
ature, angular velocity, and generated power value:
TBRG(t) =1TBRG(t 1) +2TNacelle (t)
+3N2(t) +4Pwr(t)(13)
•TBRG is the bearing temperature (K)
•TNacelle is the nacelle temperature (K)
•Nis the angular velocity (rad/s)
•Pwr is the power generated (MW), and•iare the regression coefficients, see Tab. 5.

3 0.0115 K s2/rad2
4 0.0146 K/MW
Table 5. Regression coefficients for recursive bearing temper-
ature model (Cambron et al., 2017).
Most terms in Eq. (13) are easily estimated using the NREL
database.NandPwr come from passing the wind speed
through the curves shown in Fig. 7. TNacelle is not available
in the NREL database, but we modeled it as a linear function
of ambient temperature:
TNacelle (t) = 0:5TAmbient (t) + 250 (14)
The coefficients of Eq. 14 were estimated by mapping min-
imum and maximum ambient temperature and main bearing
temperature at the location reported by Cambron et al. (2017).
Activation Functions
In this study, we used the sigmoid and the exponential linear
unit (elu) activation functions within the multilayer perceptron
layers. These functions are given as follows and Fig. 23
illustrates these activation functions.
