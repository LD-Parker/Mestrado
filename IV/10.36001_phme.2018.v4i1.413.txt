ABSTRACT  
A wind turbine is a representative machine with varying 
rotational speed because unpredictable natural wind is a locomotive force of the rotation. Major mechanical 
components of the drive train such as bearings encounter varying and irregular loadings in a ccordance with the 
variation of the rotational speed. Therefore, the varying and 
irregular loadings are a critical factor to be considered for the life prediction of the bearings. The degradation processes for 
constant and varying loadings are measured in order to 
evaluate the characteristics. An efficient index to stand for the 
state of bearing is also suggested in the combination of 
measured vibration, temperature and torque. Then, two method s, which can be used with and without model 
information respecti vely, are proposed to predict the life in 
the case of varying loading. The proposed method s are  
validated for the several experimental results and expected for the practical application of condition monitoring.  
1. I
NTRODUCTION  
An essential element to realize the rotational motion for  most 
of machines is a lubricating element  such as a bearing, which 
minimizes the friction . Bearings can be divided into fluid 
lubricated bearings that utilize the dynamic pressure of the 
fluid , and rolling element bearings with direct friction of the 
machine elements. Among these, a rolling element bearing 
used at a relatively small load reduces frictions through 
rolling motion between  the inner  and outer races . Then, t he 
rolling element bearing is exposed to various failures or 
fatigue because of the direct contact between the rolling 
element and the inner/outer ring s. Therefore, in order to 
improve the cost effectiveness of maintenance, the rolling 
element bearings have been the top priority for the failure 
diagnosis and the life prediction among  the machine part s. 
In recent years, various studies have been proposed to predict 
the remaining useful life (RUL) in accordance with the results 
of real -time measur ement s. The first step in life prediction is 
to determine a state index that can quantitatively represent the state of the bearing  (ISO, 2004) . In recent researches, 
Boskoski  (2015) used the root mean square (RMS) value of 
the bearing vibration  as a state index. The well-known  
features such as kurtosis  and fault frequency of bearing are 
also used for the prediction  (Ali, 2015) . 
The predict ion of the state index, which is the last stage of 
bearing life prediction, can be performed  by a simple curve -
fitting (Seo, 2017), using a filter ( Xi, 2013 ), or obtaining a 
regression curve using various probability distribution 
models  (Xi, 2011). Gebraeel  (2005) proposed a method for 
predicting RUL , assuming model parameter s of an 
exponential function  as normal distributions. However, the 
above methods  are only for the constant loading. Therefore, 
an additional method is necessary for the application of 
bearing  in the wind turbine.  
In this paper, the analysis of degradation characteristics is 
carried o ut on the basis of actual degradation tests and the 
determination of a state index  is suggested. Then, the concept 
of data acquisition to apply two prediction methods to a wind 
turbine is explained. In order to v alidate  the performance of 
the proposed meth ods, RUL  is predicted and the RMS errors 
are evaluated . 
2. CHARACTERIZATION OF DEGRADATION  
The most important i nformation for the prediction of life is 
characteristics of degradation with respect to time. The shape 
of degradation signal with respect to time, and effect of 
various loading and environmental conditions are the 
required knowledge in order to predict life time perfectly. As 
the first step , degradation test s of bearings up to failure with 
constant loading and rotational speed  are performed. Then, 
alternating  loading is also applied  on degradation tests for the 
same bearing model.  
2.1. Apparatus of D egradation Tests of Bearings  
Degradation tests of bearing s are performed in the laboratory 
by the many r esearch teams  (CWRU, 2017; NASA, 2017; 
KSPHM, 2018) . In general, radial force is applied into 
bearing with the rotation of a shaft. At that time, some 
physical parameters such as vibration and temperature are measured. In this research, vibration, temperat ure and torque

2 for the rotation are chosen as measured parameters. Radial 
and axial forces are made by feedback controlled hydraulic 
actuators. A pair of bearings as test specimens is located on 
the both ends of a rotating shaft. Another pair of bearings a s 
support bearings is  installed in the middle of the shaft so as 
to guarantee stable force exertion. If radial and axial actuator s 
apply _r actF  and _a actF  in this layout , then each of test 
bearings is loaded by _ 1/2r r act FF=  and _ a a actFF= , 
respectively.  The vibrations of two testing bearings are 
measured by accelerometers with respect to axial direction, 
respectively. Temperatures  on the surface of the outer race 
and torque to rotate the shaft are also acqui red. Figure 1 
shows a conceptual diagram and locations of sensors for the 
degradation test.  Detailed specifications of test bearing are 
summarized on the Table 1.

2.2. Determination of State Index  
Representative physical parameters, which show the state of 
bearing for prediction of  life, are vibration, temperature, 
acoustic emission, ultrasonic, thermography and so on  (Zhou, 
2016). If simple diagnosis and prognosis are carried out, only one of the above parameters might be used as a single state index. But a combination of the above parameters is more 
effective to represent the accurate state. The uncertainties  (or 
hidden characteristics)  are complicated phenomenon and 
they are not easy to be identified analytically and 
experimentally. Therefore, utilization of various measurable 
parameters can guarantee to reduce various uncertainties 
which are originated from environme ntal condition, loading 
and measurement equipment  (Sankararaman , 2015) . Figure 2 shows root mean square  (RMS) of vibration with 
respect to time when constant forces are applied to bearings. 
As time goes by, magnitude of vibration beco mes larger 
monotonically. However, the slope and change of increase 
are random and there are some peaks whose cause is not 
identified yet. Fault frequencies of bearing are good for 
diagnosis but RMS is simple and sufficient  to represent 
amount of degradation. Figure 3 also shows operational data 
of bearing such as temperature and torque. In initial stage, the 
overshoots of temperature and torque exist before it becomes  
steady -state. After about 17 hours , temperature of bearing 
become increasing a little, and soar of temperature happens 
at the end of degradation test. Because vibration, temperature 
and torque show the degradation trend of a bearing, a 
combination of them can be used as a state index of th e 
bearing.

An efficient method to consider all of vibration, temperature 
and torque is to use a weighted linear combination like below

3 where V, T and Tor are normalized RMS of vi bration, 
temperature and torque, respectively. Since actual measured 
values have different units , it is necessary to normalize the 
measured value. If weighting factors  (aw,bw and cw) has , in 
addition,  any values from 0 to 1, the state index  (SI) can be  
assumed as less than 1. Then, a unity of SI can be defined as 
the end of life , which is a reference value to predict the life 
of bearing.  
Before determin ing weighting factors  (aw,bw and cw), a 
degradation model has to be chosen. The degradation model 
is a mathe matical model of a state index for  the prediction of 
life. In this paper, an exponential function with respect to 
time is selected among the various degradation models 
because the exponential function is easy to be manipulated 
and applied in  the case of the normal distribution . The 
exponential function is defined by  
 ()()btSI t f t ae cε+= = +  , (2) 
where a, b and c are model parameters which are 
expressed as probability distributions , and ε stands for 
measurement noise . ε is also defined as a probability 
distribution.  
When the state index is assumed to be an exponential 
function, the weighting factors are determined by optimization, in which the state index has the highest correlation coefficient  with the exponential function.  The 
number of degradation tests is 
N, the life time of ith test 
specimen is iLT, and a measured state index, which is made 
by a weighting factor, during the degradation test can be represented by a vector form as

3. LIFE PREDICTION OF BEARING  IN WIND TURBINE  
3.1. Concept of Bin for Condition Monitoring of Wind 
Turbine  
Because a wind turbine is forced by natural wind, the 
rotational speed of the wind turbine, which is determined by 
wind speed, continues to vary. As damage detection methods 
of a rotating machine were generally developed for constant 
speed, an additional p rocedure to the condition monitoring 
and diagnosis  is needed in order to apply it to the wind 
turbine. In this paper, the concept of bin is chosen as a tool to 
consider the characteristic of varying rotational speed. The 
bin was proposed by IEC 61400- 25-6 to implement the 
efficient triggering for storing data of condition monitoring system  (CMS)  as it is shown in Figure 4. 
Bin is a statistical term to represent a range of a variable. If a 
variable stays within a selected range, which i s called as a 
bin, for a certain term, we can consider that the variable 
belongs to the bin. Similarly, if operational condition of a wind turbine stays within a range defined by operator for a 
certain term, the state s of the wind turbine can be considered  
as being quasi -stationary although real operational conditions 
of the wind turbine continue to vary in accordance to the 
speed of wind. If the concept of bin is applied to the condition 
monitoring of a wind turbine, the condition monitoring  is not 
always carried out for all the operational conditions. Instead, 
the condition monitoring  is executed when an operational 
condition, which is exemplified by generated power of the 
wind turbine  in Figure 4, stays in the bins  for a certain term . 
 
Figure 4 Concept of Power Bin  (IEC 61400- 25-6) 
 
By using above the concept of bin, the prediction of life is 
realized as if wind turbine is a rotating machine with constant 
load and speed. Therefore, t he techniques of life pred iction in 
the case of constant load and speed are able to be applied to 
a rotational machine with variable speed.

4 3.2. Curve -fit Approach 
One of t he simplest way to predict the life of bearing is  to 
make a fitting function instantly with most recent data  (Seo,  
2017) . After a term  of time for fitting is specified, curve -
fitting with an exponential function  as Eq . (2) is carried out. 
The fitted function from the curve -fitting reveals a possible 
trajectory of state index  (SI) from current time to infinite time. 
Therefore, SI at the current time can be estimated and 
remaining useful life  (RUL ) is predicted by calculating  the 
time that the fitted function is equal to a unit, which means 
the end of life . 
In this method, the time term used in fitting should be 
specified. If the time duration is too short, prediction result 
becomes much sensitive to instant variation. If the time 
duration is too long, the prediction result do not change and 
measurements become meaningless. In this paper, the best time duration for fitting is chosen by trial and error . However, 
the development of a systematic method is needed for 
application of  the proposed method in the future.  
3.3. Bayesian Approach  
There exist many methods to estimate a probabilistic  variable  
(
y) statistically. One of effective methods is Bayesian 
estimation by considering current measured data and prior 
information. This method calculates a maximum point of 
conditioned probability distribution with respect to measured 
data such as  
 () arg max Pr |y yx = ,  (8) 
When p rior distribution ,() Pry, of estimated variable exists, 
a posterior distribution, () Pr |yx , can be calculated by so -
called Baye’s rule like below  
 ()()()
()Pr | PrPr |Prxy yyxx×=   (9) 
If the intercept c in degradation model of  Eq. (2) is assumed 
to be a known constant, logarithm of both sides of Eq . (2) can 
be written as  (Gebraeel , 2005)  
 ()

where ()'nθ  and ()bn  are nth time step( current ) degradation 
model  variables. It is assumed that ()'nθ  and ()bn  have 
normal(Gaussian) distribution with mean values of ()0nµ  
and ()1nµ , and standard deviations of ()0nσ  and ()1nσ , 
respectively. In this paper, ()0nµ , ()1nµ , ()0nσ   and 
()1nσ  are expressed as 0µ, 1µ, 0σ and 1σ for simplicity, 
respectively.  On the other hands, if ()'nθ  and ()bn  are partly dependent 
to each other, a joint probability density function is defined by

4. EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLES  
4.1. Degradation Tests with Constant Load and S peed  
Degradation tests of 14 samples in the case of constant load 
and speed  (Table 2) are per formed and the life of each bearing 
is predicted by proposed methods in the previous sections. Although the conditions  of constant load and rotating speed 
are not the same as th ose of a real wind turbine, the model 
parameters, which are acquired in the constant conditions, 
can be applied to the variable loading case if the monitoring 
for the wind turbine is executed by using the concept of bin.  
 
Terminal condition of degradation test, which is listed on Table 3, is set in order to protect the equipment and consider 
operational range of machine elements. Moreover, each of 
the terminal condition s is used as a reference value to 
normalize the measured value which ar e described in Eq. (1). 
Table 4 shows the weighting factors to consist of state index, 
which is determined by optimization in Eq. (7).  Figure 5 
shows state indexes of 14 samples with the weighting factors 
in Table 4. It is sho wn that each of state indexes  has much 
difference  because there are uncertainties  (hidden 
characteristics)  that originate  from manufacturing tolerance, 
variation of environment , assembly error of test equipment 
and so on. Therefore, curve fitting and Bayesian approach  are 
effec tive to predict the life of bearing.  
Figure 6 and Figure 7 show histograms and fitted probability 
distributions of model parameter in Eq. (1)  for 14 degradation 
samples. Even if scattering  exists, their distributions are 
assumed to be normal distribution, and identified model parameters are shown in Table 5.

Figure 8 shows prediction result s of a sample among 14 
samples . In Figure 8, the results of curve -fitting approach is 
made when fitting term is 80 minutes  (40 data points) . 
Although the error of prediction is quite large, the error 
becomes smaller as operational time passes by. Since the 
curve –fitting approach is more sensitive to a n instant  
variation, the prediction result has some rapid changes. If 
fitting term is elongated, the rapid changes would become 
smoother but insensitive to any external variation.  If the 
external variation  is an instantaneous fluctuation such as 
measurement noise , its influence on the life is insignificant , 
and the insensitivity  (or robustness) of  prediction method is 
better. On the other hands, if the variation causes  a permanent 
effect , sensitive prediction is good for an accurate result. 
Therefore, t he fitting term is a hyper parameter  to be 
determined for the sake of proper prediction.  But, any  other 
information such as model parameters is not required for the 
curve -fitting approach . It is advantageous when a simple 
prediction method is needed or sufficient model  information 
does not exist.  
Figure 8, in addition, show s a prediction result by Bayesian 
approach for the same sample. While the RUL are 
underestimated, the prediction error becomes smaller  like the 
curve -fitting approach.  However, root mean square  error 
between true RUL and predicted one is much smaller than that of curve -fitting approach. Because Bayesian approach 
demand s more statistical model parameters such as Table 5 
than curve -fitting approach, the accuracy is superi or.

 4.2. Degradation tests  with two -step variable load and 
speed  
Because condition monitoring of a wind turbine is performed 
by using the concept of  bin, degradation tests with two -step 
variable loading and speed are executed. Test conditions are 
shown in Table 6 and alternat e time is 60 minutes. 
Degradation tests of 19 samples are carried out and Figure 9 
shows one (sample No. 6)  of 19 samples ’ state indexes  which 
are calculated with weighting  factors of  Table 4. Because 
state indexes in both bins show increasing trend by  
degradation , curve -fitting approach can be applied to the 
prediction of life. Similarly, since test conditions in Bin I are 
the same as the loading and speed in the previous constant condition, the state index of Bin I is possible to predict the 
life by using the Bayesian approach with the model 
information in Table 5. 
 
 
Figure 9 State Indexes of Degradation Tests with Two -step 
Load and Speed  
 
Figure 10 is prediction results of both curve -fitting and 
Bayesian approaches for two -step load and speed. The 
predictions are carried out only for  Step I load, which is 
equivalent to Bin I , in order to use the model parameters in 
Table 5. Eve n if the conditions of loading and speed alternate , 
both predictions show reasonable results because the life is 
influenced by cumulat ive loading. That is similar to famous 
Miner ’s rule in metal fatigue. Therefore, it is expected that 
the life prediction o f a mechanical component for the random 
loading of a wind  turbine is possible with the concept of  bin 
in terms of data acquisition and analysis.  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

7 Life predictions of several samples for two -step loading 
condition are performed and their results are shown in  Figure 
11. Generally, the Bayesian approach is more advantageous 
with respect to the accuracy of the prediction  because prior 
information is important for the prediction. But the complete 
predictions of all the cases are not possible. If the prior 
information is used without any updating, it is difficult to 
predict in the case of a bizarre sample. Therefore, a further 
study such as an effective updating method  is needed to 
manipulate an outlier of the  model.

5. CONCLUSION  
A wind turbine suffers various loadings and rotational speeds 
due to unpredictable natural wind. The life prediction of a 
bearing under the variable loading condition is w orthy for 
condition -based operation and maintenance. In this paper, 
degradation characteristics of bearings for constant loading 
and speed in terms of time are analyzed, and an exponential function is used as a degradation model. A weighted linear combinat ion of measured values is suggested as a state index 
to express the degradation model. Two methods such as curve -fitting and Bayesian prediction with the concept of a 
bin are proposed. While the curve -fitting is a simple method 
without any model informatio n, the Bayesian prediction with 
model information shows more accurate results. Because both proposed methods are complementary, It is expected 
that the two method s are useful to predict the life of a bearing  
practically.
