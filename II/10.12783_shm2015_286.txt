ABSTRACT  
 
This paper presents a study into the use of Gaussi an Process Latent Variable Models 
(GP-LVM) and Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) for detection of 
defects on wind turbine bearings using A coustic Emission (AE) data. The results 
presented have been taken from an experimental rig with a seed ed defect, to attempt to 
replicate an AE burst generated from a developing crack. Some of the results for both 
models are presented and compared, and it is shown that the GP -LVM, which is a 
nonlinear extension of PPCA, outperforms it in distinguishing AE b ursts generated from 
a defect over those  generated by other mechanisms.    
 
 
INTRODUCTION  
 
    The wind turbine industry has struggled with gearbox re liability since its early days. 
The study presented here focuses on fault detection on planetary bearings for high speed 
drivetrains in gearboxes. There is a clear advantage in pursuing a monitoring strategy in 
drivetrains , as failures are known to cause significant downtime  result ing in prohibitive 
costs.  Of the various drivetrain components, the planetary b earings have  a notoriously 
high failure rate and there is a tendency for these bearings to fail much below their 
prescribed fatigue  life. It is thought that this could possibly be because of overload 
events that put stresses outside the design limits  of th e bearings. While there are on -
going efforts to try and advance the understanding and modelling  of these loads  a sound 
monitoring strategy is clearly required in order to reduce the downtime of wind turbines.

    The results presented here are from an experimental study from a rig designed to 
replicate the operational conditions of a wind turbine planetary bearing. The 
arrangement during operation of this type of gearbox is show n in  
 
Figure  1. The experimental rig is representative of  the real -life setup , and  contains an 
inner bearing housed inside an outer support bearing. The key point from a reliability 
perspe ctive is that the inner rac eway of a  planet bearing  has a constant radial load, which 
means there is a relatively high stress concentration at this point, leading to poor 
reliability. It has been found in practice that once a defect from these inner raceways is 
detected through vibr ation monitoring it is already too late. AE monitoring is therefore 
desirable to identify the early onset of a crack . Using AE techniques for this application 
has been successfully studied and developed in [1] using large seeded defects (of 100 -
200 ùúáùëö ) and placing sensors on the inner raceway. However, it is not practical to place 
sensors directly on the planet bearings as these are constantly rotating . We thus wish to 
investigate the feasibility of performing AE monitoring by placing sensors o n the outer 
casing of the experimental rig. In order to generate AE from a realistic defect, a defect 
of approximately 5 ùúáùëö width has also been scribed on the inner raceway of the inner 
bearing using a cubic boron nitride grit.  
 
Acoustic Emission Data Ac quisition  
 
    Acoustic Emissions, when used within a Structural Health Monitoring (SHM ) or 
Non-Destru ctive Testing (NDT) context,  are high frequency stress waves that propagate 
through a material. These waves can be generated by a number of different mech anisms 
including stress, plastic deformation, friction and corrosion. A change in the internal 
structure of a solid will tend to generate AE waves, and monitoring these waves has 
been shown to be a successful method for detecting the early onset of cracks in various 
applications.  The AE data for this study has been gathered with a National Instruments 
cDAQ data acquisition system on an experimental rig. The transducers used were 
Physical Acoustics NANO -30 and MICRO -30D. All data has been collected at 1MHz.  
Several channels have been gathered at various locations around the rig, but for 
conciseness and  for the purpose of this study detecting from a single sensor, placed on 
the bearing housing at the bottom of the rig is demonstrated.

    Although the  opening of a crack, as well as its exposure to stress will lead to the 
propagation of acoustic waves through a material, the key challenge when trying to use 
these to reliably identify a crack, in partic ular within a large gearbox, is that there are 
many other processes generating  AE such as friction, roller impact and debris. This 
study therefore,  attempt s to detect  waves that have travelled through two layers of 
rollers, and two thick outer casing layer s. The use of periodicity of the bursts has been 
successfully used for detection of defects within the inner raceway [1], but in order to 
monitor from the outside, where the waves will be severely attenuated and not all of 
them may make it to the  sensor , different approaches have to be considered .  
Figure  2 shows an example AE response from a damaged bearing measured at the 
bearing housing. This illustrates the point that the AE response to a defect may be 
accompanied by numerous other AE generating mechanisms. An approach is presented 
here based on hit extraction , with a  discuss ion on  how GP-LVMs and PPCA  could be 
used to try to separate AE bursts belonging to a regular process to those belonging to a 
defec t.    The following sections give an overview of these models and discuss some of 
the results from the experimental rig.  
 
 
GAUSSIA N PROCESS LATENT VARIABLE MODEL S 
 
    It is outside the scope of this paper to fully discuss GP -LVMs, but the general 
concepts  are laid out here. The interested reader is referred to  [2]. Latent Variable 
models perform unsupervised  learning. The general idea is to represent a data set ùêò 
containing a large number of dimensions or variables, as a function of a new set ùêó, 
which will typically be of lower dimension.  The hidden, or latent, variables ùêó are said 
to generate  ùêò. The goal of this class of  model s is thus to find the  latent va riables, and to 
do so a suitable  map from ùêó to ùêò (or vice -versa)  must be found .  If this map is a linear 
function, it is referred to as  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Factor Analysis  
[3]. These have been used extensively within the SHM  and condition monitoring 
community as dimensionality reduction  techniques for data exploration , PCA has also 
proven useful for tasks such a s normali sing out environmental effects in SHM data  [4].  

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
The next section will briefly discuss the back ground of Probabilis tic PCA (PPCA) , 
which will help the unfamiliar reader better  grasp the concept of the GP -LVM .  
 
Probabilistic PCA  
 
   The goal in traditional PCA is to find a reduced set of variables that explain most of 
the variability in the observed data space  ùêò. This is typically achieved using an eigen -
decomposition of the covariance structure of the  dataset  ùêò.  The resulting  mapping from 
ùêò to ùêó is such that the eigenvectors with the highest  eigenvalues  provide a mapping  
which  aims to  capture most of the v ariability in the data. PCA is used for data 
visuali sation  by taking sufficient eigenvalues so that a high percentage of the variance 
in the data is captured. This approach to visuali sing AE data  has been investigated and 
proven to be useful, for exampl e, for identifying cracks in aircraft landing gears [5].  
      PCA can be modelled as a Linear Gaussian Model, and  doing  so brings several 
benef its. The extension is simple, and involves mode lling the uncertainty  over the 
observation  process as Gaussian:    
 
 ùêò=Cùêó+ùúñ (1) 
                                                                 
where ùêò and ùêó are the observed and latent variables  respective ly, C is a matri x providing 
the linear map between ùêó and ùêò and ùúñ is an observation  noise term, which is mode lled 
as Gaussian  with zero mean and a covariance R. If this covariance is constrained to be 
of the form ùúé2I  (a matrix with the same variance along the diagonals) then this model 
is eq uivalent to PCA. The key point in this study is the proba bilistic interpretation of 
this model , which can be brou ght by a simple  formulation of its  marginal likelihood . 
For PCA, this is relatively st raightforward and can be shown [3] to be:  
 
 P(ùêò|C,œÉ2)=ùëÅ(ùúá |CC‚ä∫+œÉ2I) (2) 
which is Gaussian distributed with mean ùúá and covariance CC‚ä∫+ùúé2I.  Equation  (2) 
describes the probability of any observed data point given the latent variable m odel. The 
training phase  for Probabilistic PCA is achiev ed using the Expectation Maximiz ation 
(EM) algorithm , which is an iterative optimi sation scheme  that maximi ses the likelihood 
of the model.   
 
From PCA to  GP-LVMs  
 
      Probabilistic PCA is a simple yet very useful model, with its simplicity com ing from 
the fact that the map from X to Y is linear, and the observation noise is modelled  as 
Gaussian. These are , however,  two obvious limitations. There exist nonlinear extensions 
of PCA, with the A utoencode r, based on Neural Network Regression  being one of the 
most notable ones. Autoencoders have  been successful ly applied in SHM contexts [6], 
but have  the general disadvantage of long training times, large numb er of training points 
required,  a tendency to over -fit data  and most importantly in this case, they are not 
probabilistic.  
 
      Gaussian  Process R egression (GPR)  [7] is a non-parametric  regression technique , 
which means no model form is requ ired a -priori to model the data. This is a major 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
advant age. A Gaussian  Process (GP) is defined as a probability distribution over 
functions, and regr ession is performed by conditioning those functions that pass close 
to the observed data points  using simple Bayesian relationships [7]. The probability 
distribution of these functions  is specified by a covariance function , also often called 
the kernel .  The task of the covariance function is to encode the relationship between 
input and output points and it does so by specifying how all points in the output space 
ùêò vary together, as a function of how points in the input space ùêó vary together. This is 
shown in Equation ( 3) for a squared exponential  kernel:  
 
                                       ùëêùëúùë£ (ùëì(ùë•ùëñ),ùëì(ùë•ùëó))= ùëò(ùë•ùëñ,ùë•ùëó)=  œÉf2 exp (‚àí |ùë•ùëñ‚àíùë•ùëó|2
2ùëô) (3) 
  
 
where ùëì(ùë•ùëñ) is an output corresponding to input ùë•ùëñ, ùëô is a length -scale parameter, and 
œÉf2 is a noise variance parameter. The squared exponential is a popular choice of kernel 
amongst the GP community, although many more exist ; investigating the different 
choices is outside the scope of this paper . The covariance function is used to build a  
covariance matrix, denoted as  ùêæ(ùëø,ùëø‚Ä≤), which is simply an evaluation of the 
covariance function for all points in ùêó and an alternate set denoted by ùêó‚Ä≤. The key 
advantage of the GP is that predictions are pr obabilistic, so that  given a set of training 
inputs ùêó, test inputs ùêó‚àó and a covariance function, one can formulate a  predictive  
distribution : 
 
 
where ùëì‚àó is the mean of the predictions, cov(ùëì‚àó) is the variance, or uncertainty  aroun d 
those predictions.  
      The idea behind GP -LVMs is rather simple; instead of using a linear map between 
the latent  variables ùêó and the observed variables  ùêò, as is done in PCA using Equation 1 
(which is essentially a linear  regression problem) , a GP  is used ‚Äì therefore gaining a 
naturally probabilistic approach to the regression problem . This idea was developed in 
[2],  originally with dimensionality reduction in mind.  Different optimi sation schemes 
can be used for this  ‚Äì a scaled conjugate gradient was used in this study for the 
optimi sation of the GP -LVM latent variables, and EM was used for optimi sation of 
PPCA parameters.  
 
Density Estimation using PPCA and GPLVMs  
 
      The approach presented here is to first learn a latent vari able model using AE data 
from an undamaged bearing, and then when a new data point is presented, evaluate the 
likelihood  ‚Ñí, of the new data point, which can be interpreted as the probability density  
of the data point belonging to the model. It is in fact m ore practical to work with the 
negative log likelihood. For a new  (multivariate)  data point ùê≤, for PPCA, this is  
                                               ùëì‚àó = ùêæ(ùëã‚àó,ùëã)[ùêæ(ùëã,ùëã)+ùúéùëõ2ùêº ]‚àí1 ùê≤           
 
                                     cov(ùëì‚àó)=ùêæ(ùëã‚àó,ùëã)[ùêæ(ùëã,ùëã)+ ùúéùëõ2ùêº]‚àí1 ùêæ(ùëã,ùëã‚àó)    (4)

,where S=(CC‚ä∫+œÉ2I), as specified in Equation  2, ùùÅ is simply the mea n vector of the 
(baseline) data, and ùê≤ is a column vector .  For the GP -LVM , the densit y is given by  [2]: 
 
                                     ‚àílog ‚Ñí=  ùê∑ùëÅ
2ln2ùúã+ùê∑
2ln|K|+1
2ùë°ùëü(K‚àí1ùê≤‚ä∫ùê≤)  (7) 
 
where, K is the covariance matrix built using  ùêó from the training set ,  ùê∑ is the di mension 
of the latent space,  N is the number of points  and ùë°ùëü(ùë•) denotes the trace operator . It is 
the evaluation of these two functions that we wish to perform o n training, testing and 
damaged data points.  The data sets used for training and testing both correspond to 
undamaged data.  
 
 
APPLICATION TO FAULT DETECTION  
 
      This section discusses  the use of  GP-LVM and Probabilistic PCA models for fault 
detection from AE data on the experimental wind turbine bearing  rig. The data gathering 
and the rig setup have been discussed in a previous section, so the focus of this section 
is on the data pre -processing, the application of the  PPCA and GP -LVM as density 
estimators , and discussion of the  results. The results shown here have been taken from 
a single sensor on the outer casing of the bearing  test rig. Each time series was pre -
processed to extract basic  multivariate  features from the A E response. Different hits 
were extracted b y threshold ing the complex Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) of 
the raw time histories, at a scale corresponding to approximately 150 kHz.   The f eatures 
chosen to then represent each hit were m aximum amplitude, power, energy, duration, 
rise time (to max amplitude) and decay time.  In order to get an accurate estimate of the 
onset of the signal , an Akaike Information Criteria  (AIC) [8] detection scheme was used 
as described in [9].

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
     The general approach for performing fault detection using these models is to train 
them using a set of data from an unda maged bearing, test their generalisation 
performance using a different set of data still from an undamaged bearing, and finally 
test their ability to highlight defects from a damaged bearing. The measure of 
discordancy used here has been the model likeliho ods for both PPCA and GP -LVM as 
described in Equations 6 and 7.  Figure 3 shows the negative likelihood evaluated for 
both models using hit data extracted from the  training set, the testing set, and damaged 
set.  
     Note that both training and testing sets contain hits extracted from 15 seconds wort h 
of AE data, each. The damaged  set contains 30 seconds worth of data. The threshold 
shown in Figure 3 represents the 99.9th percentile of the training data, and we define an 
outlier here as an exceedance of that threshold.  
 
 
Discussion of Results  
 
      Note that the success or otherwise of these models is dictated largely by the features 
used to train them. In this study we have selected rather simple features extracted from 
the time domain of each hit. Significant domain knowledge has therefore been used in 
the hit extraction process simplifying the task of the density estima tor. It would be 
desirable, and left as further work to investigate this approach using richer features.  
      It is evident that a GP -LVM outperforms PPCA in detecting outliers  on damaged 
data. However, it also has more false positives in the test data se t. To put these  results 
in greater context, one would expect  for these tests 15 outlying points per second, as this 
is the roller pass rate over the defect.  The GP -LVM is clearly detecting more.  This 
could be  over-fitting from the model , from genuine seco ndary AE bursts  from the 
defect, or  from defects away from the loaded zone . In the inner raceway bearing used 
for this test, there are two more seeded defects, significantly away from the loaded zone. 
These sometimes also generate AE responses.  
      It is likely that the GP -LVM is over -fitting in this case. One can observe in Figure 3 
b) that the training points are very concentrated compared to the damaged data, for the 
case of GP -LVM. PPCA on the  other hand woul d appear to have outliers within the 
training set. Investigating these by hand shows that the outliers within the PPCA training 
set are hits so close to each other that they have been extracted as a single hit. This is in 
fact, a genuine outlier. This high lights that although the GP -LVM is able to capture 
more  complexity within the training set, in doing so it assigns a high density even to 
outliers.

Damaged * 88 3 5.8 39.7 2.02%  13.86%  
 
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
The result of this is the GP -LVM being sensitive to data from a d amaged condit ion, but 
also being so sensitive that it marks many false positive s. This is evident in Table I.  
      Note carefully that the comparative results in Table I give a comparison using the 
99.9th percentile of the training data as a threshold fo r an outlier. A sensitivity analysis 
of a threshold setting is outside the scope of this paper. However, it is worth noting that 
in the case of PPCA, which captures outliers within the training set, a much lower 
threshold is required for it to highlight al l the damaged points. In the case of the GP -
LVM, a threshold that is much further away from the training points is required since 
the training poin ts are very tightly distributed while the outliers are separated 
significantly.   
 
 
CONCLUSIONS  
 
      The GP -LVM was not originally designed to perform density estimation, it was 
designed as a tool for data exploration through dimensionality reduction. It has been  
shown here that it can successfully  detect the AE bursts originating from a 5 ùúáùëö defect 
scribed on an inner raceway, by monitorin g outside, on the bearing housing . A 
comparison between the density estimation from a GP -LVM and PPCA has been 
presented, showing that the GP -LVM  can discriminate better between different sources 
of data compared with its linear counterpart - PPCA. Its sensitivity however  also causes 
the GP -LVM to flag more false positives. There are several aspects that require further 
investigation, including sensitivity to threshold settings, features used, use of 
localisation, analy sis of data collected from an in -service gearbox and extensions of 
these models that better model the density.
