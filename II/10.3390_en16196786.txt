Abstract: Gearbox fault deterioration can signiﬁcantly impact the safety, reliability, and efﬁciency of
wind turbines, resulting in substantial economic losses for wind farms. However, current condition
monitoring methods face challenges in effectively mining the hidden spatio-temporal features within
SCADA data and establishing reasonable weight allocations for model input variables. To tackle these
issues, we proposed a novel condition monitoring method for wind turbine gearboxes called HBCE,
which integrated a feature-time hybrid attention mechanism (HA), the bidirectional convolutional
long short-term memory networks (BiConvLSTM), and an improved exponentially weighted moving-
average (iEWMA). Speciﬁcally, utilizing historical health SCADA data acquired through the modiﬁed
Thompson tau data-cleaning algorithm, a normal behavior model (HA-BiConvLSTM) of gearbox was
constructed to effectively extract the spatio-temporal features and learn normal behavior patterns.
An iEWMA-based outlier detection approach was employed to set dynamic adaptive thresholds,
and real-time monitor the prediction residuals of HA-BiConvLSTM to identify the early faults of
gearbox. The proposed HBCE method was validated through actual gearbox faults and compared
with conventional spatio-temporal models (i.e., CNN-LSTM and CNN&LSTM). The results illustrated
that the constructed HA-BiConvLSTM model achieved superior prediction precision in terms of
RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and R2, and the proposed method HBCE can effectively and reliably identify
early anomalies of a wind turbine gearbox in advance.

1. Introduction
Predictive maintenance aims to realize the detection of abnormal conditions for wind
turbine key components such as blade, main bearings, gearbox, and generator, by real-
time condition monitoring and statistical analysis. Then, timely maintenance measures
can be taken to eliminate hidden dangers at the early stage of faults, preventing further
expansion of faults and even catastrophic accidents [ 1]. As one of the key technologies
of predictive maintenance, wind turbine condition monitoring (WTCM) has become an
important research hotspot in the past decade [ 2]. By online monitoring, the operation
conditions of wind turbine key components to issue early fault alarms is an effective
way to improve the safety and reliability of wind turbines, and reduce the operation and
maintenance (O&M) costs of wind farm [3].
Condition monitoring methods for wind turbines can be broadly categorized into three
groups: empirical knowledge-based methods [ 4,5], physical model-based methods [ 6–8],
and data driven-based methods [ 9–11]. Empirical knowledge-based methods have disad-
vantages of excessive dependence on the knowledge and experience of domain experts,
making it difﬁcult to mine complex and highly reliable equipment failure mechanism
features, and have signiﬁcant limitations with the application in the WTCM ﬁeld. With the
increasing size and unit capacity of wind turbines, high complexity and strong coupling

between different subsystems make it difﬁcult to establish accurate mathematical models
for key components by physical model-based methods, which often results in unsatisﬁed
monitoring performance. Different from empirical knowledge-based methods and physical
model-based methods, data driven-based methods do not require massive priori knowl-
edge or to establish an accurate mathematical model. They can learn the operating rules of
wind turbines under health conditions by only mining spatio-temporal features inherent in
massive high-dimensional SCADA operating data, and construct normal behavior models
to carry out online condition monitoring for wind turbine key components, which make
them research hotspots and they have achieved a widespread application in the WTCM
ﬁeld recently.
With the rapid development of sensor technologies based on vibration signals [ 12–14],
oil signals [ 15], acoustic signals [ 16,17], and infrared thermal image [ 18,19], etc., numerous
data driven WTCM methods were proposed for wind turbine key components and achieved
good anomaly detection results. However, the above-mentioned methods often require
installations of additional hardware such as acquisition, transmission, and storage, which
is costly and difﬁcult to fully popularize.
In order to ensure the daily management of wind farms and the effective operation
and maintenance of wind turbines, most wind farms have implemented the supervisory
control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. The SCADA system records abundant
operation condition parameters of wind turbines (e.g., main bearing temperature, gearbox
oil temperature, generator speed, and active power), and external environmental conditions
information (e.g., wind speed, wind direction, temperature, humidity, and pressure). Due
to its advantages of massive high-dimensional, easy-access, and low-cost characteristics,
SCADA data have been widely used for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of
wind turbines.
Traditional SCADA-based data driven methods, which utilize conventional machine
learning algorithms such as back-propagation neural network (BPNN) [ 11], support vector
machine (SVM) [ 20], transfer learning (TL) [ 21], isolation forest (IF) [ 22], Gaussian process
(GP) [ 10], and XGBoost [ 23], have been employed to monitor operating conditions of wind
turbine key components. However, faced with massive high-dimensional, multi-source
heterogeneous SCADA data, it is often difﬁcult to mine the effective feature representa-
tions hidden in SCADA data with the above-mentioned shallow machine models, which
frequently results in unsatisﬁed model performance.
Deep learning, due to its advantages of superior nonlinear ﬁtting and data representa-
tion capabilities, has achieved a widespread application in the WTCM ﬁeld. There are deep
learning algorithms, which possess powerful spatial features mining capabilities such as
convolutional neural network (CNN) [ 24,25], restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) [ 26],
deep belief network (DBN) [ 27,28], denoising autoencoder (DAE) [ 29], and stacked denois-
ing autoencoder (SDAE) [ 30], as well as temporal algorithms, which are good at processing
time series, such as long short-term memory network (LSTM) [ 31], gated recurrent unit
network (GRU) [ 32], and attention mechanism (AM) [ 33]. The above-mentioned spatial
and temporal algorithms have been widely used in the condition monitoring and fault
diagnosis of wind turbine key components.
By comparing instantaneous monitoring parameters of four wind turbines with sig-
niﬁcant correlation and analyzing their gearbox bearing power-temperature distribution,
Guo et al. [ 24] employed a convolutional neural network to model historical health SCADA
data to realize rapid warnings of gearbox bearing over-temperature faults. Using 24 h
SCADA data prior to actual faults and employing Pearson correlation coefﬁcient to cal-
culate coupling levels among different condition parameters, Wang et al. [ 25] built a
correlation graph convolutional neural network to identify early fault signals for gener-
ator brush fault and pitch system drive fault. Based on a stacked restricted Boltzmann
machine, Yang et al. [ 26] established a normal behavior model using only health data
instead of labeled data, and realized an unsupervised anomaly detection approach for wind
turbine condition monitoring. To fulﬁll early detection of wind turbine gearbox sensor

faults, a multiscale spatio-temporal convolutional deep belief network was construed by
Wang et al. [ 27] to learn the spatio-temporal features inherent in SCADA data. By pre-
training and ﬁne-tuning the weights and biases parameters using BPNN, and setting model
hyper-parameters using an improved exponential change learning factor particle swarm
optimization, Zhang et al. [ 28] proposed an IPSO-DBN based condition monitoring method
to identify early anomalies of generator windings and bearings. Denoising autoencoder or
stacked denoising autoencoder, due to their powerful nonlinear characteristic mining capa-
bilities among multivariate variables, were employed by Jia et al. [ 29] and Zhang et al. [ 30]
to build generator normal behavior models to automatically identify generator bearing
early deteriorated conditions, respectively. To better capture temporal features inherent in
high-dimensional SCADA time series, Wu et al. [ 31] proposed a novel early faults detection
method, which incorporates long short-term memory network and the Kullback–Leibler
divergence statistical algorithm for generator windings and gearbox bearings. Li et al. [ 32]
used another improved variant of recurrent neural networks, a two-layer gated recurrent
unit network, to establish the blade breakage detection model using SCADA data that were
pre-processed by the Euclidian distance and feature simpliﬁcation random forest algorithm.
In order to further improve model performance, Xiao et al. [ 33] combined an attention
mechanism, which can optimize computational resource allocation and learn adaptive
weights for model inputs, with bidirectional long short-term memory network to construct
a dual-attention BiLSTM-based model for main bearing condition monitoring.
However, SCADA data are essentially multivariate time series that possess dual spatio-
temporal attributes. It is often difﬁcult to comprehensively consider the mining of inherent
spatio-temporal characteristics with the above-mentioned single spatial or temporal mod-
els. Consequently, composite models integrating spatial and temporal algorithms have
recently attracted people’s attention. More and more spatio-temporal composite models
integrating convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks in the parallel
or sequential ways have been widely utilized in the wind turbine condition monitoring
ﬁeld [ 34,35]. After using kernel principal component analysis to select monitoring variables
as model inputs, Zhu et al. [ 36] established a new generator windings anomaly detection
approach through employing convolutional neural networks cascaded with long short-
term memory networks. Based on spatio-temporal feature fusion of SCADA data, Kong
et al. [ 37] proposed a novel gearbox condition monitoring method, which ﬁrst mines spatial
features by convolutional neural networks, then learns temporal characteristics using gated
recurrent unit networks. To further optimize model performance, Xiang et al. [ 38] and
Zhan et al. [ 39] introduction attention mechanisms and bidirectional network structures
to construct normal behavior models to identify deterioration conditions for gearbox and
main bearings, respectively.
However, traditional composite models have certain limitations, which include issues
like non-interactive or non-synchronous problems in extracting spatio-temporal features
due to inherent defects in parallel or sequential structures. Therefore, there is still space for
improvement of their performance.
In summary, scholars have conducted numerous studies on condition monitoring
methods for wind turbine key components, considering various types of modeling data
and employing different model structures. However, there are still certain limitations that
need to be addressed.
(1) Existing condition monitoring approaches primarily incorporate attention mecha-
nisms in the following two ways: (a) Introducing the feature attention mechanism
on the model-input variables dimension to assign attention weights according to
the impact of different model input features on model output; (b) Introducing the
time attention mechanism on the time dimension to assign larger attention weights
to time steps that are highly correlated with the current prediction. However, these
approaches often lack consideration for a multi-dimensional attention fusion.
(2) The network structures of spatio-temporal models in the previous studies have inher-
ent disadvantages, speciﬁcally the issues of non-interactivity and non-synchronicity

when attempting to extract spatio-temporal features from SCADA time series data.
These limitations can have adverse effects on model performance.
Consequently, to tackle the above-mentioned issues, combining multi-dimensional
attention mechanisms, convolutional long short-term memory network, and a dynamic
adaptive threshold, a novel hybrid-attention spatio-temporal condition monitoring method
for a wind turbine gearbox was proposed in this study, with the following main contributions.
(1) This study proposed a multi-dimensional hybrid-attention mechanism (HA). By
introducing attention mechanisms into the spatial-dimension and temporal-dimension
of model input data matrices produced by the sliding window approach, multi-
dimensional attention weights can be calculated and assigned to input matrices
to increase key feature weights and weaken or discard redundant features. The
experimental results showed that the hybrid-attention mechanism can signiﬁcantly
improve the model performance.
(2) We constructed a novel HA-BiConvLSTM spatio-temporal normal behavior model
(NBM) for a wind turbine gearbox. Convolutional long short-term memory (Con-
vLSTM) perfectly integrates the powerful local spatial-feature extractive capability
of CNN and the efﬁcient time series processing capability of LSTM, the embedded
network structure of which compensates disadvantages of conventional parallel or
sequential structures (denoted as CNN-LSTM and CNN&LSTM) to some extent. Com-
pared with CNN-LSTM and CNN&LSTM, the constructed HA-BiConvLSTM model
achieved better valuation result in terms of RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and R2metrics.
(3) We designed an improved EWMA-based dynamic anomaly detection approach. Based
on the exponentially weighted moving-average algorithm (EWMA), the adaptive
outlier thresholds of prediction residuals of different well-trained gearbox NBMs can
be calculated to identify outliers. To reduce false alarms caused by some isolated
outliers, an anomaly detection index, i.e., the outlier ratio within a sliding window,
was proposed to improve the reliability of early gearbox faults. Results of the case
study illustrated that the proposed HA-BiConvLSTM-iEWMA (HBCE) method can
detect gearbox deteriorated conditions earlier than conventional CNN-LSTM and
CNN&LSTM models, which veriﬁed the effectiveness, superiority, and robustness of
the constructed HA-BiConvLSTM model.
The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 introduces the framework
of the proposed HA-BiConvLSTM-iEWMA (HBCE) spatio-temporal condition monitoring
method for wind turbine gearbox. Section 3 introduces the methodologies and structures
of the constructed HA-BiConvLSTM gearbox normal behavior model. Section 4 introduces
an improved EWMA-based dynamic anomaly detection approach. The proposed HBCE
method is validated using actual gearbox oil over-temperature fault collected from a wind
farm located in north China in Section 5, followed by brief conclusions in Section 6.
2. Framework of the Proposed HBCE Method
The framework of the proposed HA-BiConvLSTM-iEWMA (HBCE) condition moni-
toring method is depicted in Figure 1, which mainly contains two phrases: ofﬂine training
and online monitoring.
Phase 1. Ofﬂine training.
Step 1. Data preprocessing. In order to eliminate outliers caused by turbulent wind,
power curtailment, and sensor failure, the modiﬁed Thompson tau approach was used
for the data cleaning of the original historical SCADA data to acquire a health modeling
dataset. Additionally, data normalization needs to be implemented to reduce the difﬁculty
of model training and shorten training time.
Step 2. Variable selection. Generally, when there are no limitations on computational
resources and model complexity, the more input variables there are, the more likely it
is to obtain a model with higher performance. However, to balance model complexity
with model performance, a compound correlation analysis approach consisting of Pearson,

Spearman, Kendall correlation coefﬁcients was employed to select model input variables
that have high correlation with model output.
Step 3. Data matrices for modeling. Sliding window approach was employed to
process the selected model input variables to acquire modeling data matrices D, which
were further split into train set D train and test set D testfor model training and test.
Step 4. HA-BiConvLSTM model training and test. Based on train set Dtrain and test
setDtestobtained in Step 3, the constructed HA-BiConvLSTM model in this study can be
trained and tested to learn the behavior modes of a wind turbine gearbox when operating
under health conditions.
Phase 2. Online monitoring.
Step 5. Predictions and prediction residuals of HA-BiConvLSTM. Based on the online
SCADA data and the well-trained HA-BiConvLSTM model, real-time predictions of wind
turbine gearbox temperature can be generated, and prediction residuals between the
predictions and measurements can be calculated.
Step 6. Condition monitoring and fault alarm. To reduce false alarm caused by some
isolated outlier, the exponentially weighted moving-average algorithm was used to smooth
residual sequence and calculate the upper limit of the control chart UCL as adaptive outlier
threshold to identify anomaly conditions. Then, the outlier ratio was computed within a
sliding window as an anomaly detection index to determine whether to issue early fault
alarm signals.

3.1. Data Preprocessing
3.1.1. Data Cleaning
Generally, the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system has been
widely deployed in modern large-scale wind turbines regardless of online or ofﬂine wind
farms, which can record and store massive high-dimensional and multi-source heteroge-
neous operation data of wind turbine key components, as well as environmental infor-
mation around wind turbines. However, original historical SCADA data often contain
outliers caused by turbulent wind, power curtailment, and sensor failure, which need to be
eliminated to achieve health SCADA data for modeling.
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

In this study, the modiﬁed Thompson tau approach, which is a statistical method for
deciding whether to keep or discard suspected outliers in a sample of a single variable,
was employed for data cleaning using wind speed and active power of wind turbines. As
for the wind speed and active power data, ﬁrst divide the wind speed range into 0.5 m/s
contiguous bins centered on multiples of 0.5 m/s, and then group the active power data
into wind speed intervals (i.e., bins).
Mathematically , for the increasing ordered active power dataset Pi=fpi, 1,pi, 2, . . . , pi,ng
of the ith wind speed bin, where i=1, 2, . . .,m,pi, 1pi, 1  pi,n,mrepresents
the number of wind speed bins, nstands for the number of active power samples in each
wind speed bin, the mean piand standard deviation SiofPican be calculated according to
Equations (1) and (2).

Then, for an active power sample pi,j, the absolute error di,jcan be calculated through
Equation (3).
di,j=pi,j pi (3)
Generally, the larger the absolute error di,j, the more likely active power sample pi,jis
to be a suspected outlier. Typically, either the ﬁrst or last active power samples are most
suspected, since they are the lowest and highest values of Pi, respectively.
Furthermore, the value of the modiﬁed Thompson tau t, which is a function of the
number of active power samples (i.e., n), can be calculated by Equation (4).

where ta/2is the critical student’s t value, arefers to signiﬁcance level and is set as a=0.01
in this study.
The outlier detection strategy is as follows:
Ifdi,j>tSi, remove the active power sample. It is an outlier.
Ifdi,jtSi, keep the active power sample. It is not an outlier.
One suspected outlier is detected and eliminated at each time, and the mean piand
standard deviation SiofPiwill be recalculated. The process will be repeated until no more
outliers are detected.
3.1.2. Data Normalization
SCADA data have multi-source heterogeneous characteristics and the values of dif-
ferent monitoring variables vary in size. To eliminate the impact of different variables’
dimensions on model training and to reduce the difﬁculty of model training, it is neces-
sary to carry out data normalization to scale down the data range to [0, 1] according to
Equation (5).

where xis the original data, x0is the normalized data, xminandxmaxare the minimum and

condition parameters of wind turbine key components and environmental information
around wind turbines. To reduce the complexity of the model and to improve the training

efﬁciency, a hybrid correlation analysis approach was employed to select monitoring
variables, which have high correlation with model output, as model inputs.
The hybrid correlation analysis designed in this study consists of three correlation
coefﬁcients, i.e., Pearson correlation coefﬁcient Rp, Spearman correlation coefﬁcient Rs, and
Kendall correlation coefﬁcient Rk, which can be calculated according to Equations (6)–(8),
respectively.

two variables in ranks of the “ ith” elements, rank () represents an order function, sign ()
represents a sign function.
Statistically, the absolute values of different correlation coefﬁcients can quantitatively
measure the correlation between variables, | R| < 0.3 indicates a weak correlation between
variables; 0.3 < | R| < 0.7 indicates a moderate correlation between variables; and | R| > 0.7
indicates a strong correlation between variables. In this study, we directly chose 0.3 as the
correlation threshold, based on which we carried out the variable selection procedure.
3.1.4. Model Input Matrices Based on the Sliding Window Algorithm
Additionally, prior to model training, the sliding window algorithm was employed
to process the health modeling dataset obtained after data preprocessing and variable
selection to acquire model input data matrices X1,X2,X3,. . .,Xn,. . .within windows.
The brief data processing process of sliding window is displayed in Figure 2, and the nth

Temporal Hybrid Attention Mechanis
m
 
Attention mechanisms originate from the study of human vision. The earliest appli-
cation of attention mechanism in deep learning is Bahdanau attention proposed by Bah-
danau et al. 
[40]
, which is used to solve the alignment problem of source languages with 
different lengths in machine translation. At present, attention mechanisms are widely 
used in natural language processing, speech recognition, and other aspects. As a resource 
allocati
on strategy, attention mechanisms can adaptively allocate attention weights to in-
put information, enhance the model
’
s attention to key features, weaken or even discard 
redundant features, and ultimately achieve the goal of improving model performance. In 
t
his study, a hybrid attention mechanism consisting of feature attention and time attention 
was designed to allocate attention weights to model input matrices.

3.3. Bidirectional Conventional Long Short-Term Memory Network
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a family of neural networks with short-term
memory capability, which are good at processing time series data. The neurons of recurrent
neural networks can not only receive information from other neurons, but also from
themselves, forming a network structure with loops. Recurrent neural networks have
been widely used in speech recognition, language model, natural language generation
and other tasks. The parameter learning of recurrent neural network can be learned
according to the back-propagation through time (BPTT) algorithm [ 41], which can transfer
the error information backward step by step in the reverse order of time. However, for
the conventional recurrent neural network (RNN), when the input sequence is relatively
long, there will be gradient explosion or gradient vanishing problems [ 42], also known as
long-range dependence problems. In order to solve those problems, people have made
many improvements to the conventional recurrent neural network, among which the most
effective way is to introduce a gating mechanism.
3.3.1. ConvLSTM
Conventional long short-term memory network (ConvLSTM), proposed by Shi et al. [ 43]
in 2015 for precipitation nowcasting, is an improved variant of the fully connected long
short-term memory (FC-LSTM). Fully connected long short-term memory (FC-LSTM) is a
variant of RNN, which takes one-dimensional sequential feature vectors as model input
and calculates both the input-to-state and state-to-input transactions in the fully connected
manner [ 44]. By replacing the fully connected operators with the convolution operators in
the input-to-state and state-to-input transactions, the ConvLSTM network can possess the
mining capabilities of local spatial features while learning the temporal feature hidden in
model inputs. Additionally, different from traditional spatio-temporal models (i.e., CNN-
LSTM and CNN&LSTM), which achieve both the spatial features and temporal features
extraction capabilities by simply combining CNN and LSTM in sequential or parallel ways,
the ConvLSTM network integrates CNN and LSTM in an embedded manner and has better
spatiotemporal interaction and synchronization. The structure of the conventional long
short-term memory unit is displayed in Figure 5.
As can be seen from Figure 5, compared with the conventional FC-LSTM unit, the
improvements of ConvLSTM unit are to replace the fully connected operations by the
convolutional operations (i.e., the blue lines of the structure of the ConvLSTM unit), which
make it additionally possess the powerful capabilities of mining the spatial feature hidden
in the input data matrices, except for effectively handling the temporal correlations.
The introduction of the gate mechanisms can make the convolutional long short-term
networks (ConvLSTM) effectively address the problems of gradient disappearance or
gradient explosion existed in the traditional deep recurrent neural networks. As can be
seen from Figure 5, three gates—a forget gate that determines the information ratio that
the memory cell Ct 1needs to discard, an input gate that determines the information ratio

that the candidate memory cell
Ctneed to reserve, and an output gate that determines the
information ratio that the memory cell Ctneed to pass to the hidden state Ht.
The input gate It, forget gate Ft, memory cell Ct, output gate Ot, and hidden state Ht
can be calculated according to Equations (21)–(25).

3.3.2. BiConvLSTM
The bidirectional conventional long short-term memory network (BiConvLSTM) is
composed of two ConvLSTM networks with identical structures and opposite propaga-
tion directions, namely, the forward layer and the backward layer. The structure of the
BiConvLSTM network is displayed in Figure 6. Compared with ConvLSTM, BiConvLSTM
inherits its many advantages and can also capture sequence information in both positive
and negative directions.

composed of two ConvLSTM
 
networks with identical structure

and opposite propaga-
tion directions, namely, the forward layer and the backward layer. The structure of the 
BiConvLSTM network is displayed in Figure 6. Compared with ConvLSTM, BiConvLSTM 
inherits its many advantages and can also capture sequence informat

4. Condition Monitoring
Based on the historical health SCADA data, the constructed HA-BiConvLSTM nor-
mal behavior model (NBM) for a wind turbine gearbox can be trained and tested. The
well-trained HA-BiConvLSTM model can be further employed to carry out condition mon-
itoring to identify early anomalies through online SCADA data. Generally, the predicted
residuals between the real measurements and the predictions of NBMs are small with
stable ﬂuctuations around zero when the wind turbine operates under health conditions.
However, once the wind turbine gearbox suffers from condition deterioration, the predicted
residuals will slowly increase and ﬂuctuate violently. Therefore, whether the operating
conditions of the gearbox is normal or abnormal can be determined by real-time monitoring
of the change trend of residuals, and further statistical analysis for the ratio of outliers can
be used to judge whether to trigger the early fault alarms.
In this study, an improved exponentially weighted moving-average algorithm (iEWMA)
based anomaly detection approach was designed for gearbox condition monitoring. Specifi-
cally, based on EWMA algorithm, the adaptive outlier threshold of prediction residuals is
firstly calculated to identify outliers, then a further statistical analysis of the outlier ratio
within a sliding window is conducted to reduce false alarms caused by some isolated outliers.
According to the original predicted residual rtas shown by Equation (34), the EWMA-
smoothed residual etcan be calculated by Equation (35).
rt=yt ˆyt (34)

where yt,ˆytare the measurements and predictions, respectively, l2(0, 1]represents the
smoothing coefﬁcient. The larger the smoothing coefﬁcient l, the greater the weight of the
current sample rt. In this study, we set l=0.2.
Then, the mean metand standard deviation setof the EWMA-smoothed residual etcan
be calculated by Equations (36) and (37), respectively.

when residual exceeding UCL(t)) of the wind turbine gearbox.

than 0.3 (i.e., active power, actual torque, blade 1 motor temperature, current L1, gearbox
front bearing temperature, gearbox inlet oil temperature, gearbox oil pump pressure,
gearbox rear bearing temperature, generator speed, generator winding U temperature,
main bearing temperature, main bearing speed, wind speed) as the model inputs, gearbox
oil temperature as the model output. It should be noted that for variables like currents
(L1, L2, L3) and generator winding temperature (U, V , W), we only chose one phase as
the model input. Detailed calculation results of three correlation coefﬁcients are shown

overcome the disadvantages of the non-interactive problem caused by the CNN&LSTM
parallel network structure, or the non-synchronous problem caused by the CNN-LSTM
cascaded network structure, which means that it can effectively mine the spatial-temporal
features inherent in the massive high-dimensional SCADA time series.
Among all four comparative models, the constructed HA-BiConvLSTM model pos-
sessed the best prediction performance, due to the bidirectional network structure that can
capture the sequential information from both forward and backward directions simultane-
ously, and the hybrid-attention introduction that can adaptively assign attention weights
to input variables to enhance the model’s focus on key features or weaken the redundant
features. The RMSE, MAE, and MAPE values of the HA-BiConvLSTM networks were
0.7683C, 0.5696C, and 0.0098, which were 21.27%, 23.75%, and 23.97% lower than those
of the ConvLSTM network, respectively. The R2value of the HA-BiConvLSTM network
was 0.9918, which was 1.06% higher than that of the ConvLSTM network.

ent models for test set B, the probability density distributions (PDF) of prediction residuals

Figure 12. Gearbox oil temperature predictions of different models for partial test set B.
As can be seen from Figures 10–12, compared with CNN-LSTM and CNN&LSTM, the
prediction results clearly illustrated the ConvLSTM’s advantages of smaller residual values,
less residual outliers, more stable residual ﬂuctuations, sharper probability density function
(PDF) curve, and predictions closer to the real measurements, which verify the superiority
of the network structure of ConvLSTM as a gearbox normal behavior model. It can be also
found that the introduction of hybrid-attention and bidirectional-structure improved the
model performance of ConvLSTM, and the constructed HA-BiConvLSTM model of this
study performed best in all aspects (i.e., smallest residual values, sharpest PDF curve, and
closest to the real measurements), which was consistent with the quantitative evaluation
results in terms of RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and R2values, as listed in Table 3.
Overall, from both a quantitative metric and qualitative display perspective, the above-
mentioned results listed in Table 3 and displayed in Figures 10–12 veriﬁed the effectiveness
and superiority of the constructed HA-BiConvLSTM model due to its powerful spatio-
temporal feature mining ability, as a normal behavior model for a gearbox.
5.5. Condition Monitoring
When model ofﬂine training is completed, the well-trained HA-BiConvLSTM normal
behavior model can be employed to implement online condition monitoring for a wind
turbine gearbox. Generally, when a wind turbine operates normally, the NBMs prediction
residuals would be small with stable ﬂuctuations. Nevertheless, when a wind turbine
gearbox suffers from condition deteriorations, the NBMs prediction residuals would be
larger with violent ﬂuctuations. Therefore, by real-time monitoring the change trend of the
NBMs prediction residuals and residual statistical analysis using sliding windows, early
faults of wind turbine gearboxes can be identiﬁed automatically in advance.
An actual gearbox fault case collected from a wind farm located in north China was
used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed HBCE method for early fault detection.

Meanwhile, to verify the superiority of the proposed HBCE method, conventional spatio-
temporal models (i.e., CNN-LSTM, CNN&LSTM) were employed to compare and analyze
the early fault detection results with the constructed HA-BiConvLSTM model. According
to the alarm records of the SCADA system and the operation and maintenance logs of
wind farm, WT #17 experienced a gearbox oil over-temperature fault on 5 July 2023 at
9:00. Approximate one month SCADA data around 5 July 2023 9:00 were selected for the
validation analysis of the model’s early anomaly capability.
Figure 13 displays the wind speed and active power of WT #17, from which it can be
found that the wind speed ﬂuctuated violently between 5.4 m/s and 11.69 m/s during the
period from 24 June 2023 15:40 to 27 June 2023 20:00, and gradually climbed from 3.31 m/s
to the maximum 13.12 m/s during the period from 2 July 2023 23:40 to 5 July 2023 9:00.

Figure 14. Different NBMs’ predictions and real meas urements of WT #17 gearbox oil tempera-
ture. 
As can be observed in Figure 14, at beginning of the period, different NBMs’ predic-
tions are very close to real measurements and consistent with the variation trend of real 
gearbox oil temperature. However, from around  24 June 2023, prediction residuals that 
indicate differences between predictions and measurements start to increase little by little 
with bigger fluctuations, and the consistencies of predictions and measurements also 
gradually deteriorate until the real gearbox oi l temperature exceeds 80 °C on 5 July 2023 
at 9:00. 
Then, different NBMs’ prediction residual s can be calculated by predictions and 
measurements and smoothed by the exponentially weighted moving-average (EWMA) 
method, which can be further employed to calculate adaptive outlier thresholds by Equa-
tion (38). Then, through statistical analysis of outliers using sliding windows, early fault 
alarm can be triggered if the number of out liers in the window exceeds 6 (i.e., gearbox 
abnormal condition lasting for more than one hour). In this study, we set the window 
range as 6 and an alarm signal will be issued if the outlier ratio reaches 1. 
For the fault dataset acquired from WT #1 7, which experienced a gearbox oil over-
temperature fault, the original prediction re siduals, smoothed residuals, adaptive thresh-
olds, and outlier sliding window statistical results of three contrastive NBMs (i.e., the con-

Figure 15 displays the condition monitoring results of the traditional CNN-LSTM
model for WT #17.
As can be observed from Figure 15, during approximately the ﬁrst half of the study
period, the CNN-LSTM prediction residuals, including the original residual and the EWMA
smoothed residual, were small with stable ﬂuctuations; most residuals were under the
adaptive outlier threshold UCL = 2.83C except for two isolated outliers on 12 June 2023

at 3:20 and 20 June 2023 at 4:30. However, from around 24 June 2023, prediction residuals
started to gradually increase and ﬂuctuate violently in amplitude until continuously ex-
ceeding the outlier threshold UCL = 2.83C around 29 June 2023 21:10, and the outlier ratio
within a sliding window continuously reached the maximum 1 after 29 June 2023 21:10,
which indicates that the CNN-LSTM model can identiﬁed the early fault signal 131.83 h in
advance of the actual failure time 2023/7/5 9:00.
Figure 16 displays the condition monitoring results of the traditional CNN&LSTM
model for WT #17.
As can be observed from Figure 16, the condition monitoring results of CNN&LSTM
for WT #17 were similar to CNN-LSTM during approximately the ﬁrst half of the study
period, and most residuals were under the adaptive outlier threshold UCL = 2.62C, except
for an isolated outlier on 18 June 2023 at 9:50. Moreover, within the second half-period,
prediction residuals started to gradually increase and ﬂuctuate violently in amplitude until
continuously exceeding the outlier threshold UCL = 2.82C around 26 June 2023 5:30, and
the outlier ratio within a sliding window continuously reached the maximum 1 after 26
June 2023 5:30, which indicates that the CNN&LSTM model can identiﬁed the early fault
signal 219.5 h in advance of the actual failure time 5 July 2023 9:00.
Figure 17 displays the condition monitoring results of the constructed HA-BiConvLSTM
model for WT #17.
As can be observed from Figure 17, different from the conventional CNN-LSTM and
CNN&LSTM models, the prediction residuals of the constructed HA-BiConvLSTM model
in this study did not include isolated outliers when the wind turbine gearbox operated
under health conditions during approximately the ﬁrst half-period, which illustrates the ro-
bustness of HA-BiConvLSTM. All residuals were below the outlier threshold UCL = 2.48C
until continuously exceeding it around 24 June 2023 19:50, and the outlier ratio within
a sliding window continuously reached the maximum 1 after 24 June 2023 19:50, which
indicates that the HA-BiConvLSTM model can identify the early fault signal 253.17 h in
advance of the actual failure time 5 July 2023 9:00.
In summary, through contrastively analyzing the condition monitoring results of
different NBMs for fault wind turbine WT #17, the effectiveness, superiority, and robustness
of the HA-BiConvLSTM model for wind turbine gearbox early fault detection were veriﬁed.
6. Conclusions
In this study, based on the hybrid attention mechanism (HA), the convolutional long
short-term memory network (BiConvLSTM), and the improved exponentially weighted
moving-average algorithm (iEWMA) based anomaly detection approach, we proposed a
novel spatio-temporal condition monitoring method (HBCE) for a wind turbine gearbox.
The effectiveness, superiority, and robustness of the proposed HBCE method was veriﬁed
by the SCADA datasets collected from a wind farm in north China, and further compared
with two conventional spatio-temporal models (i.e., CNN-LSTM and CNN&LSTM). The
following conclusions can be drawn from the comparative experimental results.
(1) The ConvLSTM model efﬁciently integrates CNN and LSTM through an embedded
network structure, and overcomes the non-interactive or non-synchronous problems
of conventional models when extracting spatio-temporal features. Compared with
CNN-LSTM and CNN&LSTM, the ConvLSTM model presented better performance
with lower RMSE, MAE, and MAPE values and a higher R2value.
(2) The introduced hybrid attention mechanism can signiﬁcantly enhance the model
performance by calculating and assigning different attention weights from the spatio-
temporal dimension for model input features. The constructed HA-BiConvLSTM
model achieved the RMSE, MAE, and MAPE reductions by about 21.27%, 23.75%, and
23.97%, and the R2improvement by 1.06%, in comparison with the ConvLSTM model.
(3) The proposed HBCE method has superior and robust early fault warning capabilities,
which can efﬁciently identify early deteriorated conditions of a wind turbine gearbox

253.17 h in advance of the actual failure time, and 121.34 h, 33.67 h earlier than
CNN-LSTM and CNN&LSTM.
In the future study, we will attempt to apply the proposed HBCE method to other
different components (e.g., blade motor, main bearings, or generator) of wind turbines of
the same or different type, to expand its application and evaluate its generalization.
