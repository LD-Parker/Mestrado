Abstract: Quantifying wind turbine (WT) gearbox fatigue life is a critical problem for preventive
maintenance when unsolved. This paper proposes a practical approach that uses ten minutes’ average
wind speed of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data to quantify a WT gearbox’s
gear fatigue life. Wind turbulence impacts on gearbox fatigue are studied thoroughly. Short-term
fatigue assessment for the gearbox is then performed using linear fatigue theory by considering WT
responses under external and internal excitation. The results shows that for a three stage gearbox,
the sun gear in the ﬁrst stage and pinions in the 2nd and 3rd stage are the most vulnerable parts.
High mean wind speed, especially above the rated range, leads to a high risk of gearbox fatigue
damage. Increase of wind turbulence may not increase fatigue damage as long as a WT has an
instant response to external excitation. An approach of using SCADA data recorded every ten
minutes to quantify gearbox long-term damages is presented. The calculation results show that the
approach effectively presents gears’ performance degradation by quantifying their fatigue damage.
This is critical to improve WT reliability and meaningful for WT gearbox fatigue assessment theory.
The result provides useful tools for future wind farm prognostic maintenance.

1. Introduction
The gearbox is an important mechanical component in a wind turbine (WT). Its availability and
reliability attract attention due to the ultimate long downtime if it fails. The difﬁcult accessibility of
offshore wind farms further brings challenges to gearbox maintenance which requires an advanced
operational and maintenance strategy for WTs [ 1,2]. Properly scheduled corrective and preventive
maintenance both require effective WT fault detection, precise fault diagnosis and accurate prognosis
techniques. To achieve efﬁcient wind farm maintenance and competitive wind life-cycle cost, structural
health monitoring techniques of WT system are being quickly developed through intelligent condition
monitoring technique that integrates on-line fault detection and prognosis [ 3]. A model-based approach
has been developed for WT gearbox fault detection [ 4]. Suitable methods and approaches are crucial
for WT damage detection and fatigue accumulation estimation. Related technologies such as machine
fatigue damage prognosis would greatly increase the value of condition monitoring in the drive train
of WTs [ 5]. Different techniques have been developed for WT gearbox prognosis, which include using
angular velocity measurements for bearing failure [ 6], hidden Markov models, neural networks and
particle ﬁlter methods [7].

Currently, most WT gearbox designs are based on the ISO-6336 series [ 8] or IEC 61400 [ 9] in order
to satisfy the minimum safety factors during the design stage. The question arises as to how to quantify
WTs’ long-term fatigue life when they are operating under variable and turbulent wind conditions.
In the standards only the short-term WT gearbox fatigue is considered [ 10]. Models and approaches
to calculate WT gearbox long-term fatigue damage are developed based on linear fatigue theory
and wind speed statistical distribution [ 10,11]. The most vulnerable components of the WT gearbox
are compared and summarized to assist reliability-based maintenance [ 12]. The main reason for the
randomness of fatigue damage lies in the characteristics of the material, the geometric dimensions
of the test pieces, and the uncertainty of external loads [ 13]. Internal excitation can be considered by
a detailed rigid and ﬂexible multi-body model of a WT drive train which is normally used to study
the internal dynamics of the mechanical transmission system [ 14–16]. However, external excitation of
the gearbox coming from short-term scale rapid wind speed variation which is essentially correlated
to wind turbulence effects attracts little research attention [ 17]. Irregular stress amplitudes of WT
gearboxes due to WTs’ response to both external and internal excitation causes further complexity
and difﬁculty for predicting gear damage and fatigue life. In addition, cost-effective gearbox damage
quantiﬁcation relies on a realistic measurement or implementation solution to enable the calculation.
Fatigue, wear or plastic deformation are common gearbox failure modes, of which the most
common cause of gear failure is tooth bending fatigue [ 18]. Contact fatigue failure (pitting) and
bending fatigue failure (tooth breakage) could be two of the main gear failure reasons [ 19]. Bending
fatigue failure is a common failure mode in engineering and it happens when variable loads appear
act a gear which leads to fatigue stress [ 20]. This paper is limited on studying bending stress fatigue
analysis rather than micropitting and pitting fatigue life, that is bending stress is taken into account for
gear fatigue life prediction without considering assembly errors and geometry defects.
This paper is focused on the mechanism of a gearbox’s gear bending fatigue failure to develop a
method to predict the fatigue life with practical supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
data. A dynamic model of the planetary gear system and a wind speed model that considers wind
turbulence impacts is used. Time domain short-term WT gear meshing forces under different wind
turbulence scales are obtained by a simulation model, which couples the WT model and the gearbox
dynamic model. Load cycle distribution is then assessed for fatigue damage prediction based on linear
fatigue damage theory. According to the low sampling rate characteristics of SCADA data, a practical
approach is then proposed to quantify long-term gearbox gear fatigue damage, which is derived from
the theoretical calculations and analysis results.
2. SCADA Data for Long Term Fatigue Quantiﬁcation
The approach proposed in this paper to quantify WT gearbox is illustrated in Figure 1. Firstly,
short-term gearbox damage under stochastic wind speed conditions is investigated by the calculation
procedure shown in the left column in Figure 1. The short-term wind speed variation is characterized
by the mean wind speed with different turbulence scale that represents the external excitation in
the gearbox dynamics. The torque generated by the WT rotor is simulated by a ﬂuid aerodynamic
model, which is used as input of the drive train dynamic model. Internal excitation of WT gearbox is
considered by taking varying meshing stiffness into account in calculating the time domain bending
stress amplitudes. Stress cycles are counted by a rain-ﬂow counting algorithm. As only the stress
variation amplitudes are considered during cycle counting, Goodman corrections are adopted to
account for the stress level inﬂuence. Finally, short-term fatigue damage of gears is obtained according
to linear fatigue theory.
Secondly, a procedure of using SCADA data to quantify long-term damage of gearbox is presented.
The WT SCADA data recorded ten minute average wind speeds and also the maximum and minimum
values during this period. Accordingly wind turbulence scales within those ten minutes are calculated
based on a mathematical derivation by assuming that the wind speed distribution is in accordance
with statistics. This mathematical model is presented in Section 6. Corresponding short-term damage

 Corresponding short-term damage quantification results are obtained, in terms of wind speed 
parameters, and then further accumulate d for long-term damage quantification. 
Finally, a real case of using SCADA data to quantify gearbox damage is presented for a realistic 
WT that had suffered a catastrophic gear failure. It provides a cost-effective solution for gearbox 
damage quantification and performance monitoring from a practical point of view.

3.1. Wind Speed Simulation 
In this paper, the external environment that a WT is subjected to refers to wind conditions only, 
which effects on WT loading are calculated. Short-term wind speed is characterized by the mean wind speed v
m and the turbulence-induced wind variation v t during the statistical period, which can 
be expressed as:

According to the WT cut-in and cut-out wind sp eed range, mean wind speeds from 4 to 25 m/s 
are considered [21]. A wind speed model that co nsiders turbulence grades of A, B and C is 
constructed for a ten minutes period [17]. An improved Von Karman wind speed power spectrum 
model [22] is used to build the turbulence wind which takes air flow field into consideration for a thickness of the atmospheric boundary layer not exceeding 150 m. Accordingly, the longitudinal 
component of the auto-power spectral density function  is shown in Equation (2 ). Equation (3) is the

Combining the three parts of the gearbox dynamics model, the load spectrum of a single gear

WT gears are subjected to irregular stress which is due to its unique external condition of random
and turbulentwind. This is an irregular random process, in which the magnitude of the random
variable loads, fatigue damage estimation and service life time prediction are complex. Fatigue

damage estimation of gears is performed by tooth root bending stress cycle counting, which essentially
assumes that failure mechanism of a gear is a cumulative process. Normally this is calculated by
Palmgren-Miner’s linear damage rule [31].
The rain-ﬂow (RF) cycle method [ 32] assumes that the plasticity of materials results in fatigue
damage which can be reﬂected on the stress-strain hysteresis loop. The rain-ﬂow cycle algorithm
records the amplitude and means value of the stress, so that it obtains all the information of the stress
cycle of the material. A full RF cycle [ 33] was deﬁned as a stress range formed by two points which are
bounded within adjacent points of higher and lower magnitude.
The Palmgren-Miner theory is based on two assumptions: (1) the materials’ fatigue damages
under different stress levels are independent of each other; (2) the materials fatigue damage can be
linearly accumulative. Damage is calculated with Equation (15):
m

1ni
Ni=n1
N1+n2
N2+n3
N3+n4
N4+. . .+nm
Nm=D (15)
Stress cycle are counted by the rain-ﬂow cycle method and its amplitude should be normalized to
a zero-mean stress level before applying the Palmgren-Miner theory. When the critical value D of linear
cumulative fatigue damage approaches 1, the theory predicts the material is broken. In this process, as
only the cycles with the same stress variation amplitude are counted for the full cycles, the inﬂuences
of mean stress values actually are not reﬂected in the rain ﬂow counting process. To consider the
mean stress value effects, a Goodman linear equation is used to calculate equivalent loads as shown in
Equation (16) [34]:
ea=ba
b m(16)
whereeais the zero-mean equivalent stress level; bis stress limit of material; ais the amplitude of
stress;mis the mean stress. Using Goodman equation asymmetric stress levels are transformed into
symmetric stress (zero-mean) levels.

rotor diameter of 79.2 m, air density of 1.225 kg/m3, the tip speed ratio of 6.3, wind energy utilization
coefﬁcient of 0.32. The WT conﬁguration parameters are listed in Table 1 and the gearbox geometry
parameters are listed in Table 2. The calculation is for a WT which has failed during operation due to
broken teeth observed in the planetary stage gears.

For demonstration purposes, the time domain wind speed variation with a mean wind speed of

Normalized wind speed statistical distributions for different mean wind speeds at different turbulence
scales of 10%, 20% and 30% are plotted in Figure 5. It shows that with the increase of the wind
turbulence intensity the 10 min wind speed statistical distribution covers a wider range, which
essentially presents a wider range of wind speed variation.

With 10% wind turbulence scale, the WT aerodyna mic torques of the main shaft in response to 
different external wind conditions are shown in Figu re 6a,b. Figure 6a shows the torque variation of 
the WT main shaft under wind speeds from 4 to 10 m/s (under the rated wind speed range). The 
torques’ magnitudes increase with the increase of mean wind speed under this situation. Figure 6b 
shows its variation under wind speeds from 10 to 22 m/s (above the rated wind speed range). When 
the wind speed is below the rated range, the WT controls the rotational speed to maintain maximum output power. When the wind speed is ab ove the rated range, the WT controls the blade 
pitch angle to maintain constant output power. Th erefore, when the wind speed is above the rated 
range as shown in Figure 6a,b, the torques’ magnit udes are maintained due to the constant output 
power and rotational speed under the WT’s constant speed control mode. However, there are sudden drops of torque magnitudes for the high mean wind speed condition which is when the wind speed is above the cut-out range, as shown in  Figure 6c,d. Under this situation, the WT stops 
operating. Figure 7 shows the statis tical result of the main shaft to rque for varying mean wind speed 
and wind turbulence intensity. It shows that when  the mean wind speed is below the rated range the 
main shaft torque values increase with the increa se of mean wind speed. When the wind turbulence 
intensity increases the main shaft torques’ variation magnitudes increase, while when the mean wind speed is above the rated range, the main shaft torques remain constant.

With 10% wind turbulence scale, the WT aerodynamic torques of the main shaft in response to
different external wind conditions are shown in Figure 6a,b. Figure 6a shows the torque variation of
the WT main shaft under wind speeds from 4 to 10 m/s (under the rated wind speed range). The
torques’ magnitudes increase with the increase of mean wind speed under this situation. Figure 6b
shows its variation under wind speeds from 10 to 22 m/s (above the rated wind speed range). When
the wind speed is below the rated range, the WT controls the rotational speed to maintain maximum
output power. When the wind speed is above the rated range, the WT controls the blade pitch angle
to maintain constant output power. Therefore, when the wind speed is above the rated range as
shown in Figure 6a,b, the torques’ magnitudes are maintained due to the constant output power and
rotational speed under the WT’s constant speed control mode. However, there are sudden drops of
torque magnitudes for the high mean wind speed condition which is when the wind speed is above
the cut-out range, as shown in Figure 6c,d. Under this situation, the WT stops operating. Figure 7
shows the statistical result of the main shaft torque for varying mean wind speed and wind turbulence
intensity. It shows that when the mean wind speed is below the rated range the main shaft torque
values increase with the increase of mean wind speed. When the wind turbulence intensity increases
the main shaft torques’ variation magnitudes increase, while when the mean wind speed is above the
rated range, the main shaft torques remain constant.
The meshing force and bending stress between the planetary gear and sun gear calculated by the
multi-body dynamics model of the gearbox are shown in Figure 8. The results of two cases are shown
individually for wind speeds below and above the rated range. It shows that due to the gear meshing
process, the meshing force exhibits obvious periodical features. The mean meshing force increases
when the wind speed is below the rated range while it remains constant when the wind speed is above
the rated range. The variation amplitude of meshing forces are higher for wind speeds above the rated
range compared to the case where the wind speed is below the rated range. Its statistical results, as
shown in Figure 9, indicate that with the increases of turbulence intensities the meshing force variation
covers a wider range at the below rated wind speed range while they exhibit a similar distribution at
above the rated wind speed range. The negative meshing forces observed in Figures 8 and 9 are due to
the force direction variation.

turbulence scale: ( a) Iu = 10%; ( b) Iu = 20%; and ( c) Iu = 30%.  
The sun gear damage is larger than that of the other parts, which is due to its large torque as a 
result of the low rotational speed compared to th e gears at High Speed Intermidiate Stage (HSIS) 
and High Speed Stage (HSS). Therefore the force in the planetary stage is larger than in the other 
parts. There are also three contact points in a sun gear (contacts with the three planetary gears), 
therefore it has a higher damage risk than the planetary gears. To further investigate sun gear 
fatigue damage variation tendency under differe nt external environments, Figure 14 shows the 
calculation result for a sun gear when the mean wind speeds range from 4 m/s to 25 m/s and with 
turbulences changing from 10% to 30%. It is obse rved that when the mean wind speed is above 13 
m/s, the fatigue damage increases quickly compar ed to the case of wind speed below the rated

Figure 13. Fatigue damage of different gears under different mean wind speeds and the same
turbulence scale: ( a) Iu = 10%; ( b) Iu = 20%; and ( c) Iu = 30%.
The sun gear damage is larger than that of the other parts, which is due to its large torque as a
result of the low rotational speed compared to the gears at High Speed Intermidiate Stage (HSIS) and
High Speed Stage (HSS). Therefore the force in the planetary stage is larger than in the other parts.
There are also three contact points in a sun gear (contacts with the three planetary gears), therefore it
has a higher damage risk than the planetary gears. To further investigate sun gear fatigue damage
variation tendency under different external environments, Figure 14 shows the calculation result for a
sun gear when the mean wind speeds range from 4 m/s to 25 m/s and with turbulences changing
from 10% to 30%. It is observed that when the mean wind speed is above 13 m/s, the fatigue damage
increases quickly compared to the case of wind speed below the rated range. The magnitude of the
fatigue damage is maintained for wind speeds above 13 m/s. and the damage starts to decrease when
the mean wind speed is approaching 25 m/s. The damage variation tendencies for different turbulent
scales are observed to be similar.

Figure 14.  Fatigue damage of a sun gear. 
From Figure 14, it is also observed that dama ges to the sun gear due to wind speeds with 30% 
turbulence intensity are lower compared to the ca ses with 10% and 20% turbulence intensity. The 
reason for this can be explained by Figures 11 and 12. Wind turbulences of 10% or 20% at wind 
speeds above the rated range cause a high probabilit y of large mean bending stress and also large 
bending stress amplitude. These lead to further high stress cycles of large bending stress amplitude after Goodman correction, which results in significant damage to the gear, while for the case of wind speeds with 30% wind turbulence, the probability of  appearance of large bending stress amplitudes 
is low which is due to the WT shutting down because the wind speeds are out of the operational 
range, that is either lower than the cut-in wi nd speed or higher than the cut-out wind speed. 
Essentially high bending stresses amplitude have more significant impact on fatigue damage than 
low bending stress amplitude. Therefore, 10% or 20% wind turbulences lead  to higher sun gear 
damage than 30% wind turbulence. However, it shou ld be pointed out that the result obtained here 
i s  b y  a s s u m i n g  t h a t  t h e  W T  h a s  a n  i n s t a n t a n e o u s response to external excitation (wind speed 
variation). Lags in response of WT to transient wind speed variations may potentially expose the 
machine to high amplitude transient loads or bend ing stresses that may increase its damage risk. 
This transient effect is not considered in this pa per and is a topic that may be worthy of future 
research. 
6. Using SCADA Data for Long Term Damage Quantification 
As shown in the previous sections, short-term damage is calculated by defining an average 
wind speed and turbulence intensity and simula tion of gearbox dynamics. WT SCADA data is 
characterized by its low data sampling rates whereby only the average wind speed and the maximum, and minimum wind speed in ten minutes are recoded. Ther efore, a statistical method is 
used to estimate the standard deviation of ten minutes’ wind speed and then the turbulence 
intensity. The equation below is used [35]: 
σ

12 (17) 
I=σ୳
Uഥ (18) 
Wind speed data within the ten minutes being considered are taken as a sample data set with 
known mean, maximum and minimum va lues to derive the standard variation. Equation (17) is 
d e r i v e d  b y  t r a n s f o r m i n g  t h e  m e d i a n  w i n d  s p e e d  i n t o  m e a n  w i n d  s p e e d  r e f e r r i n g  t o  t h e  f o r m u l a  
given in [32]. Therefore, mean wind speed and turbulence intensity are two necessary parameters for short term gearbox damage prediction, which can be calculated as shown in the previous 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 2500.511.522.5x 10-5

Figure 14. Fatigue damage of a sun gear.
From Figure 14, it is also observed that damages to the sun gear due to wind speeds with 30%
turbulence intensity are lower compared to the cases with 10% and 20% turbulence intensity. The
reason for this can be explained by Figures 11 and 12. Wind turbulences of 10% or 20% at wind
speeds above the rated range cause a high probability of large mean bending stress and also large
bending stress amplitude. These lead to further high stress cycles of large bending stress amplitude
after Goodman correction, which results in signiﬁcant damage to the gear, while for the case of wind
speeds with 30% wind turbulence, the probability of appearance of large bending stress amplitudes is
low which is due to the WT shutting down because the wind speeds are out of the operational range,
that is either lower than the cut-in wind speed or higher than the cut-out wind speed. Essentially high
bending stresses amplitude have more signiﬁcant impact on fatigue damage than low bending stress
amplitude. Therefore, 10% or 20% wind turbulences lead to higher sun gear damage than 30% wind
turbulence. However, it should be pointed out that the result obtained here is by assuming that the WT
has an instantaneous response to external excitation (wind speed variation). Lags in response of WT to
transient wind speed variations may potentially expose the machine to high amplitude transient loads
or bending stresses that may increase its damage risk. This transient effect is not considered in this
paper and is a topic that may be worthy of future research.
6. Using SCADA Data for Long Term Damage Quantiﬁcation
As shown in the previous sections, short-term damage is calculated by deﬁning an average wind
speed and turbulence intensity and simulation of gearbox dynamics. WT SCADA data is characterized
by its low data sampling rates whereby only the average wind speed and the maximum, and minimum
wind speed in ten minutes are recoded. Therefore, a statistical method is used to estimate the standard
deviation of ten minutes’ wind speed and then the turbulence intensity. The equation below is
used [35]:
u=s
(vmax+vmin 2vmean )2+ (vmax vmin)2
12(17)
I=u
U(18)
Wind speed data within the ten minutes being considered are taken as a sample data set with
known mean, maximum and minimum values to derive the standard variation. Equation (17) is
derived by transforming the median wind speed into mean wind speed referring to the formula
given in [ 32]. Therefore, mean wind speed and turbulence intensity are two necessary parameters for
short term gearbox damage prediction, which can be calculated as shown in the previous sections.

Although the SCADA data used here was not recorded from the ﬁrst date when the WT was
operating, the cumulative damage calculation is still validated as linear damage theory assumes that
fatigue damage due to different stress levels are independent of each other and it can be linearly
accumulated. The nine months SCADA data recorded before the WT failed are divided into three
sections. Each section contains three months of SCADA data, which are further used to calculate the WT
fatigue damage. The wind speed data are analyzed and shown in Figure 17. The short-term damage
of each ten minute period is indexed by the mean wind speed and the calculated wind turbulence
intensities within this period. The corresponding wind data statistical results are shown in Table 3 and
in Figure 17. Table 3 shows the frequency of the mean wind speed exceeding 10 m/s and the turbulence
intensity larger than 15% in subsequent period intervals before failure. The accumulative fatigue

Comparing the fatigue damage of different compon ents, it shows that the sun gear damage is 
greater than that of the other components. For th e second and third stages of the gearbox, their 
pinions are more vulnerable than gears. This agrees  with the conclusion obtained in the short-term 
damage calculation. Comparing the damages accu mulated for the three periods, the components’ 
damages in the latest three months are larger th an that in the other two periods. The smallest 
damages are observed for the earliest three months  periods (nine months before). The damage may 
be due to the difference of the wind speed and turb ulence scale distribution as shown in Figure 16.

calculation. Comparing the damages accumulated for the three periods, the components’ damages

observed for the earliest three months periods (nine months before). The damage may be due to the

wind speed is above 10 m/s the damage to the gearbox increases signiﬁcantly. This leads to the high
damage estimated for the two periods. In addition, the turbulence intensities are also increasing, which
further causes serious damages to the gearbox. As observed in Figure 18, the accumulative fatigue
damage of the sun gear for the latest three months period is higher than 0.1. The total cumulative
damage of nine months reached 0.2, which increases the gearbox failure probability. As the SCADA

7. Conclusions
A long-term fatigue damage assessment method of WTs based on practical SCADA data is
developed in this paper. Short-term fatigue damage of WT gearboxes which considers the impact of
turbulence is ﬁrstly investigated. The main shaft mechanical torques under turbulent wind speeds as
external excitations are obtained for gear mechanics. A three-stage gearbox multibody dynamic model
which considers time-varying meshing stiffness is established to study the gears’ stress dynamics.
Gear stress cycle distributions and fatigue damages are then evaluated by a rain-ﬂow counting method
and Palmgren-Miner theory. To consider the impacts of mean stress level the Goodman linear equation

the SCADA data, wind turbulence intensities are calculated for each 10 min time interval. Then fatigue
damage is accumulated subsequently for long-term damage quantiﬁcation.
The quantiﬁcation results indicate that for the current design, the most vulnerable components
of WT gearbox are the sun gears. For the parallel stages, pinion damages are higher than those of
gears. Special consideration to protect or avoid fatigue damage of sun gears and pinions should be
carried out during the design stage. WT gearboxes show different sensitivity to different mean wind
speeds. Higher damage should be expected when the WT is operating under wind conditions that
being with mean wind speed above 10 m/s. Although with low data sampling rate, by assuming
that wind speed distribution obey a statistical law SCADA data can be used to quantify gearbox
long-term fatigue damage. The analysis result of nine months of SCADA data shows a prominent
gearbox damage tendency, which can be used for WT gearbox monitoring. The approach is capable
of effectively presenting the performance degradation of gearboxes’ different components due to
wind speed variation. The accuracy of this method is determined by the short-term fatigue damage
calculation which is affected by the variation of material/structural parameters and random external
excitation situations. Further validation and increased sample cases will be helpful to improve the
accuracy of this approach. In any case, the quantiﬁcation approach proposed here provides a useful
tool for wind farm maintenance prognosis.
