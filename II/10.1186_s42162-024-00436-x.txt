Introduction
Wind energy as a tidy renewable energy, the international wind resource storage space of 
regarding 53 trillion KWH/year, in theory, the development of 50% of the wind resources 
can meet the global electricity energy demand. China’s wind energy reserves are large, 
the spread of a wide range, development and utilization potential is huge. With the fast 
growth of renewable energy, wind turbines have become an important part of the world -
wide power mix. However, due to the long-term operation of wind turbines in complex 
and changeable environments, the survival environment of wind turbines is poor, and its 
service time is usually between 20 and 30 years. Due to the complex internal fan model, Energy Informatics
Abstract
A BP neural network incorporated regression forecast technique based upon 
fragment swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to design the state of crucial 
components of wind turbine so regarding realize mistake identification and 
detection. Firstly, specification recognition is carried out on the collection and 
tracking information of the system, and parameters connected to fault detection 
are extracted. Then, the residual optimization issue is made use of to establish the 
forecast model of nonlinear state evaluation and semantic network combination, 
and the gearbox temperature level or generator bearing are input as criteria right 
into the semantic network combination model and single model specifically, and the 
precision of the design is mirrored by the examination index. Lastly, BP design and 
PSO-BP combined forecast model are developed respectively by using the actual 
operation data of wind ranch SCADA, and the mistake state is evaluated according 
to whether the anticipated residual exceeds the set threshold, so regarding keep an 
eye on the temperature level of wind turbine transmission and generator bearing. 
By contrasting the data videotaped prior to and after the failing and making the 
information prediction analysis, the speculative results show that the forecast model 
established in this paper is viable for the device element fault detection.

multiple component structures, models and blade specifications, it is difficult to estab -
lish an accurate mechanism or knowledge model. Therefore, process monitoring, con -
troller design and fault diagnosis methods based on mechanism or knowledge model 
are difficult to apply to wind power generation process. Therefore, online monitoring, 
control and fault diagnosis for fans have gradually become an urgent research topic. 
Therefore, it is particularly vital to continue condition monitoring and fault analysis to 
the main bearing, gear box, generator and various other components which are prone to 
fault problems.
In literature [ 1], the stress unbalance fault of blade and tail is detected and analyzed, 
but the data calculation is large and the model is miscellaneous. In literature [ 2], the 
main state variables of the unit are quantitatively calculated to obtain the endurance 
limit of monitoring components and the consequences after failure. However, quanti -
tative analysis is only applicable to some working conditions. In literature [ 3], data is 
analyzed by Hilbert transform to identify the specific information of faults. However, 
vibration sensors need to be installed separately, and a large amount of data needs to 
be analyzed and processed by human-computer interaction, making automatic identifi -
cation difficult. Literature [ 4] uses equal-dimension entropy method to solve the prob -
lem that medium and long term power load forecasting is easily affected by uncertain 
interference factors, but its ability to be applied to unit equipment fault prediction needs 
to be verified in practice. In addition, based on the application and development of a 
variety of fault detection and diagnosis methods, the fault detection methods for wind 
power generation process have also found a suitable direction in various attempts. The 
model prediction method is applied in the detection of wind turbines in literature [ 5, 
6], so a variety of predictive control methods can be applied and tried on this basis. Lit -
erature [ 7] stated the optimization issue of maximum power tracking based upon wind 
power system. Based upon the monitoring study of voltage and current, active and 
reactive power, circuit related faults can be identified. Literary works [ 8, 9] has actually 
examined and summarized the grid-connected issues of wind power, so it can be seen 
that wind power generation system is huge and intricate, from small motor parts to large 
power grid-connected, all of which have vital research study value in fault detection. 
Traditional single surveillance approach is often hard to completely and accurately mir -
ror the operating condition of wind power units. Therefore, the fault detection method 
of wind generator based upon multivariate monitoring technology has actually progres -
sively obtained interest.
In this paper, a wind generator fault detection method based on the mixed BP neural 
network prediction algorithm is recommended to enhance the accuracy and integrity 
of fault detection. The BP semantic network is a sort of multi-layer semantic network, 
which readjusts the network specifications with the back-propagation algorithm to 
understand the mapping connection in between input and output. The BP semantic 
network has strong nonlinear approximation capabilities and self learning capabilities, 
which is suitable for processing complex nonlinear issues. When detecting the mis -
takes of a wind generator, the BP neural network can find out the mapping partnership 
between mistake qualities and mistake types to realize quick fault identification. The 
combinatorial forecasting algorithm combines several unique forecasting methods to 
form a comprehensive forecasting model to improve forecasting accuracy and stability.

When detecting wind turbine faults, the combined prediction algorithm can fully use 
the advantages of different prediction methods and improve the fault detection accuracy.
To build an effective fault detection model, this paper first collects the operation data 
and fault data of wind turbines. The data is then preprocessed, including filling in miss -
ing values, handling outliers and data normalization, to improve data quality and avail -
ability. In enhancement, feature extraction technology is likewise made use of to draw 
out fault features from the original information as input to the design. On the basis of 
data preprocessing and function extraction, this paper constructs a fault detection ver -
sion based upon BP semantic network combination prediction algorithm. The design 
contains numerous BP neural network complicated designs, each of which embraces dif -
ferent network structure and criterion Settings. Then, the model is educated utilizing 
the training data, and the network specifications are adjusted by the backpropagation 
formula, so that the design can properly recognize the mistake kind. In the process of 
training, cross validation and early stop method are made use of to stop the incident 
of overfitting. In order to validate the validity of the proposed wind generator fault 
detection design based on BP neural network Genetic algorithm Combined prediction 
(PSO-BP), experiments were executed on examination information collections. The 
experimental results show that the model can accurately identify different types of faults, 
and has high accuracy and stability. Compared with the traditional single BP prediction 
method, PSO-BP algorithm shows better performance in fault detection. In addition, the 
experimental results are analyzed and the effects of different factors on the performance 
of the model are discussed.
Scada system and data selection
Scada system introduction
The SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system is a computer-based 
automatic production process control and planning system. The system has been exten -
sively made use of in lots of areas, including electric power, metallurgy, oil, chemical, 
train and various other fields of data acquisition and control of the surveillance and 
control process. In the electric system, the SCADA system is the most made use of and 
mature modern technology. It plays a vital function in the remote control system, which 
can monitor and control area operation equipment to execute various features such as 
data acquisition, equipment control, measurement, modification of the settings and var -
ious alarm signal. The application of this system to collect and save various condition 
information of wind turbine can not only check the operation of wind power system, 
find uncommon prompt closure to stay clear of the occurrence of failure, but addi -
tionally give convenience for analyzing and forecasting the failing of the wind turbine 
[10–15].
Parameter selection of grey correlation degree
Using the grey relational degree analysis technique, the relationship between the ele -
ments in the system can be deeply discussed. In the process of implementing grey corre -
lation analysis, the selection of appropriate parameters is the key to ensure the accuracy 
and credibility of the analysis results. In predictive analysis methods, the internal cor -
relation among parameters is very important, and the sensitivity and accuracy of the

Zhang et al. Energy Informatics            (2024) 7:124 
model is also determined by selecting some parameters with high correlation for data 
analysis. Grey correlation analysis usually includes the following five steps [ 16–19]:
Step 1: Determine the moms and dad and child series, and prepare the data layout. 
Taking the temperature of generator gear box as an example, explore the crucial param -
eters related to monitoring, control and data collection. In this situation, the appropriate 
secondary data series consist of wind speed, power output, ambient temperature, cabin 
internal temperature, main bearing temperature, generator stator winding temperature, 
speed reading, and gear oil pump operating pressure.
Step 2: Perform a de-dimensional strengthening operation on the data, the size of 
the data and the unit of measurement are often different, so the normalization process 
needs to be performed, common normalization methods include: implement standard -
ized processing and set initial values to standardize the initial state.
Step 3: determine the mother and child sequences, take the generator gearbox tem -
perature as an example, and study its related SCADA parameters. Therefore, in this 
study, the temperature level of the generator gear box is taken as the parent sequence, 
and the wind speed, power, ambient temperature, device area temperature, main bearing 
temperature, generator stator winding temperature, generator rate, equipment oil pump 
pressure and so forth are selected as the subsequence. Finally, the gray correlation coef -
ficient in between the parent sequence and the subsequence can be resolved.
Step 4: Solve the correlation degree value.
Step 5: Sort the correlation values and draw a conclusion. Based on this, the grey cor -
relation degree theory is introduced to quantitatively analyze the correlation of the mon -
itoring information of the douply fed asynchronous wind turbine, and the parameters 
with high correlation are selected for subsequent data analysis.
Since the value of each parameter is large or small, the initialization method is selected 
here to normalize the parameter according to the above steps to solve the grey correla -
tion coefficient. The grey correlation coefficient is shown in Formula (1).
δi(k)=min
imin
k|x0(k)|+λmax
imax
k|x0(k)−xi(k)|
|x0(k)−xi(k)|+λmax
imax
k|x0(k)−xi(k)| (1)
where  λ is the resolution coefficient and its value is (0,1), which is usually taken as 0.5 
according to experience; x0(k) is the objective function; xi(k) is the correlation between 
each factor sequence and the target sequence, evaluated by the grey correlation degree. 
The correlation coefficient is between [0,1], The closer the value of xi(k) is to 1, the 
higher the degree of correlation between factor sequence and target sequence data. The 
grey correlation coefficient of generator gearbox temperature is shown in Table  1.
The variant fad of the correlation coefficients between different specifications and the 
temperature level of the generator gearbox is shown in Table  1. The average worths of 
each consider various dimensions are 0.972, 0.483, 0.994, 0.992, 0.986, 0.896, 0.982 and 
0.825, specifically. According to the grey correlation degree theory, wind speed, main 
bearing side temperature level, generator stator winding temperature, engine rate, inner 
oil pressure of gearbox oil and active power of inverter are selected as the attributes to 
study the temperature level fault of gearbox side of the generator main shaft.

Regression prediction model
The BP model
BP neural network is a multilayer feedforward semantic network making use of error 
backpropagation for prediction, which has the characteristics of strong adaptability and 
self learning. In this paper, the prediction model of front bearing temperature is estab -
lished by using BP network to detect the state of wind turbine. In this study, three layers 
of neural networks are used, including input layer, hidden layer and output layer. The 
specific network layout is shown in Fig.  1 [20, 21].
Where the meanings of different variables are as follows (as shown in Table  2):
In a BP neural network, information is circulated from the input layer to the hidden 
layer and the output layer. When the network specifications are trained, the network 
parameters are changed forward from the output layer to lower errors. As the neural 
network remains to learn, the training error will certainly lessen and smaller. Amongst 
them, the variety of neural nodes in the input layer of the neural network is determined 
by the number of input features, the variety of nodes in the output layer is identified by 
the number of design categories, and the variety of neural nodes in the degree. The hid -
den layer is figured out according to the complying with empirical Formula (2):
n1=√
m+n+a,n1/greaterorequalslantlog2n1 (2)  
where n1 is the number of neurons in the hidden layer; m is the number of neuron nodes 
in the output layer; n is the number of neuron nodes in the input layer; a is an arbitrary 
constant between 1 and 10.
In the modeling procedure, the information is divided right into modeling data and 
experimental information, and the specifications in the modeling data are input into the 
BP network, such as establishing the matching network criteria (the optimum variety of 
actions is 5000, the target error is 0.001, and the knowing rate is 0.01). The above info is 
transmitted to the output layer through the hidden layer. If the mistake is higher than 
0.001, it does not satisfy the needs, and the mistake is reversely transferred to the upper-
layer network, and the criteria in the network are redetermined. When the mistake is 
less than or equal to 0.001, the above operation is quit and the design is established. The 
flowchart of BP network modeling principle is shown in Fig.  2.
Particle swarm optimization
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a kind of intelligent random optimization algo -
rithm, which is simple to operate, converges quickly, and does not have too many param -
eters to adjust [ 20]. The principle of the algorithm is that in the D-dimensional vector 
space, each particle i has velocity vi=[vi1,vi2,.,vid]T and position xi=[xi1,xi2,.,xid]T, 
then the updating formula of velocity and position is as follows Formula (3) (4):
vk+1
id=ωvk
id+c1r1(pk
bestid−xk
id)+c2r2(gk
bestid−xk
id) (3)
xk+1
id=xk
id+vk+1
id (4)
where d ∈[1,D] is the dimension; ω is the inertia weight; k is the variety of current ver -
sions; c1 and c2 are finding out factors. r1 and r2 are arbitrary numbers in the interval 
[0,1].

The inertia weight ω plays a crucial duty in the performance of the algorithm, and the 
selection of the inertia weight ω straight impacts the worldwide search capability and 
the local search capacity. Therefore, the linear adjustment strategy is adopted to control 
inertia weight ω, which can make the algorithm have good global and local search ability 
throughout the whole process and meet the practical requirements. (as shown in For -
mula (5))
ω=ωmax−(ωmax−ωmin)·iter/itermax (5)
where ωmax and ωmin are the maximum and minimum inertia weights respectively; iter 
and itermax are the current and maximum iterations respectively.
The PSO-BP model
The selection of first weights and thresholds in the BP semantic network application is 
arbitrary, which leads to the look of minimal local convergence points and minimizes 
the regularization impact. To resolve this trouble, bit flock optimization was used to 
enhance the initial weights and thresholds of the BP semantic network. The results Table 2  The meanings of different variables in the bp neural network structure

showed that this technique overcomes the challenge that the population conveniently 
falls under regional minima, accelerates the convergence price and enhances predic -
tion precision of BP semantic network algorithm [ 22]. In various researches of artificial 
neural network and deep learning algorithm, its application in fault detection is gradu -
ally extensive, and it has a unique role in the fault detection of wind turbines [ 23–25].

According to the principle of neural network structure, the BP connect with 1–12-1 
structure is taken on in this paper, whose network learning rate η = 0.1. Among them, the 
activation function of the network hiding layer is selected as tansigmoid function, the 
transfer function of the output layer is chosen as purelin function, the training function 
is selected as trainlm function, and the loss function is chosen as MSE function. And 
according to the principle of bit flock optimization, the initial placement and rate of ran -

Modeling process
Model building
Combined with the normal operation data of the fan of Unit 22 of a wind farm in Febru -
ary 2023, the modeling process of the combined prediction model with the temperature 
of the generator gear box as the target parameter is described as follows:
(1) Process the modeling data and divide the generator gearbox side temperature data 
into modeling data and experimental data.
(2) Establish BP model and PSO-BP prediction model with modeling data.
(3) Data preprocessing: The gathered speculative data is divided into a set of training 
samples, a collection of confirmation examples and a collection of examination samples 
according to a particular proportion.
(4) Initialize the PSO specifications, upgrade the particle rate and position, acquire 
the optimum specification values of PSO, make use of the optimum parameter values 
to enhance the weights and thresholds of BP neural network, and build the PSO-BP net -
work model;
(5) The training collection is utilized to educate the PSO-BP network model. After the 
training is completed, the validation set and the outcome category outcomes are utilized 
to examine the version and carry out the following round of training. The procedure is 
duplicated until the discontinuation condition is gotten to;
(6) After the training of PSO-BP network model is completed, the anticipated worth 
of examination set information is compared with the genuine value to assess the fault 
medical diagnosis category effect of this model.
(7) 150 random groups of experimental data among 2500 groups of data were selected 
for combined model test. The anticipated and actual temperature level curves of the 
two versions were received Fig.  4. As can be seen from the figure, the forecasted values 
of the two combined designs are basically regular with the actual temperature worths, 
and the prediction of the gearbox side temperature is very accurate, and the modeling is 
successful.
(8) Comparing the BP design with the combined PSO-BP model, it can be seen that 
the precision of the mixed PSO-BP design is higher. As displayed in Fig.  5, the recurring 
variation and mistake variety of the consolidated PSO-BP design is little, while the mis -
take of the BP model is larger. It can be seen that the prediction of the combined PSO-
BP design is a lot more precise and has the most effective prediction result.

Model evaluation
Since the precision of various prediction models can not be directly compared, this 
paper introduces various assessment indexes to assess the accuracy of the prediction 
results of single BP version and mixed model PSO-BP . Generally used analysis indexes 
are: maximum outright mistake, ordinary outright mistake, indicate square mistake, ori -
gin indicate square mistake, typical outright portion mistake, median mistake and more. 
As the magnitude of the mistake can be seen from the number over, the mean square 
mistake is used in this paper to represent the level of diffusion, the typical outright error 
can be made use of to gauge the total ordinary degree, and the ordinary absolute percent 
error is utilized to stand for the volatility of the model. The expression of each assess -
ment index is as follows:
Root means square error (as shown in Formula (7)):

Based on the above 150 sets of data, the evaluation indicators of different models are 
calculated respectively, as shown in Table  3.
As can be seen from Table  3, there are errors in the training results of BP and PSO-
BO models, but the comprehensive error is not large. The accuracy of each index of the 
combined model PSO-BP is improved, which verifies the stability and precision of the 
proposed combined model.
Case analysis and simulation
The gearbox fault detection
In order to further verify the usefulness of the combined version based upon BP neural 
network, the fault detection of key parts of wind turbines is performed by incorporating 
the real data of multiple generators. SCADA data during normal operation is selected 
to establish PSO-BP combined prediction model, residual error is processed by sliding 
window and appropriate threshold is set. The setting of threshold is usually determined 
according to empirical values and multiple experimental results. When the residual error 
exceeds the threshold, it indicates that the unit may be faulty and you need to check 
whether the unit is faulty. The following examples illustrate that both the combined pre -
diction model based on BP model and PSO-BP can diagnose anomalies and detect faults 
in advance.
The research object is the gearbox side temperature of Unit 10 of a wind farm, and 
the modeling parameters are wind speed, main bearing side temperature, generator sta -
tor winding temperature, engine speed, internal oil pressure of gearbox oil and active 
power of inverter. Modeling data from February to March (all modeling data are fault-
free data) and 2,500 sets of data from April 1 to 20 were used for model verification. The 
comparison curve between predicted temperature and actual temperature of BP model 
and PSO-BP combined model was shown in Fig.  6, and the residual error of predicted 
temperature was shown in Fig.  7. Through calculation, the modeling accuracy of the two 
models is shown in Table  4, since the maximum absolute error of gearbox temperature 
of Unit 10 in the prediction of the two models is about 4, the fault occurrence threshold 
is set at 4. As can be seen from Figs.  6 and 7, the forecast residual exceeds the threshold 
for the first time at 798, and the error becomes sharply larger after 2238. Therefore, fault 
alarm can be conducted from the 798 points where the threshold is exceeded for the first 
time, so as to realize the early warning of gearbox fault.
The version accuracy of the PSO-BP design and BP model in the information modeling 
from February to March (modeling data are fault-free data) is shown in Table  4. It can be 
seen once again that the precision analysis of the PSO-BP design is extra exact than that 
of the BP model. Consequently, after the failure, the PSO-BP design can spot the mistake 
information much more clearly. As an example, at 798 factors, the anticipated residual 
error of the BP model is 4.871, while the predicted residual error of the PSO-BP design 
is 5.0472. At 2238 point, the predicted residual error of the BP model is 5.4551, while the 
forecasted residual error of the PSO-BP model is 5.7936. Because the anticipated data is

close to real value, the larger the anticipated recurring after the mistake takes place, the 
easier the mistake is to be discovered, which better discusses the precision of PSO-BP 
version.
The data of Unit 27 in the same wind farm from July 1 to August 20 were selected for 
modeling, and 1243 data from August 21 to 29 were analyzed for fault. The temperature 
prediction results of gearbox of different models and the prediction residual curves were 
obtained, as shown in Figs.  8 and 9. The maximum absolute error of gearbox tempera -
ture of Unit 27 in the prediction of the two models is also about 4, so the fault occur -
rence threshold is set at 4 too.
As shown in Figs.  8 and 9, the forecast residual exceeded the threshold for the first 
time around 829–830 points, and again and frequently exceeded the threshold at 1020 
points, indicating that Unit 27 was in an abnormal state. The unit returned to normal 
operation after briefly exceeding the threshold the day before, but the residual gradu -
ally increased and continued to exceed the threshold in the next few days, and the fail -
ure was determined at about 830 points. Therefore, the fault can be effectively predicted 
according to the residual value, that is, when the residual starts to exceed the thresh -
old, the fault warning can be performed. The generator, gear box, spindle and frequency 
converter of wind turbine equipment are all fault prone parts, and the consequences of 
failure in these parts are very serious. In order to demonstrate that the fault method

proposed in this paper can also be applied to the detection of other fan parts, the main 
bearing of the same type of double fed asynchronous wind turbine is analyzed as follows. 
Similarly, using wind speed, gearbox temperature, frequency converter temperature, 
generator stator winding temperature, engine speed and internal oil pressure of gearbox 
oil as parameters, a prediction model with main bearing side temperature as the target 
parameter is established. Finally, an example is given to demonstrate that this modeling 
method is also applicable to spindle fault detection.
The main bearing fault detection
The SCADA data of Unit 29 of the same wind farm is selected to analyze the tempera -
ture of the main bearing. Data from April and May were used for modeling, 2328 data 
from June 10 to 20 were analyzed, and BP and PSO-BP model prediction methods were 
used for data prediction analysis and prediction residual analysis of spindle temperature. 
The predicted data curves and prediction residual curves of the two models were shown 
in Figs.  10 and 11. Since the maximum absolute error of the main bearing temperature 
is about 1 in the prediction of the two models, the fault occurrence threshold is set as 1. 
The training accuracy of the two models is shown in Table  5.Table 4  Comparison of model accuracy between BP and PSO-BP in Unit 10

As can be seen from Figs.  10 and 11, the residual temperature prediction of the main 
bearing of Unit 29 undoubtedly went beyond the limit value for the first time at 1656, 
and afterwards the recurring started to expand quickly, indicating that the main bearing 
was unusual. Consequently, an alarm system can be elevated when the recurring sur -
passes the threshold for the first time, hence staying clear of the event of failures. Via the 
above analysis, the combined prediction model is additionally suitable for the running 
state discovery and fault warning of bearings.
Conclusion
In this paper, we recommend a wind generator fault detection technique based upon 
genetic algorithm-optimized BP semantic network combination prediction algorithm 
and verify its performance via experiments. This technique can completely utilize the 
benefits of various prediction techniques and boost the accuracy and dependability 
of fault detection. The research study web content mostly consists of the study of the 
working state and mistake diagnosis of wind turbines based upon SCADA monitoring 
data. First of all, the appropriate input parameters of the fault vulnerable parts of wind

turbines (generator main bearing and gearbox) are chosen from the SCADA monitor -
ing data. After that PSO-BP mixed prediction version is used, and compared with the 
solitary BP version, the results show that the precision of each analysis index of the con -
solidated prediction design is higher than that of the solitary prediction version, which 
verifies the accuracy of the PSO-BP integrated prediction version. Lastly, according to 
the genuine SCADA data collected in the wind farm, the fault prone parts (generator 
bearings and gearbox) of various units are evaluated, which verifies that the consolidated 
prediction version technique based upon BP neural network recommended in this paper 
is precise and reliable in identifying the failing of crucial components of wind turbines, 
and plays an essential function in the maintenance of wind turbine tools. It is beneficial 
to ensure the lasting stable operation of wind power generation equipment.
In addition, the application of BP model and PSO-BP model in wind turbine fault 
detection is proposed in this paper, but the related prediction model can also be applied 
to many other aspects, such as cooling system valve opening prediction, short-term 
power load prediction, photovoltaic system short-term power prediction, power trans -
former fault diagnosis, etc., which shows the wide applicability of the proposed model 
[26–29]. Future work will further optimize the model structure and parameter Settings 
to improve the generalization ability and robustness of the model. At the same time, 
more feature extraction and fusion technologies will be explored to further improve the 
accuracy and real time of fault detection. In addition, it will also focus on the applica -
tion of other advanced machine learning algorithms in wind turbine fault detection to 
provide more powerful technical support for the development of the wind power field.
