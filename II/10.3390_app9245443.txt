Abstract: Due to their high transmission ratio, high load carrying capacity and small size, planetary
gears are widely used in the transmission systems of wind turbines. The planetary gearbox is the
core of the transmission system of a wind turbine, but because of its special structure and complex
internal and external excitation, the vibration signal spectrum shows strong nonlinearity, asymmetry
and time variation, which brings great trouble to planetary gear fault diagnosis. The traditional
time-frequency analysis technology is insu cient in the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis
of wind turbines. For this reason, we propose a new method of planetary gearbox fault diagnosis
based on Compressive sensing, Two-dimensional variational mode decomposition (2D-VMD) and
full-vector spectrum technology. Firstly, the nonlinear reconstruction and noise reduction of the
signal is carried out by using compressed sensing, and then the signal with multiple degrees of
freedom is adaptively decomposed into multiple sets of characteristic scale components by using
2D-VMD. Then, R √©nyi entropy is used as the optimization index of 2D-VMD analysis performance
to extract the e ective target intrinsic mode function (IMF) component, reconstruct the dynamics
signal in the planetary gearbox, and improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Then, using the full-vector
spectrum technique, the homologous information collected by numerous sensors is data layer fused
in the spatial domain and the time domain to increase the comprehensiveness and certainty of the
fault information. Finally, the Teager‚ÄìKaiser energy operator is used to demodulate the potential
low-frequency dynamics frequency characteristics from the high-frequency domain and detect the
fault characteristic frequency. Furthermore, the correctness and validity of the method are veriÔ¨Åed by
the fault test signal of the planetary gearbox.

1. Introduction
In recent years, environmental pollution has aroused the attention of various countries, and clean
energy such as wind energy and solar energy has become the most important renewable energy in
the world. With the expansion of the installation and operation scale of global wind turbines, the
maintenance of wind turbines has become one of the most important research topics in the Ô¨Åeld of
wind power. The wind turbine unit is in a complex environment with strong random wind load for a
long time in operation, and the internal and external excitation is complex, which easily causes the
failure of key parts of the transmission system, and then leads to the shutdown of the whole unit.
Therefore, research on the structural health monitoring (SHM) of key components of wind turbines

plays an important role in ensuring the safe and stable operation of the unit [ 1]. Structural health
monitoring (SHM) can e ectively avoid early failures of the wind turbine drive system and reduce
maintenance and repair costs [2,3].
The planetary gearbox is the core of the wind turbine drive system. It has the advantages of
compact structure, high transmission ratio, and small volume. It is mainly composed of planetary
gears, planet carriers, sun gears, ring gears, boxes, and bearings. The planetary gearbox has several
groups of gears engaged at the same time during transmission. Compared with the Ô¨Åxed shaft gear
transmission, the planetary gearbox has special structure and dynamic characteristics, which also
leads to its complex dynamics response, thus increasing the spectral complexity of the vibration
signal [ 4‚Äì6]. The frequency spectrum of vibration signals of a planetary gearbox has typical asymmetry
and nonlinearity due to the rotation of planetary gears [ 7‚Äì9]. The literature [ 10,11] summarizes the
research methods of wind turbine fault detection proposed in recent years. The research shows that
the traditional time-frequency analysis technology has some shortcomings in the condition monitoring
and fault detection of wind turbines.
In view of these shortcomings, in recent years, researchers in the Ô¨Åeld of rotating machinery fault
detection have proposed many new methods, such as: Feng et al. [ 4] proposed a joint amplitude
frequency demodulation analysis method based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD)
and an energy separation algorithm. Zhang et al. [ 12] combined a blind deconvolution algorithm
and a vibration model to detect seed faults in a helicopter planetary gearbox. Lei et al. [ 13,14]
proposed four kinds of planetary gearbox fault detection parameters: root mean square of the Ô¨Ålter
signal, normalization of the positive amplitude of the di erence spectrum between an unknown
signal and a healthy signal, carrier series based on di erence spectrum, and cumulative amplitude
based on energy ratio. The key task of planetary gearbox fault detection is to determine the gear
characteristic frequency [ 15]. Feng et al. [ 16] used the adaptive optimal kernel method to extract the
frequency components and time-varying characteristics of the non-stationary signals of the planetary
gearbox. Cheng et al. [ 17] proposed a planetary gear fault detection method based on ensemble
empirical mode decomposition entropy feature fusion. Li et al. [ 18] proposed a fault detection
method for the planetary gearbox based on improved multi-scale symbolic dynamic entropy and
minimum-redundancy maximum-relevancy.
Most of the above methods are for the case of measuring a single-stage planetary transmission
system with a single sensor. However, planetary gear transmission systems generally consist of
multi-stage planetary transmissions. At the same time, multiple sets of planetary gears and sun gears
along with planetary gears and ring gears are meshed simultaneously. The vibrations caused by
these meshing pairs are mutually coupled, superimposed, and neutralized, which greatly a ects the
decoupling of fault characteristics, increases the complexity of the frequency spectrum, and further
increases the di culty of fault detection [19]. Therefore, it is necessary to study the method specially
used to detect faults in a planetary gearbox with multi-stage planetary rows. According to the
characteristics of the vibration signal of the planetary gear transmission system, using a multi-sensor
data fusion method is a feasible method. Multi-sensor fusion has always been one of the key areas
of data analysis [ 20], and it is an e ective method to solve the fault detection problem of mechanical
systems [ 21]. Multi-sensor data fusion enhances the e ectiveness and success rate of fault monitoring
by providing complementary information [ 22]. The information collected by multiple sensors
simultaneously can overcome the problems of uncertainty and low accuracy in fault recognition due to
the single-sided information of a single sensor, and also overcome the complexity of environmental
noise and external complicated excitation, thereby improving the robustness and reliability of fault
detection [ 23]. Multi-sensor information fusion can be divided into three grades [ 24,25], in which data
level fusion directly and synchronously processes multiple sensors‚Äô data from the tested object. This
level of data fusion contains the most direct and reliable information of the measured object and can
provide the most accurate troubleshooting results [ 26]. However, in the research on fault monitoring
and detection of rotating machinery based on multiple sensors, data-level fusion methods mostly rely
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

on artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence methods such as neural networks and support vector machines [ 27‚Äì29], and
there are few research works on multi-sensor information fusion in the Ô¨Åeld of data layers [30,31].
The fault detection method based on multi-sensor data fusion needs to solve three problems in
practical application [ 32]; these are: (1) how to remove noise e ectively, (2) how to improve the fault
feature, that is, the resolution of the signal, and (3) how to fuse the data of multiple sensors scientiÔ¨Åcally
and e ectively on the data layer. Next, this manuscript elaborates on the above three issues.
Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Local mean decomposition (LMD) are classical signal
detecting methods proposed in recent years. However, research shows that the EMD and LMD
methods also have the following shortcomings in signal detection and feature extraction: (1) The
robustness of anti-noise is weak [ 33]; (2) the ine cient ability of decoupling frequency components [ 34];
(3) multivariate data cannot be processed at the same time; and (4) the mode mixing problem [ 35].
These shortcomings greatly a ect the accuracy of signal processing [36].
In 2014, Dragomiretskiy and Zosso [ 37] proposed a new multi-resolution modal decomposition
method called variational mode decomposition (VMD). Since it was published, it has been widely
considered by scholars in various Ô¨Åelds, and the method has been applied to medical treatment [ 38],
image processing [ 39], Ô¨Ånancial analysis [ 40], electrocardiogram (ECG) [ 41] and other Ô¨Åelds. The results
show that VMD has an accurate mathematical model and theoretical basis in theory, and is superior to
EMD and LMD [ 42] in signal separation and noise robustness. In the aspect of rotating machinery
fault detection, researchers have carried out in-depth research. Zhang et al. [ 43] used VMD to detect
defect signals in di erent positions of rolling bearings in multistage centrifugal pumps. Li et al. [ 44]
proposed a new rolling bearing fault detection method based on variational mode decomposition
and improved the Kernel Extremum Learning Machine. Li et al. [ 45] proposed an independent VMD
method based on correlation analysis to adaptively extract weak fault features and compound fault
features of wheelset bearings. An and Tang [ 46] proposed a bearing fault detection method based on
energy distribution variational mode decomposition. However, the above research is still based on
single-sensor information collection. Dragomiretskiy extended VMD to two-dimensional areas and
proposed two-dimensional variational mode decomposition [ 47] in 2014, which makes simultaneous
analysis and noise reduction of multivariate data possible.
The application of multiple sensors inevitably brings another problem, that is, the synchronous
processing of massive monitoring data. The on-line condition monitoring system of the wind turbine
functions by using multiple sensors installed in di erent key positions of the unit to collect real-time
vibration acceleration, velocity, stress and strain and other parameters synchronously. Long-cycle
real-time acquisition will generate a huge amount of data [ 48]. The huge amounts of data used for data
transmission, storage, and real-time processing pose signiÔ¨Åcant challenges [ 49]. At the same time, big
data brings problems such as noise accumulation [ 50]. Therefore, research on multi-sensor data noise
reduction methods has attracted researchers in various Ô¨Åelds. Compressed sensing (CS) is a new signal
acquisition technology, also known as compressed sampling [ 51]. As a new sampling theory, it develops
the sparse characteristics of the signal, obtains discrete samples of the signal by random sampling,
and then reconstructs the signal perfectly by a nonlinear reconstruction algorithm [ 52]. The recovered
signal is sparse and robust at the same time [ 53]. Compressed sensing technology is widely used in
signal denoising and feature extraction in various professional Ô¨Åelds. Du et al. [ 54] applied compressed
sensing theory to wireless sensor networks, and proposed a method of data sampling compression
and reconstruction based on distributed compressed sensing theory. Guo [ 55] applied compressible
sensing theory to the data recovery problem of practical sensor networks. Chen et al. [ 56] proposed a
new sparse extraction of impulses by an adaptive dictionary scheme to extract impulse components.
Based on the above analysis, in order to solve the problem of planetary gearbox fault detection with
multi-stage planetary rows, this paper proposes a new method of planetary gear fault detection with
multi-sensor compressed sensing, 2D-VMD and full-vector spectrum theory. The paper is arranged as
follows: in the preface, we review the recently proposed planetary gear fault detection method, and
explain the necessity of studying the planetary gearbox fault detection method that is specially used

to detect faults in a planetary gearbox with multi-stage planetary rows. In Section 2, we introduce
compressed sensing, 2D-VMD, R √©nyi entropy and full-vector spectrum theory, and study the sparsity
and noise robustness of compressed sensing in detail. A new method of planetary gear fault detection
based on multi-sensor compressed sensing, 2D-VMD and full-vector spectrum is proposed. In Section 3,
the synchronous acquisition of multivariate planetary gear tooth failure test data is carried out by using
the planetary gear fault detection test-bed, and the spectrum characteristics of planetary gear tooth
failure are studied in detail by using the proposed method. The fault features are extracted accurately,
and the correctness and e ectiveness of the method are proved. The conclusions are presented in
Section 4.
2. Theory of Method
The application of multiple sensors brings the problem of massive data, using compressed
sensing technology to collect information at a sampling frequency far lower than Nyquist sampling
frequency. Compared with the data before processing, the nonlinear reconstruction algorithm perfectly
reconstructs the signal. The processed signal has both sparsity and robustness, avoiding the redundancy
of the collected information. The algorithm is as follows:
Suppose a one-dimensional discrete time signal X[50]:
X= (x1,x2xN)T(1)
The sparse basis matrix  is used to calculate the sparse time signal X:
 = ['1,'2'N]T(2)
X=X
'isi (3)
where'iis the i-th of Northogonal basis vectors in the space, and the corresponding siis the coe cient
of the corresponding orthogonal basis vector.
Select the measurement matrix Fand calculate the observation value y:
F= [1,2::: N] (4)
y=FX (5)
where1,2::: Nis the column vector of the measurement matrix F.
The sensing matrix Qis as follows:
Q=F (6)
If there is a constant , so that for any Ksparse vector x(kxk0K), it satisÔ¨Åes the restricted
equidistant characteristic, and then the sparse signal can be e ectively and completely recovered [ 57]:
(1 )kxk2
2kFxk2
2(1+)kxk2
2(7)
In each iteration, the column vector having the largest projection coe cient in the sensing matrix
is selected by the residual to form the recovery matrix
F[58], and the column vector having the largest
projection coe cient in the sensing matrix must be zeroed each time it is updated:
$j=

i=argmax$j (9)
wherei 1is the residual of the i-1th iteration, iis the column vector of the sensing matrix Q,i

Solve the Moore‚ÄìPenrose pseudo-inverse of the recovery matrix, and then based on ModiÔ¨Åed

Q 1= (L 1)TD 1L 1(10)

and the reconstruction vectorxiin each iteration until the Ô¨Ånal requirement is reached, and the Ô¨Ånal

i=y 
Fxi (12)
We hope to Ô¨Ånd a method that can perform a frequency division operation on signals with multiple
degrees of freedom at the same time, in order to achieve the Ô¨Åltering e ect, and can maintain the
coupling relationship between the original signals to the greatest extent. Therefore, we use the recently
proposed 2D-VMD technique to adaptively decompose signals with three degrees of freedom into
multiple sets of feature scale components. Then, R √©nyi entropy is used as the optimization index of
2D-VMD analysis performance to measure the correlation and coupling between the characteristic
scale components of various degrees of freedom in di erent states. The signal is reconstructed using
the extracted e ective target IMF component to improve the signal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio.
The essence of 2D-VMD is a non-recursive and completely adaptive decomposition of the original
function to obtain a speciÔ¨Åed number of modal components. Let the expression of the synthesized
two-degree-of-freedom directional vibration signal sequence be f(x), which is equivalent to solving the
following optimization problem [47]:

The above processing reduces the inÔ¨Çuence of some external noise on the fault feature information
to some extent, but the energy of the fault feature information will inevitably leak due to the Ô¨Åltering
processing. However, we can use the IMF component with the smallest energy leakage to complete the
fault diagnosis of many typical nonlinear dynamic systems. Therefore, screening the IMF component
with the smallest amount of energy leakage is the key to optimizing 2D-VMD technology. As an
eective tool to quantify the correlation and coupling between systems, R √©nyi entropy is well applied
in fault diagnosis and other Ô¨Åelds. The more characteristic fault information contained in the IMF
component in the fault state, the smaller the value of R √©nyi entropy, and the smaller the correlation and
coupling degree between the fault and the healthy system. Therefore, the extraction of the e ective
target IMF component is completed by calculating the R √©nyi entropy between each IMF component in
the fault state and the healthy planetary gearbox signal, thereby achieving the purpose of improving the
signal-to-noise ratio of the signal and optimizing the targets of 2D-VMD. The R √©nyi entropy algorithm
is as follows:
Uncorrelated vectors are orthogonalized using Schmidt orthogonalization.

We hope to demodulate the characteristic frequency of a low-frequency fault with higher accuracy
by a better demodulation method, so as to e ectively avoid the windowing e ect brought by the
traditional method. The energy operator has a good time resolution for the instantaneous change
of any discrete-time signal, and can e ectively detect the transient components in the signal. The
detection signal has been decomposed into a certain number of single-component signals by 2D-VMD
in the above, which lays the foundation for the use of energy operators.
The Teager‚ÄìKaiser energy operator can measure the instantaneous energy change of non-linear
and unstable signals. For any signal h(t), the Teager‚ÄìKaiser energy operator Yis deÔ¨Åned as [63‚Äì65]:

The planetary gearbox has a special structure and complex internal and external excitation,
which makes the vibration signal spectrum show strong nonlinear, asymmetric and time-varying
characteristics. In this paper, a new fault detection method for the planetary gearbox is proposed
by combining compressed sensing, 2D-VMD, full-vector spectrum technology and energy operator
demodulation. The speciÔ¨Åc process is as follows:
1. Signal extraction: Ô¨Årstly, several vibration acceleration sensors are arranged in the key position
of the planetary gearbox, and the state signals of the planetary gearbox are collected synchronously.
2. Signal preprocessing: The original signals collected by multiple sensors are preprocessed, and
the signals that can be sparsely represented are subsampled with compressed sensing technology.
Then, the atoms in the sensing matrix that have the greatest correlation with the residual are selected
through greedy iteration to achieve signal vector approximation and complete signal deposition.
3. State information enhancement: the noise reduction signal is decomposed adaptively into
multiple sets of feature scale components by the 2D-VMD technique, and R √©nyi entropy is used to
measure the linear correlation of information as an optimization index of 2D-VMD performance,
improve the signal-to-noise ratio, enhance the state information, and extract the fault features contained
in the e ective target IMF component.
4. Vibration signal fusion: using the full-vector spectrum technique, the homologous information
collected by multiple sensors is data layer fused in the spatial domain and the time domain to increase
the comprehensiveness and certainty of the fault information.
5. Fault detection: the envelope spectrum of amplitude modulation and frequency modulation
signal is demodulated by the energy operator, and then the frequency characteristic of low-frequency
signal is restored by Fourier transform.
The Ô¨Çow chart of the proposed method is shown in Figure 1.

Compared with fixed shaft gear drive and single-stage planetary gear drive systems, the 
dynamics response of the multi-stage planetary gear drive system is characterized by high complexity, high nonlinearity, complex internal an d external excitation, and strong unpredictability 
of the operation environment. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in the

sidebands. The non-stationary feat ures are also clearly picked up while effectively decomposing the

Multi-channel homologous information gathering realizes the superposition and 
complementarity of the information of each degree of  freedom, and fully reflects the integrity of the 
original information. Figure 9 shows the spectrum diagram of the broken tooth state of the planetary 
gearbox and the local magnification of part of the meshing frequency obtained by multi-channel acquisition and full-vector spectrum processing. As shown in Figure 9a, in the spectrum diagram, the 
sun gear in the broken tooth state will have a peak value at its engagement frequency and its 
frequency doubling, and will gene rate periodic impact signal ( f
s = 20.84 Hz). Due to the influence of 
manufacturing error, there is a certain difference in  the impact characteristics between the solar wheel 
and the three planetary gears. The local fault charac teristic frequency of the solar wheel will become 
fs/3 = 6.947 Hz and there will be a peak value at its frequency doubling. At the same time, based on 
the modulation effect of the transmission effect of the system on the vibration signal, the peak value will appear at the absolute rotation frequency f
c and its frequency doubling of the planetary frame. 
Based on the above factors, the peak value will appear at the frequency of () / 3mc skf mf m n f¬±¬± ¬±

In Figure 9, the partial fault frequency information of the broken tooth sun gear is analyzed. It
can be found that the feature information is all distributed in a relatively high-frequency domain range.
Because the characteristic frequency ( fs/3=6.947 Hz) of the local fault solar wheel, the absolute rotation
frequency ( fc=1.45 Hz) of the planetary rack, and the absolute rotation frequency ( fa=6.67 Hz) of the
solar wheel are too small, they will be a ected by external complex excitation, internal excitation, noise
and other signals, and the modulation will disappear in the low-frequency range, which has a great
impact on fault diagnosis. Therefore, we use the Teager‚ÄìKaiser energy operator method to demodulate
the potential low-frequency broken-tooth fault frequency modulated into the high-frequency region.
The result is shown in Figure 10. It can be seen from Figure 10 that there are peaks at the local fault
characteristic frequency of the sun wheel ( nfs/3), the absolute rotation frequency of the sun wheel
(mfa), and the absolute rotation frequency ( kfc) of the planet carrier (such as 5 fc=7.5Hz, 8 fc=12 Hz,
2fa=13.5 Hz, 5 fa=33.5 Hz, 2 fs=42 Hz, and 3 fs=62 Hz), and the amplitude is higher than the healthy

excitation, noise and other signals, and the modula tion will disappear in the low-frequency range, 
which has a great impact on fault diagnosis. Ther efore, we use the Teager‚ÄìKaiser energy operator 
method to demodulate the potential low-frequency broken-tooth fault frequency modulated into the 
high-frequency region. The result is shown in Figure 10. It can be seen from Figure 10 that there are 
peaks at the local fault characteristic frequency of the sun wheel ( nfs/3), the absolute rotation 
frequency of the sun wheel ( mfa), and the absolute rotation frequency ( kfc) of the planet carrier (such 
as 5fc = 7.5Hz, 8 fc = 12 Hz, 2 fa = 13.5 Hz, 5 fa = 33.5 Hz, 2 fs = 42 Hz, and 3 fs = 62 Hz), and the amplitude is 
higher than the healthy signal. There are a large number of side bands around the above frequency 
positions, and most of the peaks are located at the combination of planetary frame rotating frequency 
and local fault characteristic frequency of the solar wheel [70] (such as fs ‚àí 3fc = 16.5 Hz,  fs + fc = 22.5 Hz 
and fs + 3fc = 23 Hz near 12 fc). The presence of 2 fs ‚àí 2fc = 39 Hz, 4 fs/3 + 14 fc = 48 Hz and 2 fs + 5fc = 49 Hz 
near 2 fs further illustrates the existence of the local fa ult of the solar wheel, an d they also prove the

direction by the energy operator. 
4. Conclusion 
We propose a new method for planetary gearbox fault detection based on compressed sensing, 
2D-VMD and full-vector spectrum theo ry. The conclusions are as follows: 
1. In view of the complexity and low signal-to-no ise ratio of the vibration signal extracted from 
the multi-stage planetary gearbox, compressed sensin g is used to denoise the signal, which proves 
that compressed sensing has strong robustness and noise reduction ability for noise signals. 
2. In order to realize the synchronous noise re duction of multi-degree-of-freedom signals, we 
propose a new idea of multi-sens or data fusion, which extends one-dimensional variational mode 
decomposition to multi-dimensional. The 2D-VMD method with non-recursive mode and strong mathematical theory is used to process the planet ary gearbox fault signal, and R√©nyi entropy is used 
to be the optimization index of 2D-VMD performance by measuring the coupling degree of 
information, so as to extract the fault features co ntained in the effective target IMF component, and 
the feasibility of the method is proved by analyz ing and showing the fault characteristic frequency 
of the solar wheel in the planetary gearbox. The proposed method realizes the synchronous 
processing of multivariate vibration signals and can efficiently and comprehensively extract the effective spectrum characteristics of planetary gearbox fault state signals. 
3. Using the full-vector spectrum technique, th e homologous information collected by multiple 
sensors is data layer fused in the spatial do main and the time domain to increase the 
comprehensiveness and certaint y of the fault information.

vibration signals and can e ciently and comprehensively extract the e ective spectrum characteristics
of planetary gearbox fault state signals.
3. Using the full-vector spectrum technique, the homologous information collected by multiple
sensors is data layer fused in the spatial domain and the time domain to increase the comprehensiveness
and certainty of the fault information.
4. When the multi-stage planetary gearbox is in the state of broken teeth, there are peak values at
the meshing frequency, at its doubling frequency, and at k fmm fc(mn)fs/3, and the side frequency
band is formed at the same time, while the width and amplitude are greater than the healthy signal.
Potential low-frequency features need to be demodulated from the high-frequency domain using energy
operators, and the energy operator has higher resolution than envelope demodulation. When the
multi-stage planetary gearbox is in local fault, the peak values will appear at the frequency multiplication
(nfs/3) of the sun wheel‚Äôs local fault characteristic frequency, at the frequency multiplication ( mfc) of the
planet carrier‚Äôs absolute rotation frequency, and at the frequency multiplication ( kfa) of the sun wheel‚Äôs
absolute rotation frequency; the peak values appear at the combined position of the three and form the
side band at the same time.
