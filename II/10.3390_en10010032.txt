Abstract: Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of critical subassemblies can provide an advanced
maintenance strategy for wind turbines installed in remote regions. This paper proposes a novel
prognostic approach to predict the RUL of bearings in a wind turbine gearbox. An artiﬁcial neural
network (NN) is used to train data-driven models and to predict short-term tendencies of feature
series. By combining the predicted and training features, a polynomial curve reﬂecting the long-term
degradation process of bearings is ﬁtted. Through solving the intersection between the ﬁtted curve
and the pre-deﬁned threshold, the RUL can be deduced. The presented approach is validated by
an operating wind turbine with a faulty bearing in the gearbox.

1. Introduction
More and more attention is being given to the maintenance of wind turbines installed in remote
regions [ 1–3]. This attention is due to the difﬁculty of transporting and hoisting wind turbine parts.
Conventional methods of replacing failed subassemblies in wind turbines cause long downtimes.
Remaining useful life (RUL) prognostics enable early detection of faultiness and estimation of the
failure time of subassemblies in wind turbines, further helping operators to schedule a reasonable
maintenance plan and save operational costs.
Plenty of approaches have been developed to monitor the health conditions of wind turbines.
Yang et al. [4] utilized electrical signals to discover windings faults in wind turbine generators.
Teng et al. [5] adopted ofﬂine vibration analysis to detect multiple faults in wind turbine gearboxes.
Kusiak and Verma [ 6] analyzed the temperature signals from the supervisory control and data
acquisition system to predict bearing faults in generators. Dupuis [ 7] used oil debris to monitor
wind turbine gearboxes and provide an early indication of internal damage to bearings and gears.
Strain gauges and acoustic emission were used for fault detection in blades, bearings and shafts [ 8].
Condition monitoring systems are good at ﬁnding defects existing in machinery subassemblies, but
they seldom allow the estimation of the RUL of faulty parts in wind turbines.
Data-driven based approaches are widely applied to estimate the RUL of rotating machineries.
Tian et al. [ 9,10] proposed a neural network (NN) model to predict RUL of pump bearings using
historical failure and suspension data. Ali et al. [ 11] adopted a simpliﬁed fuzzy-adaptive resonance
theory map NN with Weibull distribution to predict the RUL of bearings. Zio et al. [ 12] applied

particle ﬁltering to estimate the RUL of a mechanical component subject to fatigue crack growth.
Chen et al. [ 13] combined adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems and high-order particle ﬁltering
to forecast the RUL of planetary gear plates in a helicopter. Nonlinear feature reduction [ 14] and
exponential regression [ 15] are integrated with a support vector machine to predict the residual useful
life of a bearing. Boskoski et al. [ 16] used Renyi entropy based features and Gaussian process models
to anticipate the RUL of bearings. Sikorska et al. [ 17] summarized the modelling approaches for
predicting the RUL of engineering assets in a real industrial environment.
The majority of the above research focused on predicting the RUL of bearings through training
life cycle models. However, this approach is not suitable for the RUL estimation of wind turbines for
several reasons: (i) multiple gears and bearings in the gearbox make it difﬁcult to acquire the same
failure datasets; e.g., the failure parts may be diverse in the same types of wind turbines from the same
wind farm; (ii) varying operational conditions disturb the degradation process of critical parts [ 18];
and (iii) the degradation tendencies of training dataset do not always accord with the testing dataset,
even for the same type of parts [19].
In this paper, a novel RUL prognostic approach without life cycle training models is proposed
to predict the RUL of bearings in wind turbine gearbox. The remainder of the paper is organized as
follows: the structure of the drive train of wind turbines is presented, and the transmission ratios of
different stages in a gearbox are calculated in Section 2. Section 3 proposes the NN-based prediction
method of short-term feature tendencies and the estimation procedure of the RUL. In Section 4, the
proposed approach is validated by studying an operating wind turbine with a faulty bearing in the
gearbox. Conclusions are drawn in Section 5.
2. Wind T urbine Drive Train
The drive train of mainstream wind turbines shown in Figure 1 consists of a rotor, gearbox and
generator. The rotor connecting with three blades converts wind energy into low speed mechanical
energy which in turn is speeded up by the gearbox. The drive train involves multiple critical parts e.g.,
gears, bearings and shafts. Eight acceleration transducers are installed on the surface of the drive train
to monitor its health condition. Each transducer is responsible for the adjacent parts.

3.2. Procedure of Remaining Useful Life Estimation of Bearings
The prognostic procedure for determining the RUL is shown in Figure 4. First, the acquired
vibration data is analyzed using advanced signal processing methods. Fault frequencies are calculated
based on the structure of the wind turbine gearbox. Then, the potential fault is detected by
comparing the analysis result of signal processing and fault frequencies. Next, the time of early
fault detection is considered as the starting time of the RUL prognostic. The feature indexes reﬂecting
the degradation tendencies of faulty parts are calculated and selected as prognostic objects. Meanwhile,
the threshold of each feature index is set according to statistical analysis or existing criteria. Next,
the short-term tendency of selected feature index is predicted using the NN described in the section
above. A polynomial curve indicating long-term tendency of feature index is ﬁtted on the basis of the
training and predicted features, and the type of ﬁtted curve is determined by observing the shape of
the historical and short-term predicted features. Finally, the RUL is estimated through calculating the
intersection of the ﬁtted curve and pre-deﬁned threshold.

 the historical and short-term predicted features. Fi nally, the RUL is estimated through calculating the 
intersection of the fitted curv e and pre-defined threshold. 
When new vibration data become availabl e, the corresponding feature indexes are 
supplemented into the former training features an d used to estimate the RUL at current time. The 
prognostic process is implemented repe atedly until the faulty part fails.

Given the fitted curve f(t), the RUL of current time is estimated as Equation (8):

where tc is the current time, and 1()T f v−  is the estimated failure time under the fitted tendency curve

In industrial applications, affected by varying amplitude loads and background noise, 
individual features may fluctuate, which leads to an incorrect prognostic result, so multiple features need to be selected to calculate the weighted RUL expressed in Equation (9) to improve the stability

From the 301th (the 75.25th day) to the 380th (t he 95th day) group, there are multi-harmonic 
frequencies of 77 Hz corresponding to the featur e frequency of rolling element in Table 3, which 
reflects a fault arising on rolling balls of the bear ing in the high speed shaft close to the generator. 
From the 381th (the 95.25th day) group to the end in Figure 6, another frequency 243 Hz and its 
harmonics become evident, which indicate a fault on the inner race of the bearing. The same 
frequency also emerges in Figure 7 from th e 600th (the 150th day) group to the end.

The frequencies from the 75.25th day in Figures 6 and 7 demonstrate faults starting to occur on the
bearing in the high speed shaft of the wind turbine gearbox. This time is recognized as the initial time
of estimating the RUL. The faulty bearing in the high speed shaft near the generator, circled in Figure 1,
is one of the most fragile parts in the drive train of wind turbine due to the possible misalignment of
the connection with the generator.
4.3. Prognosis of the Remaining Useful Life of the Faulty Bearing
The faulty bearing in the high speed shaft is near transducer 6 in Figure 1. However, the vibration
amplitude of transducer 5 in Figure 5a is larger than the one of transducer 6 in Figure 5b, and the fault
feature in Figure 6 is more obvious than in Figure 7. These are caused by different mounting positions
of the two transducers. In the gearbox case, the stiffness of the location where transducer 5 is installed
is less than that of the location of transducer 6. According to the vibration criterion VDI 3834 [ 22] for
wind turbine gearboxes, the vibration amplitude of transducer 5 is too large to be a prognostic index.
Therefore, transducer 6 is analyzed and regarded as the prognostic object in this paper.
Eight time features and four frequency features are calculated according to Table 4. Among all
the time features in Figure 8, the root mean square (RMS), variance and square root of amplitude
represent an ascending tendency that can indicate the degradation process of the faulty bearing.
VDI 3834 provides a warning and alarm limit for the drive train of wind turbines based on the
statistics of vibration RMS [ 22], so RMS is selected to be the feature index in RUL estimation since
it has a deterministic threshold. For the vibration signal from the HSS of wind turbine gearbox,
12 m/s2is selected as the failure threshold [ 22]. A fault feature selected in RUL estimation should be
monotonically increasing or decreasing, which represents predictability. For the frequency features in
Figure 9, the spectrum energy of the 3rd frequency band performs better than the other three frequency
features, thus it is regarded as the second prognostic index. When the bearing is normal (from 0
to 75th day), the mean value and standard deviation in the 3rd frequency band are 2.51 and 0.76.
The failure threshold of this feature index is set as 2.51 + 5 0.76 = 6.31. Five is chosen as the multiple
based on statistical theory [23].

According to Equations (8) and (9), the RUL of th e faulty bearing is estimated as in Figure 12

Figure 12b shows the RUL using the 3rd frequency band and Figure 12c shows the final RUL combining the above two features. Figures 6 and 7 indicate that bearing fault arises from the 75th 
day. The features between the 75th day and the 105th  are used to train NN model, so the predicted 
RUL starts from the 105th day in Figure 12. At the beginning of predicted RUL after the 105th day, it is inaccurate since the failure time is far from the prediction starting time. As time goes on, the predicted RUL is approaching the true RUL, which shows a good prognostic result. A safe preparation time t
sp denoted by the dash dot line is defined as a time to prepare spare parts 
appropriately, neither delay the replacement of cr itical parts while failur e happens nor generate 
unnecessary inventory. According to [24], the safety preparation time (critical condition in [24]) 
should be defined uniquely for different critical pa rts. Therefore, considering the transportation and 
replacement time, tsp = 30 day is an applicable option for the maintenance of bearings in wind turbine 
gearbox. In Figure 12c, while the estimated RUL reaches tsp, time pasts 178.15 days, so the true RUL 
is 204.75 − 178.15 = 26.6 days. The pr ognostic accuracy is (30 − 26.6)/26.6 = 12.78%, and it is sufficient 
to guarantee an effective maintenance.

An echo state network is one of the recurrent NNs that can solve any dynamical system with
arbitrary accuracy [ 25]. It uses random recurrent networks to replace the hidden layer in traditional
NNs and make the computation simple. Here, an echo state network is applied to predict the RUL
of the bearings in wind turbine gearboxes. The prognostic procedure is similar to Figure 4, just
substituting the NN by an echo state network to make the short-term tendency prediction. The number

In Figure 14, there are some discrete sections in the estimated RUL. The missing sections are 
caused by the negative solution of the inverse fitti ng curve in Equation (8). That indicates the RUL 
cannot be predicted at those times. In Fi gure 14c, while the estimated RUL reaches tsp, time pasts 178.8 
days, the true RUL is 204.75 − 178.8 = 25.95 days and the prognostic accuracy is (30 − 25.95)/25.95 = 
15.61%. This prediction is accurate enough to sche dule maintenance for the faulty bearing. However, 
compared with the results in Figure 12c, the esti mated RUL using the echo state network in Figure 
14c obviously fluctuates, representing a worse prog nostic effectiveness. Especially after the safe 
preparation time, the estimated RUL gradually diverges from the true one. 
4.4.2. Application of the Presented Approach of Re maining Useful Life Estimation to Experimental 
Dataset 
Experimental datasets from PRONOSTIA [19] are used to further demonstrate the effectiveness 
of the proposed RUL estimation a pproach. Seventeen groups of life cycle vibration data are generated 
in this platform. Two datasets (bearing1_1, bear ing1_3) with obvious increasing tendencies are 
selected to verify the RUL algorithm. Figure 15 sh ow the RMS of the two datasets where 27,470 s and 
22,880 s are set as the failure time s. After those times, bearings enter into a severely damaged state, 
and they may fail at any time. 
Figure 14. The estimated RUL using echo state network: ( a) using RMS of the life cycle vibration
signals; ( b) using the 3rd frequency band; and ( c) combining the above two features.
In Figure 14, there are some discrete sections in the estimated RUL. The missing sections are caused
by the negative solution of the inverse ﬁtting curve in Equation (8). That indicates the RUL cannot be
predicted at those times. In Figure 14c, while the estimated RUL reaches tsp, time pasts 178.8 days, the
true RUL is 204.75  178.8 = 25.95 days and the prognostic accuracy is (30  25.95)/25.95 = 15.61%.
This prediction is accurate enough to schedule maintenance for the faulty bearing. However, compared
with the results in Figure 12c, the estimated RUL using the echo state network in Figure 14c obviously
ﬂuctuates, representing a worse prognostic effectiveness. Especially after the safe preparation time,
the estimated RUL gradually diverges from the true one.
4.4.2. Application of the Presented Approach of Remaining Useful Life Estimation to
Experimental Dataset
Experimental datasets from PRONOSTIA [ 19] are used to further demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed RUL estimation approach. Seventeen groups of life cycle vibration data are generated in
this platform. Two datasets (bearing1_1, bearing1_3) with obvious increasing tendencies are selected
to verify the RUL algorithm. Figure 15 show the RMS of the two datasets where 27,470 s and 22,880 s

5. Conclusions 
RUL prognostic of critical subassemblies plays a significant role in the predictive maintenance 
of wind turbines. However, it is challenging due to the diversity of failures, the difficulty in extracting 
fault feature, and the instability of long-term predictions, etc. 
The RUL estimation of the faulty bearings in wind turbine gearboxes in this paper involves fault 
diagnostics and RUL prognostics. Using analysis of  the frequency spectrum, bearing faults can be 
distinctly detected and the start-point of RUL es timation can be determined. The RUL prognostic 
approach fuses NN-based short-term tendency prediction and polynomial fitting-based long-term 
tendency estimation. 
Short-term prediction in RUL prognostics makes the fitted long-term tendency more practicable 
than the fitted result from pure historical features. Time and frequency features are individually selected to estimate the RUL of the bearings in wi nd turbine gearboxes. To overcome the fluctuation 
of individual features caused by varying amplitude loads, the time and frequency features are combined to obtain more accura te prognostic results than those available from the individual 
features. A safe preparation time is estimated with  an acceptable error of 12.78%, which can benefit 
scheduling a reliable maintenance strategy for the bearings in wind turbine gearboxes.
