Abstract.  As an renewable and clean energy of the world, wind energy has gained more and more 
attention and its fault diagnosis becomes more a nd more important. The gearbox, as the kernel 
component of the wind turbine system, it’s robust conditions have a great influence on the whole wind turbines system. Wind turbine gearbox has complex structure, which is usually composed of 
solar planetary gearbox and cylindrical gearbox. In the process of operation, various kinds of faults 
easily occur, resulting in serious losses. Once th e wind turbine gearbox is not functioning as 
smoothly as it could be, it may result in large economic losses for the company and owner. At the 
same time, the failure rate of wi nd turbine gearbox has always be en high because of complicated 
mechanic structure and special motion. Theref ore, the tasks of reducing the downtime and 
increasing the productivity of wind turbine gearbox are urgent. This paper reviewed some research 
results of faults diagnosis on wind turbines gearbox, such as time-frequency analysis method, 
vibration based methods, nondestructive testing methods, etc. Meanwhile, this paper finds out 
some key problems and the channel of the resolution of the issue in order to supply some 
information for the further research of wind turbines gearbox. 
Keywords: wind turbine gearbox, fault diagnosis, feature extraction, condition monitoring. 
1. Introduction 
Wind harvesting via wind turbines has been growing explosively in recent years [1], which 
plays an important role in optimizing energy structure. For investors, the main aim of wind 
turbines is creating the maximum economic benefits . Therefore, this need wind turbine can meet 
the requirements of more yield power and less down time. That is to say, the research aims are 
increasing productivity and reducing operating costs. But, various failures of wind turbine become 
a powerful resistance factor to achieve the goal  [2]. The most of wind turbines have been 
established in the remote areas,  such as offshore and no man’s land, because these areas have 
abundant wind source. These work places of wind turbines don’t conducive to perform operational 
and maintenance works to some extent. It is es timated that the operational and maintenance costs 
of wind turbines account for abou t 25 %-30 % of costs or 75 %-90 % of the investment costs for 
a wind turbine of 20-years life cy cle [3, 4]. At the other hand, as 2MW-type turbines appears in 
2002, it reveals that the future trend is large-scale wind turbines. Compared with 750 KW 
machines, the operations and maintenance costs of 2 MW-type wind turbine might be decreased 12 % [2]. But, it remains challenging to keep no rmal running so as to minimize operational and 
maintenance costs and maximize productivity. 
The typical faults in wind turbines generally fall into six categories: blade faults, gearbox  
faults, generator faults, bearing faults, mechani cal braking system faults and pitch-controlled 
system faults. It is worth mentioning, because of running in poor working conditions in long time and complex structure, wind turbines gearbox fault diagnosis have been a significant challenge, 
especially decreasing fault freque ncy and downtime. More specifically, as the core component of 
wind turbine system, gearbox not only investment cost occupies large proportion in total

failure rate based on statistical failure data of  components. The detail failure rate and downtime 
as shown in Fig. 1 [5]. 
 
Fig. 1.  Wind turbines subassembly failure rates, downtime and failure types 
As can be seen form Fig. 1, the mean annual downtime of minor and major failures of gearbox 
up to 60 days, which seriously influences the productivity and efficiency of wind turbines. The 
picture also shows that maintenance works of wind turbines gearbox need 18.38 days to finish it 
which is in the second for per failure due to their size and robust link to other components making it harder to access, repair, or even replace [6]. Such long maintenance time and according another 
research [7-9] can fully illustrates above opinion that it is hard to repair the faults of wind turbine 
gearbox in the wind field. Moreov er, the expected operation life of  gearbox is usually publicized 
as 20 years from merchant. However, the true service life of gearbox can only reach six to eight 
years [5], which not only extra increases cost of  wind turbines, but also  decrease the production 
efficiency. In order to decrease produce and repair cost of wind turbines, di rect-drive wind turbines 
are utilized to avoid the failures of gearbox so as to minimize maintenance cost [10]. This practice 
did not achieve the ideal results, the total failure rate of the electronic comp onents in direct-drive 
wind turbines is 33 % higher than that of the gearboxes in indirect-drive wind turbines, especially the failure rate of large direct-driven wind turbines is up to double [11]. What’s more, the share 
of global wind turbines installations accounted for by gearbox-based wind turbines is 74 %, and 
it shows that gearbox-based wind turbines have enormous advantages compared with direct-drive 
wind turbines [12]. So, fault diagnosis of wind turbines gearbox is an essential part in the process 
of development of wind turbines in the further [13, 14]. The problem that provide the mature technology to largely reduces downtime and avoid catastrophic incidents need to be solved 
urgently [15]. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the different components of wind turbines 
gearbox in order to detect the faults that may happen, and then some pr esent comparison methods 
can be used in diagnosing the faults when facing different faults that happen in gearbox. 
The organization of the paper is as follows: S ection 1 presents the main structure of some 
typical wind turbines gearbox. The second part mainly completes the main structure analysis of the gearbox of wind turbine, and what faults will happen to the gearbox of wind turbine, and what

gearbox introduces. Section 4 analyzed the structure healthy condition monitoring (SHCM) methods according to turbine faults’ categori es. Section 5 analyzed the advantages and 
disadvantages in the nowadays fault diagnosis (FD) methods. Some conclusions are given in the 
last section. 
2. Typical faults in wind turbines gearbox 
From the transmission principle of the wind turbin e, it can be seen that the speed of the blade 
does not match the rated speed of the generator. Th erefore, the transmission of wind power to the 
generator is used to achieve the corresponding in put speed. At present, in many commercial wind 
turbine systems, fixed transmission ratio gearbox is used to connect turbine rotor and generator. 
A variable ratio gearbox (VRG) allows wind turbine, with a constant-speed generator, to discretely 
vary rotor speed and to achieve greater aerodynam ic efficiency [16]. Generally, the gearbox is 
designed as sun and planetary gear with parallel gear structure to obtain optimum input speed and 
transmission ratio. The most common wind turbine gearboxes have one or two planetary gear stages and two or one parallel stage [17]. The st ructure of the 1.5MW-type  wind turbine gearbox 
as shown in Fig. 2 [18]. 
 
Fig. 2.  The structure of the 1.5 MW-type wind turbine gearbox 
As can be seen from Fig. 2, the internal struct ure of the wind turbine g earbox is quite complex. 
Once the components fail, the whole system will no t work properly because of chain reaction. In 
addition, wind turbines have long been under severe conditions such as heavy load, gust and dust 
corrosion, which makes the gearbox of wind turbines  prone to failure. The faults in wind turbines 
gearbox can be classified into two categories: wear-out failures and temporary random faults [12]. One step further, the detail faults of wind turbines gearbox can be described as gear damage, 
bearing damage, broken shaft, leaking oil and high oil temperature, and poor lubrication, etc.  
[2, 19, 20].  
2.1. Typical blade faults  
For some reasons, wind turbines work directly in the wind, rain, snow and other harsh 
environments. The diameter of wind turbine blades becomes bigger and bigger in order to capture 
more wind energy. This makes it easy to lead to so me faults directly on the blades, such as the 
rotor imbalance, blades and hub corrosion, crack, and serious aeroelastic deflections in large wind 
turbines [21].

 ISSN  PRINT 1392-8716,  ISSN  ONLINE 2538-8460,  KAUNAS , LITHUANIA  29 2.2. Typical gearbox faults  
The main function of gearbox is to transmit wind power into the generator to reach the 
corresponding input speed. Currently, most of the co mmercially available wind turbines have been 
operated using a fixed-gear ratio between the turbine rotor and electrical generator. A variable ratio gearbox (VRG) allows wind turbine, with a co nstant-speed generator, to discretely vary rotor 
speed and to achieve greater aerod ynamic efficiency [22, 23]. In order to obtain higher input speed 
and transmission ratio, the gearbox is commonly designed as sun and planetary gear with parallel gear structure. Because of the longtime running in poor working conditions such as heavy load, 
wind gust or dust corrosion, failures of the wind turbine gearbox are various, such as shaft 
imbalance, shaft misalignment, shaft damage, bearing damage, gear damage, broken shaft, leaking oil, high oil temperature, a nd poor lubrication, etc.  
2.3. Typical generator faults  
Generator can transform mechanical energy into electricity energy directly. There are kinds of 
generator from the structure side, such as cage induction generator, brushless doubly-fed  
generator, Alternating Current (AC) excited generato r, synchronous generator, etc. In these types, 
double-fed asynchronous motors are commonly used by most generator manufacturers. Generator’s long-term operation in the electr omagnetic environment may cause some common 
failures as follows [24]: generator excessive vibration, generator overheating, bearing overheating, 
abnormal noises and insulation damage, etc.  
2.4. Typical bearing faults  
Bearings are essential co mponents of wind turbines as in other rotation machines, especially 
in generators and gearboxes. Dynamic and unpredictable stress may cause premature wear in 
bearing, which will lead to the in crease of maintenance cost, even lead to sudden expensive turbine 
breakdowns. Overheating is another typical fault in wind turbine bearings, and can impact the performance of running turbine bearings [2].  
2.5. Mechanical braking system faults  
The mechanical brake is generally applied after the blade furling and electromagnetic braking 
(where fifitted) have reduced the shaft speed. Ot herwise, if lacking the mechanical brake, the 
component would rapidly be worn down if it is directly used to brake the turbine from full speed. 
In most wind turbine countries, wind turbines are required by law to obtain two independent fail 
safe brake mechanisms to stop the turbine promptly when required. On the other hand, failures 
within the braking process, fo r example when the speed exceeds the limit, can cause serious 
damages to the main structure, especially the mechanical units and blades. Failures within the 
hydraulic unit will also result in the brakes remaining on and increase the downtime [2].  
2.6. Pitch-controlled system faults  
The number of faults occurred in pitch-contro lled system of wind turbine just follows the 
electrical system. It also  account for a large proportions of the longest machine halt time in parts 
and single failure longest downtime. Moreover, due to complexity and ambiguity, it is difficult to 
describe relationships between mechanism and faults  caused by mathematical models in the pitch 
controlled system [2]. 
The cost distribution over the different failure modes for a wind turbine gearbox population as 
shown to Fig. 3 [25]. To keep a better development of wind turbines, gearbox work w ell has thus become an increasingl y important problem.

3. Difficulties of wind turbine gearbox fault diagnosis  
The gearbox of wind turbine is generally considered to be composed of solar gears, planetary 
gears, gear rings and planetary frames. Compared wi th the fixed-axis rotating gearbox in structure, 
the gearbox of wind turbine is quite different. At  the same time, the motion principle of planetary 
gearbox fixed axis rotating gearbox is determined by its structure in completely different ways. 
Usually, the ring gear is fixed, the sun gear revolves around its own central axis, and the planetary 
gear not only revolves around its own central axis, but also revolves around the central axis of the sun gear, meshing with the sun gear and the ring  gear. Complex motion characteristics help to 
generate vibration signals, including characteristic  frequencies of differen t components, vibration 
coupling elements of power  input and load equipment, and no ise interference elements. At the 
same time, the difficulties of fault diagnosis of wind turbine gearbox are as follows.  
The arrangement of sensors is limited by the comp act structure of wind turbine room. In the 
process of signal acquisition, ma ny effective means are used to  collect and transmit vibration 
signals. That is to say, different sensors are used  according to the test ta rget, such as low-speed 
accelerometer to test low-speed axis, and common  accelerometer to test high-speed axis. In 
addition, the complex transmission path of the wind turbine gearbox can attenuate the vibration 
signal and weaken the vibration response of the fault. 
The vibration signal of wind turbines gearbox has the frequency modulation characteristic 
when various frequency components are coupled [26]. So, vibration signal of wind turbines 
gearbox shows the non linear characteristic. 
Generally speaking, when we collect vibration si gnals, the acceleration sensor is installed in 
the fixed position of the planetary gearbox of the wind turbine. The relative distance between 
accelerometers and the meshing position between sola r gear and planetary gear, planetary gear 
and gear ring are time-varying, which causes th e change of vibration transmission path. This 
phenomenon is called amplitude modulation. Therefore, the vibration signal of fan gearbox 
presents AM phenomenon, showing non-stationary characteristics, which in creases the difficulty 
of fault diagnosis of fan gearbox [27]. Meanwhile, the varying loads of wind turbines contribute to intensify this characteristic, especially large- scale varying loads when the wind turbine instant 
start. 
The vibration signals of transmission system of wind turbines disturbed by background noise 
is inevitably. Unfortunately, the vibration signal of wind turbines gearbox is polluted by 
low-frequency noise, which make difficult to extract fault feature. 
As can be seen form above difficulties of fault diagnosis of wind turbine gearbox, which 
definitely hinders the development of fault diagnosis of wind turbines gearbox. So, it is important to find an effective method to solve the difficu lties of fault diagnosis of wind turbine gearbox.

 ISSN  PRINT 1392-8716,  ISSN  ONLINE 2538-8460,  KAUNAS , LITHUANIA  31 4. Wind turbine gearbox fault diagnosis methods 
As mentioned above, the operation and maintenance cost of wind turbine gearbox occupies a 
large proportion in the whole wind turbine system, an d the fault of wind turbine gearbox is difficult 
to diagnose. Therefore, in order to ensure the no rmal operation of wind turbines, it is necessary to 
establish fault diagnosis methods. In recent years, due to the attention paid by some scholars to 
the fault diagnosis of wind turbine gearbox, many solutions have been put forward and some 
results have been achieved. The results are as follows. 
4.1. Time-frequency analysis methods 
Vibration analysis is an effective method for fault diagnosis of transmission chain system of 
wind turbines and has been widely used. However, due to the above difficulties in fault diagnosis of wind turbine gearbox, it is difficult to accurately diagnose planetary gearbox faults. 
Faced these difficulties, many scholars have co nducted a series of st udies in recent years. 
Wenyi Liu reviewed the noise mechanism and de-noi sing techniques in wind turbines of the recent 
years [28], he also put forward a multi-dimensio nal kernel domain spectrum (MD-KDS) method 
to conduct intelligent wind generator fault de tection [29]. A time-frequency analysis based on 
Vold-Kalman filter and higher order energy se paration for fault diagnosis of wind turbine 
planetary gearbox under nonstationary conditions was proposed by Zhipeng Feng [30]. Feng also 
introduced adaptive optimal kernel time- frequenc y analysis method to deal with wind turbine 
planetary gearbox fault under non-stationary conditions [31, 32]. In order to resolve time-varying gear fault features, Feng also co nduct an Time-Frequency emodul ation analysis via Vold-Kalman 
filter for wind turbine planetary gearbox fau lt diagnosis under nonstationary speeds and the 
proposed time-frequency analysis method is furt her extended to generate time-varying amplitude 
and frequency demodulated spectra [23]. A novel order tracking method based on discrete 
spectrum correction technique is proposed by Guolin He to analyze wind turbine gearbox vibration 
for the purposes of health monitoring and fault diagnosis [18]. Zhixiong Li used a supervised 
bounded component analysis method to detect gear cracks in a complex gearbox of wind turbines 
[33]. Bingchang Hou provided a novel tacholess order tracking method based on generalized 
demodulation (GD) for WT fault detection. A multi-ch annel sensor system is applied in the signal 
acquisition to solve issues relating to its installa tion position and direction of a single sensor. A 
new filtering algorithm based on the meshing resonance phenomenon is proposed by Tianyang 
Wang [34]. Aiming to extract the fault feature of  planet gear effectively, Yun Kong propose a 
novel feature extraction method based on spectral kurtosis and time wavelet energy spectrum [35]. 
Jinjiang Wang presented a fault component separation method that integrates ensemble empirical mode decomposition with independent component analysis to address the problem of low 
signal-to-noise ratio [36]. Multi-fault detection ha s been a challengeable task for fault feature 
extraction, to address it, Wei Teng introduced a multi-fault detection and failure analysis method 
based on complex wavelet transform [37]. Zhaohui Du also presented sparse feature identification 
method based on union of redundant dictionary to deal with wind turbine gearbox multi-fault 
conditions [38]. In order to addressed the cha llenging issue that under-determined blind source 
separation (BSS) of nonlinear mixed signals in mu ltiple-fault detection of wind turbine gearbox, 
Yang Qian presented a solution through a combination of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) 
and kernel independent component analysis (KICA) methods [39]. Aijun Hu proposed approach based on ensemble intrinsic time-scale decomposition and Wigner bi-spectrum entropy to extract 
the fault features and recognize th e gearbox fault types when two or  more fault features are close 
to each other [40]. Aimed at the planetary gearbox  early failure detection, Liu Hong introduced 
Fourier series analysis is and robust feature extr action algorithms [41]. Ma Zhiyong also presented 
the multi-scale enveloping spectrogram method to detect weak faults [42]. Labar Hocine used 
wind turbine gearbox fault diagnosis method based on symmetrical components and frequency domain [43]. Yingning Qiu presented a first attempt to use Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence

procedure of multi-dimensional information fusion for WT fault diagnosis [44]. To solve the problem of the traditional fault detection method s which are based on constant operating speed 
assumption will be invalid in a complex situation, Bingchang Hou provided a novel tacholess 
order tracking method based on generalized demodulation (GD) for WT fault detection [45]. While using the novel modulation model  to support the fault diagnosis of th e planetary stage of a 
wind turbine gearbox, the fault f eature of planetary stage with lower rotational speed is easily 
concealed by the meshing vibratio n energy of ordinary stages with  higher speed, to resolve this 
problem ,Wei Teng submit it is effective to utili ze empirical wavelet transform to adaptively find 
weak fault frequency in planetary stage as well as evident fault characteristics in other ordinary stages [46]. Wei Teng also proposed a tunable Q-factor wavelet transform based sparse 
representation method is proposed, which integrates  the property of tunable Q wavelet transform, 
non-convex penalty and noise optimization into  sparse decomposition [47]. Stephan Schmidt 
claimed a new method, referred to as the IFBI agram, which can be capable of identifying 
frequency bands that are rich with diagnostic in formation related to specific cyclic components. 
This allows the optimal frequency band to be de termined for diagnosing the component-of-interest 
[48].  
The basic idea of these methods is  to process the signals collect ed by the vibration acceleration 
sensor, and the signal processing method is introduced. Therefore, the quality of signal processing methods directly affects the anal ysis results. Moreover, the field conditions of wind farms are 
complex, and some time-frequency analysis method s are not necessarily applicable to the actual 
situation of all wind farms. In  another word, each method will achieve better results under its 
specific conditions, but it is not a panacea, in some environmental conditions change, these methods may not be significant or ineffective. 
4.2. The CMS performance methods 
The main function of condition monitoring system (CMS) is to predict some fault modes and 
apply it to the gearbox of wind turbine. It must also be pointed out that CMS cannot predict every 
potential failure mode, so costly error alerts may occur. 
So far, researchers have made important contributions to the performance of CMS. Yang 
Wenxian summarized the technical methods of condition monitoring for wind turbine [49]. 
I. Antoniadou introduced a time-frequency an alysis approach to deals with the condition 
monitoring of wind turbine gearboxes under varying operating conditions [50]. Joel Igba 
developed novel techniques for fault detection using the RMS and Extreme (peak) values of 
vibration signals [51]. Abdulwahed Salem adopted order analysis method to avoid any catastrophic failure to the gearbox and maintain  system reliability [52]. Jong M. Ha propose 
autocorrelation-based time synchro nous averaging (ATSA) to cope w ith the challenges associated 
with the current practice of time synchronous av eraging (TSA) for planet gears in planetary 
gearboxes of wind turbine [53]. Huageng Luo presented approaches in vibration-based wind 
turbine gearbox condition monitoring. Detailed spectral analys is and acceleration enveloping 
techniques were used to effectively extract the gear and bearing damage features. Synchronous analysis was used to accurately detect specifi c damage features during constantly varying 
operational conditions [54]. Feng Yong-xin presented a practical CM technique based on vibration 
analysis for faulty gear and faulty bearing detection of wind turbine gearbox [55]. Shuangwen Sheng presented first-hand oil and wear debris an alysis results obtained through tests that were 
based on full-scale wind turbine gearboxes [56]. Qian Peng presented a single hidden-layer feed 
forward neural network (SLFN), trained using an extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm, for condition monitoring of wind turbines [57]. Salem introduced an improved technique to monitor 
the condition of the wind turbine gearbox based on gearbox vibration and shaft torque signatures 
analyses [58]. With the development of condition monitoring technology, the data collected by 
sensors are voluminous and much fa ster than before, Peng Qian proposed a novel wind turbine

 ISSN  PRINT 1392-8716,  ISSN  ONLINE 2538-8460,  KAUNAS , LITHUANIA  33 condition monitoring method based on cloud computing. This method is not only able to detect 
the faults effectively, but also consider data upload quantity reduction and data security, the case 
proved it is effective and can al so enhance economic benefit and operating efficiency of the wind 
farm. However, it needs to transfer a lot of da ta which relies on the support of high-speed 
information transmission technology [59]. Aimed at the problem that the signal data of wind turbine faulty gearbox is difficult to obtain and the health condition is difficult to diagnose under 
variable working conditions, He Ren and Wenyi Liu came up with a fault diagnosis method based 
on variational mode decomposition (VMD) multi-scale permutation entropy (MPE) and feature 
based transfer learning (FTL) [6 0]. In practice of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis, the 
collected health condition signals are very similar and contain a lot of noise, which makes the fault 
diagnosis of WTs more challenging. In order to handle this problem, Xiaoyin Nie approached a 
model called denoising stacked feature enhanced autoencoder with dynamic feature enhanced 
factor (DSFEAE-DF) [61]. The basi c idea of these methods is to synthetically consider the field 
analysis data of wind farms, and introduce the data processing method to analyze the results from 
the monitoring data including vibration data. 
The main function of CMS system in supervis ory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data 
is to predict the possible failures. The system is shown in Fig. 4 below. As shown in Fig. 4, the 
whole system is composed of training module, prediction module, anomaly detection module, 
fuzzy expert initialization module and fuzzy expert application module. At first the data collected 
are preprocessed according to the suitable methodolo gy. Then in this system the normal behavior 
is trained before the diagnosis. Diagnosis and cl assification results are at  last obtained after the 
testing processing. Based on the application of ANN for condition monitoring in wind turbines, Bangalore presented methods for filtering of data , which ensure that the ANN models are trained 
on the data representing the true normal operating conditions of the wind turbine [62]. Issa Al-Tubi 
investigated the probabilistic risk of gear tooth flank micro-pitting in wind turbine gearboxes and 
shows how relatively slow rate of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data, 
recorded during operation, can be used to an alyze the onset of gear surface damage [63]. A 
monitoring the health method of wind turbine gearboxes based on the lubricant pressure data in the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisitio n (SCADA) system was investigated by  
Long Wang [64].

the field), hardware that can simulate brain function and its necessary external devices, physical devices and software supporting these hardware . At present, the theories and methods of 
intelligent diagnosis applied in wind turbine gear box are mainly based on neural network, fuzzy 
logic, and information fusion. With the development of computer technology, more and more intelligent fault detection technologies are applied to  the fault diagnosis of wind turbines gearbox. 
In the last few year, many scholars have put forward some advanced and reliable methods. 
Silvio Simani and Cihan Turhan advanced a data driven approach that is based on neural networks 
and is used to implement the fault diagnosis block.  This method relies on neural networks that are 
used to describe the strongly nonlinear relationships between measurement and faults. However, the verification and the validation of the proposed solutions by means of da ta acquired from real 
installations and for fault tolerant control applicati ons are failed to conduct in-depth research [65]. 
Mingzhu Tang was devoted to the application of an adaptive LightGBM method for wind turbine fault detections. He developed an improved LightGBM fault detection approach, then a fault 
detection strategy for wind turbine gearboxes was investigated [66]. Given that the installed wind 
capacity grows, the volume of CM data increases, making manual interpretation of vibration signals challenging. Faced this, Sofifia Koukoura proposed an automated framework for gearbox 
incipient failure diagnosis. The framework utilis es vibration signals and performs health 
estimation and fault isolation based on signal proc essing and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. 
Studies have shown that this research can be us ed to optimise wind turbine maintenance actions 
[67]. As the traditional softmax loss of an LSTM network usually lacks the power of 
discrimination, Aijun Yin proposed a fault diagnosis method for wind turbine gearboxes based on optimized LSTM neural networks with cosine loss (Cos-LSTM). The loss can be converted from 
Euclid space to angular space by cosine loss, thus  eliminating the effect of signal strength and 
improve the diagnosis accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified with the 
fault vibration data collected on a gearbox fault diagnosis experimental platform [68]. When 
working in practical engineering applications, the operating states of wind  turbine are various, 
accompanied by a large number of  noise interference, which l eads to the decline of the 
discrimination accuracy of intellig ent diagnosis. In order to addr ess this issue,  Yuanhong Chang 
proposed a concurrent convolution neural network (CeCNN), the raw data is fed into the network 
without any prior knowledge, and the characteristics are learned di rectly and adaptively from the 
input [69]. To tackle the problem of directly applying the traditional algorithms which will cause 
significant degradation of performance by changing working loads of machines, Jianwen Guo presented a novel domain adaptation method, named generative transfer learning (GTL) [70]. 
Wenfeng Hu put forward a wind turbine intelligent fault diagnosis algorithm based on a wavelet 
packet transform (WPT) filter and a cross-validat ed particle swarm optimized (CPSO) kernel 
extreme learning machine (KELM) [71]. In fault detection studies, fuzzy inference can hardly 
detect early faults or measure fault severities due to the singleton input and the limited linguistic 
terms and rules. To work out this issue, Fuming  Qu presented a WT fault detection method based 
on expanded linguistic terms and rules using non-singleton fuzzy logic. He used the generated 
fuzzy inputs, non-singleton fuzzy inference system  (FIS) can be applied in WT fault detection. 
Then he proposed a mechanism of expanding linguistic terms and rules, so that the expanded terms and rules can provide more fault information and he lp to detect early faults [72]. Yonghao Miao 
introduced the encoder signal for th e fault diagnosis of wind turbine gear and presented a novel 
adaptive filtering method, improved maximum correlated kurtosis deconvolution adjusted (IMCKDA), in order to eliminate the diverse noises in encoder signal. Additionally, to overcome

A REVIEW ON WIND TURBINES GEARBOX FAULT DIAGNOSIS METHODS .  
H. GU, W. Y. LIU, Q. W. GAO, Y. ZHANG  
 ISSN  PRINT 1392-8716,  ISSN  ONLINE 2538-8460,  KAUNAS , LITHUANIA  35 operational data collected from the SCADA system and the comparison results show that the GPC 
method is able to prov ide more accurate fault diagnosis result s than the SVM technique on average 
[74]. To addressed the voluntary abnormalities of  various types and loca tions, Azzeddine Bakdi 
presented a data-driven algorithm for online detection of component and system faults in modern 
wind turbines at different operating zones [75]. The traditional time-frequency analysis technology is insufficient in the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of wind turbines. 
Therefore, Zhe Wu proposed a new method of planetary gearbox fault diagnosis based on 
Compressive sensing, Two-dimensional variational mode decomposition (2D-VMD) and full-
vector spectrum technology [76]. 
Intelligent fault diagnosis is one of the frontier di sciplines in the field of fault diagnosis, which 
is developed on the basis of computer and artificial intelligence. These methods have promoted 
the development of wind turbine fault diagnosis technology to some extent. The advantages of 
neural network include parallel structure and parallel processing mode, high self-adaptability, 
strong self-learning ability, and strong fault toleran ce. The merits of fuzzy logic are close to the 
human way of thinking and its results are practi cal. Data fusion improves the effectiveness and 
success rate of fault detection through informa tion complementary, it can overcome the problems 
of uncertainty and low accuracy in fault recognition, and also overcome the complexity of 
environmental noise and external complicated excita tion [76]. But at the same time, there are also 
some shortcoming, such as the disadvantages of neural network are as follows: its training time is 
not controlled, the dynamic system cannot be processed, and the reasoning explanation cannot be 
given by oneself. The drawbacks of fuzzy logic including difficulty to acquire fuzzy diagnostic 
knowledge, dependence on fuzzy knowledge base and the lack of learning ability. While The most serious problem of date fusion is the synchronous processing of massive monitoring data [76]. 
4.4. Other methods for gearbox faults 
Time-frequency method, CMS method and inte lligent fault diagnosis method provide an 
effective way to reduce downtime and operation and maintenance costs. However, due to the influence of variable speed and variable load operation conditions, the traditional methods still 
have some shortcomings in the control of wind tu rbines and there are also some limitations in the 
intelligent fault diagnosis. 
With the development of fault diagnosis technology, more and more scholars have worked out 
other effective methods and applied them to the fault detection of wind turbine gearbox. Juan proposed an experimental study on the application of acoustic emission technology in the health 
diagnosis of wind turbine gearbox [77]. Fangzhou Cheng proposed a new generator stator 
current-based fault diagnostic method for the gearboxes in doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbines under varying rotating speed conditions [78]. Lu Dingguo proposed 
for the fault detection of the gearbox loading conditions [79]. M. Grujicic demonstrated the use of 
the finite element analysis in modeling and elucid ating the root cause of one of the gear failure 
modes (i.e. tooth bending fatigue) under a variety of normal operating and extreme wind ‐loading 
conditions [80]. Bin Gao developed a physics-ba sed multi-dimensional sp atial-transient-stage 
tensor model to describe the thermo optical fl ow (TOF) pattern for evaluating contact fatigue 
damage [81]. To addressed the problems of spectral structure complexity and insensitive to the AM effect, Jae Yoon presented a method using a single piezoelectric strain sensor for wind 
turbines planetary gearboxes fault diagnosis [14]. Jae Yoon also presented a method using a single 
vibration sensor for wind turbines planetary gearboxes fault diagnosis using spectral averaging, which combines the techniques of enveloping, Welch’s spectral averaging, and data mining-based 
fault classifiers [82]. Joel Igba presented a system atic literature review of the current approaches 
of performance assessment, such as reliability and maintainability analysis of wind turbine 
gearboxes with a focus on the use of in-service data [13]. Jeremy Sheldon summarized algorithms 
and results and some conclusions and recommendations are provided that may help guide future 
tests and analysis efforts [83]. Yashwant Sinha discussed about industrial Wind Turbine Gearbox

oil [84]. F. Vanhollebeke used a combination of  multi-body modelling and typical transfer path 
analysis (TPA) to investigate the impact of bear ings on the total transfer path and the resulting 
vibration levels [85]. This method offered great assist on sensor. Xiang Dong analyzed the 
influence of these two parameters of mean wind speed and turbulence intensity on wind turbine gearbox’s fatigue life [86]. Aimed at the AE si gnals did not achieve id eal effect for complex 
structures, Wenxiu Lu used acoustic emission signals to detect planet gear fault localization for 
wind turbine gearbox [87]. In order to learn robust and discriminative fault feature representations 
through a deep network architecture for diagnosis accuracy improvement, Jiang Guoqian proposed 
a novel feature representation learning approach, named stacked multilevel-denoising autoencoders (SMLDAEs) [88]. To accurately detect the faults and analyze the fault signal transfer 
mechanism of planetary gearboxes, Huang Wentao proposed a novel method based on power flow 
finite element to study transfer paths [89]. Helsen  Jan used experiment to investigate the bearing 
slip in a wind turbine gearbox during a transient grid loss event [90]. Considering both the meshing 
vibrations of the planet-ring and planet-sun gear pairs, Guolin He developed a mathematical model 
to analyse the planetary gear train's vibration response [91]. Aimed at the non-stationary and nonlinear characteristics of wind turbine vibration signals, Q. W. Gao presented a fault diagnosis 
method based on integral IELMD multiscale entropy and LSSVM [92].Vamsi Inturi proposed a 
method by using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) which integrated vibration analysis and acoustic signal analysis to diagnose the gear faults  [93]. The changes in th e features of hardware 
sensor measurements, which are used in current SCADA systems, usually cannot provide reliable 
early alarms. In order to resolve this problem, Sikai Zhang a novel dynamic model sensor method is proposed for the SCADA data based wind turbine fault detection [94]. In order to eliminate the 
noise interference and extract th e characteristics of the weak fault, Zhijian Wang provided a new 
method based on MED-LMD for the extraction of multiple faults and weak features in strong 
background noise [95]. Based on the application of high-power wind turbine gearbox, Le Zhang 
designed a three-coil induction abrasive particle  sensor [96]. To detect gearbox fault early, 
Huanguo Chen proposed a method for an effective fault diagnosis by using improved ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and Hilber t square demodulation (HSD) [97]. Hongsheng 
Su established a new stochastic differential equati on model of gearbox state transition to maximize 
the utilization of gearboxes. This model divides the state of the gearbox into two parts: internal 
degradation and external random interference. Weibull distribution and polynomial approximation 
were used to construct the internal degradation model of the gearbox. The external random interference is simulated by Brownian motion. On the basis of the analysis of monitoring data, the 
parameters of the gearbox state model were solved using the Newton Raphson iterative method 
and entropy method [98]. Le Zhang designed a three-coil induction abrasive particle sensor based on the application of high-power wind turbine gearbox [96]. To improve SSC s performance, 
Chuang Sun developed a composite-graph based SSC method (CG-SSC) by introducing distance 
among the data points into SSC, where the L1 norm  of the sparse coefficients is replaced by the 
product of the data distance and the sparse coefficients [99]. The complexity of many 
contemporary techniques is an inhibitor to autonomous fault detection and monitoring of 
non-stationary systems, to slove this issue, Stanley Fong presented a non-parametric, blind spectral pre-processing approach to simultaneously de-noise and extract harmonic content from 
nonstationary vibration signals [100]. 
Some of these monitoring methods start from the output voltage, current and power signals of 
the generator set, some from the mechanical structure, some from  the fusion method, some from 
the vibration and acoustic signals, the main pu rpose is to complete the fault diagnosis and 
maintenance of the wind turbine gearbox.

A REVIEW ON WIND TURBINES GEARBOX FAULT DIAGNOSIS METHODS .  
H. GU, W. Y. LIU, Q. W. GAO, Y. ZHANG  
 ISSN  PRINT 1392-8716,  ISSN  ONLINE 2538-8460,  KAUNAS , LITHUANIA  37 the fault diagnosis methods of wind turbine in r ecent three years, finds out the key problems, and 
puts forward solutions to solve the key problems. The advantages and disadvantages of this paper and the future development dir ection are summarized as follows. 
5.1. Summary 
These methods have achieved some results to a cer tain extent, especially the vibration analysis 
methods for multi-faults and early faults, which re present the direction of  wind turbine gearbox 
fault diagnosis. Most of these methods enhan ce traditional methods through some innovations. 
Although these improved methods have achieved  good diagnostic results, there are still some 
shortcomings in these improved methods, which need  to be improved. At the same time, in order 
to achieve more accurate diagnosis, many method s from other academic fields are introduced, and 
abundant theoretical knowledge of fault diag nosis is accumulated. However, due to the 
characteristics of these methods, at the same tim e, there are some advantages and disadvantages, 
which affect the effectiven ess of fault diagnosis. Therefore, it is still a challenge to adjust all faults 
quickly and accurately. 
5.2. Prospect of some new methods 
In view of the poor working conditions of the gearbox of wind turbine, some effective solutions 
are put forward. Therefore, the following res earch areas need to be further strengthened: 
1) Sensor technology: Because of the compact structure of  the fan, it is difficult to find a 
suitable position to place the sensor  in the fan cabin. However, the main data comes from sensors. 
Therefore, according to the vibration mechanism of the gearbox of wind turbine, it is very 
important to select the sensitive point of the sensor. 
2) Fault feature extraction technology: Fault feat ure extraction plays an important role in fault 
diagnosis of wind turbine gearbox. The vibration signal of wind turbine gearbox is not only 
non-stationary and non-linear, but also polluted by background noise. An effective algorithm should be established to solve the difficulties in fau lt diagnosis and fault diagnosis. That is to say, 
the main function of the algorithm is to remove the noise of wind turbine gearbox vibration signal. 
At the same time, the normal mode of wind turb ine gearbox vibration signal is established, and 
the distance between the normal mode and noise e limination mode is foun d, and the improvement 
is made. 
3) Fault identification: Many intelligent methods have been applied to recognize faults of wind 
turbines gearbox, such as neural network [101], expert system [102], or Support Vector Machine 
(SVM) [103]. Although these methods achieved so me achievement in some extent, these methods 
all have their own drawbacks. New high-performance algorithm for wind turbines gearbox should be created and introduced. 
6. Conclusions 
This paper summarizes the SHCM of the gearbox of wind turbine and its fault diagnosis 
methods in the past few years. Aiming at the diffi culties of fault diagnosis of wind turbine gearbox, 
the research results of time-freque ncy analysis, vibration analysis and non-destructive testing of 
wind turbine gearbox are analyzed. These documents are of gr eat significance to the improvement 
of condition monitoring and prediction of wind turbine gearbox. The downtime and maintenance 
cost of the fan are reduced. At the same time, in  order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of 
fault diagnosis, the advantages and disadvantages of these new application methods are compared in detail. Combining fault feature extraction tech nology with fault recognition technology, some 
new intelligent methods with high performance are proposed and introduced into fault diagnosis 
of wind turbine.
