Abstract: Condition monitoring (CM) is used to assess the health status of wind turbines (WT)
by detecting turbine failure and predicting maintenance needs. However, ﬂuctuating operating
conditions cause variations in monitored features, therefore increasing the difﬁculty of CM,
for example, the frequency-domain analysis may lead to an inaccurate or even incorrect prediction
when evaluating the health of the WT components. In light of this challenge, this paper proposed
a method for the health evaluation of WT components based on vibration signals. The proposed
approach aimed to reduce the evaluation error caused by the impact of the variable operating
condition. First, the vibration signal was decomposed into a set of sub-signals using variational mode
decomposition (VMD). Next, the sub-signal energy and the probability distribution were obtained
and normalized. Finally, the concept of entropy was introduced to evaluate the health condition of a
monitored object to provide an effective guide for maintenance. In particular, the health evaluation
for CM was based on a performance review over a range of operating conditions, rather than at a
certain single operating condition. Experimental investigations were performed which veriﬁed the
efﬁciency of the evaluation method, as well as a comparison with the previous method.

1. Introduction
In response to the global energy crisis and the desire to reduce fossil fuel usage, wind energy
has become one of the most promising renewable energy sources due to its environmentally friendly,
socially beneﬁcial, and economically competitive characteristics. Condition monitoring (CM) is one
of the best approaches to increase the availability and reduce the operations and maintenance costs
for wind turbines (WTs). Condition monitoring systems [ 1,2] include sensors and signal processing
equipment to provide continuous indications of the state of a component, and are based on techniques
including vibrational analysis, acoustics, oil analysis, strain measurement, and thermography.
Furthermore, monitoring may be on-line to obtain the condition status in real time, or off-line to
analyze the collected data in detail [ 3]. With guidance from the condition monitoring, maintenance
tasks can be arranged in a reasonable schedule to prevent serious damage or WT failure [4].
To date, considerable effort has been expended in the development of CM and other technological
innovations [ 5–8]. Vibration analysis remains the most popular technology in wind turbines,

particularly for rotating equipment [ 9–11]. Many studies have been developed to enhance vibrational
signal processing in CMs such as short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and the Wigner-Ville distribution
(WVD) [ 12–14]. Alternatively, wavelet transform [ 15,16] is a time-frequency technique similar to
short-time Fourier transform (STFT), but is more appropriate for non-stationary signals with variable
time-frequency resolution [ 17]. The wavelet transform presents a time-frequency three-dimension
graph that decomposes the signal into a series of sub-signals or levels with different frequencies.
The wavelet transform is effective and reliable compared to other vibration analyses [ 18,19].
Nonetheless, considering the linear expansion in a single basis, neither the Fourier transform nor
the wavelet transform is sufﬁciently ﬂexible. As a result, the wavelet packet transform (WPT) [ 20]
was developed using a rich library of redundant bases with arbitrary time-frequency resolution.
The wavelet packet coefﬁcient set represents a signal with good local properties in the time-frequency
resolution and extracts the transient characteristics, which is more efﬁcient than STFT. In addition,
S-transform is superior in the condition monitoring of wind turbines as it eliminates the limitations
of STFT and wavelet transform. Furthermore, it also has more advantages in the time-frequency
analysis of non-stationary signals [ 21]. However, a challenge still exists due to the poor local adaptive
resolution. Hence, the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is attractive in signal processing for
its local adaptive feature [ 22]. The EMD is widely applied in CM WTs for its superior abilities to
process nonlinear and non-stationary signals [ 23,24]. Nevertheless, the EMD decomposes the CM
signal in recursive calculation, which limits its application due to several drawbacks: (1) The efﬁciency
of the EMD is decreased in the processing period since the algorithm of the EMD adopts recursive
calculation; (2) The error developed in the upper and lower envelop estimation will spread in the
recursive decomposition results; and (3) The intrinsic mode functions decomposed by the EMD are not
band-limited, which creates a mode mixing problem. As a consequence, there have been many studies
using EMD, such as the application of ensemble EMD and bivariate EMD in the condition monitoring
of wind turbines [25,26].
To overcome the shortcomings of the EMD, variational mode decomposition (VMD) has been
recently proposed as an alternative for EMD to separate the composite real-valued time series into
their respective modes [ 27]. In contrast to the EMD, the VMD decomposes a signal into several
principal modes, which are updated with the Wiener ﬁlter, and the central frequency of each mode is
gradually demodulated to the corresponding baseband. It is noted that VMD is theoretically much
better than sequential iterative sifting of the EMD as VMD is based on a clear variational model
and the resulting minimization steps extract the concurrent mode intuitively. As attributed by the
Wiener ﬁlter, the mode bandwidth decomposed by VMD is narrow, which not only overcomes the
mode mixing problem in the EMD, but also guarantees the accurate extraction of the time-frequency
features. Furthermore, by adopting non-recursive calculations, the VMD is more efﬁcient than the
EMD in computing performance. In addition, the VMD is more robust when addressing noise and
has stronger local decomposition abilities than EMD-based methods. Moreover, the instantaneous
frequency spectra generated by VMD has a higher resolution in both time and frequency than that of
STFT and WPT [28].
With the highlighted competitive advantage of the VMD, many researchers have tried to enhance
its potential application in CM signal feature extraction. Wang et al. [ 29] investigated the equivalent
ﬁltering and the applications on rotor-stator fault diagnosis, and proved its validity in detecting
rubbing-caused multiple features. Li et al. [ 30] proposed an independence-oriented VMD method
to adaptively extract the weak and compound fault features of the wheel set bearing via correlation
analysis where the appropriate mode number was determined by the criterion of approximate complete
reconstruction. In [ 31], a performance comparison of the VMD and the empirical wavelet transform
(EWT) was discussed regarding the classifying ability of the power quality by using supported vector
machine. Their results showed that the VMD performed better than the EWT in feature extraction.
To alleviate the negative inﬂuence of wind power generation, Zhang et al. [ 32] proposed a VMD-based
novel model to improve the predicating performance of the short-term wind power.

As mentioned above, these vibration-based approaches for the condition monitoring of rotational
machines have been mostly developed for certain ﬁxed operating conditions. When considering the
non-linear control behavior of wind turbines [ 33–35], the acquisition data varies over a wide range
of operating conditions [ 36], therefore, both the rotation speed and torque load also varies over the
ﬂuctuated ranges [ 37]. The changing feature obtained from the measured data does not necessarily
represent a problem with the turbine. Conversely, variations in an extracted feature only indicate a
change in the operating conditions, which signiﬁcantly increases the difﬁculty of condition monitoring.
Therefore, an adaptive data pre-processing technique is indispensable for extracting valid features
from the monitored components while normalizing the operational and environmental parameters.
For instance, Igba et al. [ 38] proposed a novel condition monitoring method based on the signal
correlation, extreme value, and root-mean-square (RMS) of the vibration signal to indicate early fault
detection. The results showed that the correlation between the signal and RMS values were sensitive
to failure detection in high speed bearing pitting and shaft cracks. Baydar and Ball [ 39] performed
gear deterioration detection under different loads by using the instantaneous power spectrum and
the WVD. Furthermore, they successfully performed gear fault detection, and indicated that the gear
faults were irrespective with variable operating conditions. Similarly, Fan and Zuo [ 40] combined
Hilbert and wavelet packet transforms to detect gear faults with the ability for handling non-stationary
signals. As WT components are often operated at variable wind speed, the CM signals of WTs always
contain intra-wave features, which increases the difﬁculty in fault extraction. Yang et al. [ 41] adopted
the VMD method to monitor the conditions when extracting features of wind turbines. The experiment
veriﬁed that the VMD performed better than the EMD, not only in noise robustness, but also in
multi-component signal decomposition, side-band detection, and intra-wave feature extraction.
From an information entropy theory perspective, the most uncertain probability distribution
has the largest entropy, and the entropy of the most certain probability distribution has the smallest
entropy. Based on this background, the information entropy theory is widely used in machinery
condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. Sawalhi et al. [ 42] developed a fault detection method for
the roller bearings based on the minimum entropy and spectral kurtosis. Tafreshi et al. [ 43] utilized
entropy measurement and energy map to realize the fault feature extraction and the classiﬁcation
of machinery fault diagnosis. He et al. [ 44] used the approximate entropy as a nonlinear feature
parameter to measure the irregularity of the vibration signals for fault diagnosis in rotating machinery.
Their experimental results indicated that the approximate entropy was effective in distinguishing four
typical faults including imbalance, misalignment, shaft rubbing, and oil whirl in rotation machines.
In [45], a novel approach based on Renyi entropy derived from coefﬁcients of the wavelet packet
transform was developed for the diagnosis of gearboxes in presumably non-stationary and unknown
operating conditions. The fault detection capabilities were veriﬁed efﬁciently by various seeded
mechanical faults of the two-stage gearbox operation under different rotational speeds and loads.
In this paper, an alternative approach to health evaluation was proposed that was adapted
to the varying operating condition. In particular, the vibration signal from the monitored object
was decomposed into a set of sub-signals using VMD. Then, the energy of each sub-signal and the
probability distribution of the energy at each sub-signal band was analyzed. Finally, the concept
of entropy was introduced to evaluate the health condition of the monitored object. The novelty
of the proposed approach included the following: (1) the health evaluation of CM was based on a
review of the experimental performance over a range of operating conditions rather than on a certain
operating condition; (2) the proposed approach reduced evaluation errors caused by the varying
operating conditions; and (3) experimental investigations were performed to verify the efﬁciency of
the evaluation method by comparing it with a previously used method.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a review of condition
monitoring theory. Section 3 describes the experimental setup and the proposed method for operational
safety evaluation based on the variational mode decomposition Renyi entropy. Section 4 contains the

Roller bearings are a key component of wind turbines. Before analyzing the bearing kinematics,
some assumptions are made about the bearing systems: (1) that the outer and inner races move at
a constant angular velocity; (2) all the elements in the bearing contact rigidly; (3) all the elements
move without any slip; and (4) the contact angle is constant during the operation. For constant speed
operations, the expression for the rolling element pass frequencies in the inner race ( BPFI ), the rolling

wavelet packet tree in Figure 1.

Each node of the WPT tree is marked by order ( d, n), where d represents the current depth of 
the WPT tree, and n stands for the node number at the corresponding depth d. The node order n 
shows the relationship with the depth d as n = 0, …, 2d − 1. Each node in the decomposing level n, 
contains a wavelet packet coefficient Pjn(k), k = 0, …, Nd − 1, which is expressed as follows:

Each node of the wavelet packet tree can be approximately used as a band-pass ﬁlter at the speciﬁc
frequency range. By calculating the power for each node, the probability distribution of the energy is
determined and analyzed at each frequency band. The energy of the decomposed signal at node ( d,n)

2.3. Variational Mode Decomposition
As an alternative method, the variational mode decomposition (VMD) [ 27] decomposes a signal
into a discrete number of quasi-orthogonal band-limited sub-signals. These sub-signals possess certain
sparse properties of the bandwidth in the spectrum domain, which determines the relevant bands
adaptively and estimates the corresponding modes concurrently. The details of the VMD are as follows.
To determine the bandwidth of each mode, the VMD ﬁrst converts the mode ukinto an analytic signal
uk+using the Hilbert transform with a single sided frequency spectrum as shown in Equation (8):
u+
k(t) =
d(t) +j
pt
uk(t) (8)
Then, the mode’s frequency spectrum is shifted to the baseband, adjusting the corresponding
estimated center frequency using the exponential term. Utilizing the squared L2-norm of the gradient,
the bandwidth is estimated from the Gaussian smoothness. The VMD method can be written as a
constrained variational problem:

where { uk}: = { u1,. . .,uK} and { wk}: = { w1,. . .,wK} represent the set of all modes and the relevant
center frequencies. The reconstruction constraint in Equation (10) can be addressed via a quadratic

The Alternate Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is utilized to determine the saddle point
of the augmented Lagrangian in a sequence of iterative sub-optimizations, the details of which are

2.4. Renyi Entropy
As a method to quantify the diversity, uncertainty, and randomness of the system in information
theory, the Renyi entropy is introduced as the indices of diversity in statistics, which is deﬁned as:
Hb(X) =1

å
i=1pb

(12)
where b0 and b6=1; and Xis a discrete random variable with possible outcomes; and the
corresponding probabilities are pi. The parameter ahas a signiﬁcant effect on the statistical result
of the Renyi entropy in Reference [ 47]. As bincreases, the sensitivity to a small probability event
will decrease as the statistical range of the Renyi entropy expands simultaneously. In contrast, as b
decreases, the sensitivity to a small probability event increases and the statistical range shrinks.
Therefore, the value of bneeds to be adjusted appropriately based on the signal features of the
transient components since the components of the signal are inﬂuenced by the low energy.
3. Proposed Method
3.1. Experimental Setup
To examine the performance of the proposed approach under ﬂuctuating operating conditions,
a motor-drive test-rig was built as seen in Figure 2. Due to the large size of the real turbine and
difﬁculty with the test, the test-rig was designed in a scaled-down size for the laboratory environment.
The test-rig consisted of two three-phase asynchronous induction motors on a ﬁxed test-bed, where one
acted as a prime mover in torque mode, and the other as an electric generator in speed mode.
The induction motors were controlled by a high-performance driver (Siemens SINAMICS S120 system
(2008, Siemens, Munich, Germany)). Both torque and speed curves were obtained under computer
supervision using the Proﬁnet protocol. Considering that the transmission of the variable-speed wind
turbine consisted of a two-stage planetary gearbox with one-stage parallel, the experimental setup
selects a parallel shaft gearbox to simulate the parallel axes stage of the wind turbine gearbox. In this
test-rig, the bearing ﬁxed in the gearbox operated at different rotation speed and load conditions.
Hence, the simulator setup acted as an integral system of the wind turbine. In this case, the roller
bearing ﬁxed in the gearbox was operated in a simulating condition like wind turbines. Additionally,
a torque-tachometer r was installed between the generator and the gearbox to measure the torque and
rotation speed of the bearing to monitor the real time operational conditions. Moreover, a National
Instruments (NI) cDAQ-9174 chassis (2012, National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA), in combination
with a digital Input/Output module NI-9401 and an analog voltage input module NI-9234, was used

to provide a frequency counter and A/D converter for signal acquisition. An integral electronic
piezoelectric (IEPE) accelerometer was connected to the NI-9234 module to determine the vibration
signal from the tested bearing. The torque-tachometer output two digital signals to the NI-9401,
where one represented the torque signal in an impulse sequence for a speciﬁc frequency, and the other
the rotation pulse from the optical encoder in the tachometer. Details on the data acquisition system
are shown in the Appendix A. The setup of the experimental test-rig is shown in Figure 3.

deﬁned in the Renyi entropy, which was set to 0.8 in the following experiment.
In this paper, we developed an approach to health evaluation based on VMD with the Renyi
entropy for condition monitoring. The test-rig was built in a scaled-down size for the laboratory
environment, which aimed at focusing on the roller bearing in the gearbox. Although the size of the
bearing was scaled down, the structure of the roller bearing was same as the one in the parallel axes
stage of a real wind turbine box. The vibration signal of the bearing in the time domain was acquired
on the test-rig setup using the NI-9234 hardware. The rotation speed and transfer torque were obtained
using the NI-9401 to monitor the experimental performance, rather than for the proposed condition
monitoring. Then, the vibration signal was processed using the variational mode decomposition
method to obtain the sub components for the proposed numbers, based on Section 2.3. By calculating
the relative energy distribution of the sub signal components, we deﬁned the variational mode
decomposition entropy to evaluate the condition of the bearings at an uncertain operating state.
A schematic diagram is presented as Figure 4, with a comparison to show the effectiveness of the
proposed method in the ninth sub-picture.

mode decomposition entropy to evaluate the condition of the bearings at an uncertain operating state. A schematic diagram is presented as Figure 4, with  a comparison to show the effectiveness of the 
proposed method in the ninth sub-picture.

4. Experiment and Discussion of Results
4.1. Experimental Description
To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, an experimental study was performed
on the test-rig to monitor the condition of the rolling bearings. The vibration signals from the tested
bearings were detected by a piezoelectric acceleration sensor, located on the gearbox on top of the
bearings. Details of the piezoelectric acceleration sensor are listed in the Appendix A. The sampling
frequency was 2 kHz and the length of each sampling time was 1 s. Moreover, the rotation speed and
torque were collected to track the operating condition in real time.
For the experiments, two tapered roller bearings were selected as the test bearings to simulate four
different health statuses. These were marked as Bearing A or B. The details of the selected bearings are
presented in the Appendix A. Defects in the outer races were introduced as small rectangular slits cut
using electro-discharge machining. The rectangular slit in Bearing A was 1 mm wide and 1 mm deep.
The rectangular slit in Bearing B was 2 mm wide and 2 mm deep, which corresponded to slight wear
in A and serious wear in B.
These selected bearings were all operated under different speeds and loads to study their effect
on the behavior of the bearing vibration. In particular, the drive speeds of the input axis were 700, 900,
and 1100 rpm and the load torques were 0.5, 1, and 2 Nm, respectively. Moreover, the tested bearing
was located at the output axis of the gearbox and the transmission ratio was 1:1.41. Thus, the output
axis rotation speed was 987, 1269, and 1551 rpm. Substituting these parameters based on the kinematic
parameters of the tested bearings and rotational speed, the corresponding fault frequency of the outer
race as determined as 7.3 fn, where fnis the shaft speed in Hertz. As a result, the characteristic bearing
defect frequencies of the outer race were 120.1 Hz, 154.4 Hz, and 188.7 Hz, respectively. Table 2
provides a quick insight into the detail of the operating condition setting and the characteristic defect
frequencies as follows.

4.2. Basic Analysis Characteristics
As above-mentioned, time and frequency domain analyses are basic and useful for condition
monitoring. The vibration signal waveforms in the time domain combined with the amplitude
spectrum for Bearing A in the frequency domain are shown in Figure 5. The peak values of
the accelerations were apparent at the characteristic defect frequencies for the wearing bearings.
This showed that ﬂuctuating operating conditions affected the amplitude spectrum at the characteristic
frequencies. For instance, the amplitudes at the characteristic defect frequencies increased by
approximately 0.1 m/s2as the load torque increased for the 1100 rpm condition in Figure 5g,i.
Meanwhile, the amplitudes at the characteristic defect frequencies increased approximately 0.2 m/s2
as the rotation speed increased from 700 rpm to 1100 rpm for the 2 Nm loading condition in Figure 5c,i.

increased with the rotation speed of the shaft; (3) am plitude values at these characteristic points also 
exhibited slow growth as the shaft rotation torque in creases; and (4) interestingly, under a high torque 
load and rotation speed (which is regarded as a serious operating condition), Bearing A exhibited a 
higher amplitude than Bearing B, which was operated under a low load and rotation speed. Although the wearing status in Bearing B was twice as large as that of Bearing A, the operating condition of the high rotation speed and the heavy torque raised a stronger vibration feature at the characteristic frequency.

It could be referred that the transmission trai n delivered the higher power energy during the 
high rotation speed and the heavy torque, which exci ted the component to act in response to a higher 
vibration level. In view of this situation, it can be concluded that the operating condition had a significant impact on the vibration signal, which is a vital factor that cannot be ignored during the condition monitoring. 
Therefore, the frequency-domain values of the sign al not only depend on th e health status of the 
bearings, but also rely on the operating conditions that describe the rotational torque and speed. As 
a consequence, frequency-domain analysis may lead to an inaccurate or even incorrect prediction for condition monitoring under fluc tuating conditions, particularly  when evaluating the health 
condition. 
4.3. Decomposition and Health Evaluation 
In light of the weakness of the frequency-domain analysis for different operating conditions, the 
probability distribution of the vibr ation signal was introduced to eval uate the health condition of the 
monitored bearing. Based on information theory, the mechanical faults of the bearing and the 
uncertain operating conditions can both affect th e uncertainty of the vibration signal, leading to 
results with a lower degree of uncertainty. With the above analysis, the proposed health evaluation 
using VMD Renyi entropy (referred to in Section 3.2) was adopted to analyze the vibrational signal as an alternative approach. Figure 7 shows the decomposed sub signal obtained by the VMD for 
Bearings A and B. For the VMD processing approach, the decomposition result depends on the parameters α and K. It should be noted that first, when K was too small, the vibration signal was 
under-binned, thus, the decomposition modes was either shared by the neighboring when α was 
small, or mostly discarded when α as large. Second, when K was too large, the vibration signal was 
over-binned. Thus, the extra modes consisted of large noise when α was small, or the key components 
were shared by two or more modes when α was big. In other words, too few modes by decreasing K 
led to under-segmentation of the signal, while too many modes led to the duplication of the mode or 
extra noise in the mode. Fortunately, all these un expected cases can be identified during the pre-
processing stage. Therefore, the optimal process can be reached from a large amount of trial data in 
the pre-analysis. In this experiment, th e optimal parameters were selected as α = 1200 and K = 8. The 
convergence criterion tolerance was selected as 0.01. 0 100 200 300 400 500 60000.10.20.30.40.50.6

As observed, after the decomposition, the shock components appeared on the higher order sub-
component in the time domain. Furthermore, we noted that the magnitude of the higher order sub-components increased with increasing rotation speed s and load torques, proving that the fluctuating 
condition did influence the time-domain behavi or for condition monitoring. Moreover, when 
comparing Bearings A and B using the same operat ing condition, the shock components presented 
more obvious characteristics in terms of the bearing with the greatest degree of wear. 
Next, the relative energy distribution was calc ulated as per Equation (12) based on the 
decomposed signal shown in Figure 8. Alternativ ely, wavelet packet decomposition was introduced 
to evaluate a healthy bearing as a comparison. The vibration signal of the bearings was also decomposed by Dmeyer (dmey) wavelet packet (WP)  decomposition, with a level set to three. The 
terminal mode number for the wavelet packet was ei ght, as for the VMD numbers. By calculating the 
power for each node, the relative energy of the de composed signal at all the terminal nodes was 
obtained using Equation (8). The relative energy di stribution could also be  performed using the VMD 
method. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1-404VMD for Bearing A: 700 rpm, 0.5 NmNo.1

Figure 7. The vibrational signal from Bearing A decomposed by VMD. ( a) Running in 700 rpm, 0.5 Nm;

As observed, after the decomposition, the shock components appeared on the higher order
sub-component in the time domain. Furthermore, we noted that the magnitude of the higher
order sub-components increased with increasing rotation speeds and load torques, proving that
the ﬂuctuating condition did inﬂuence the time-domain behavior for condition monitoring. Moreover,
when comparing Bearings A and B using the same operating condition, the shock components
presented more obvious characteristics in terms of the bearing with the greatest degree of wear.
Next, the relative energy distribution was calculated as per Equation (12) based on the decomposed
signal shown in Figure 8. Alternatively, wavelet packet decomposition was introduced to evaluate a
healthy bearing as a comparison. The vibration signal of the bearings was also decomposed by Dmeyer
(dmey) wavelet packet (WP) decomposition, with a level set to three. The terminal mode number
for the wavelet packet was eight, as for the VMD numbers. By calculating the power for each node,
the relative energy of the decomposed signal at all the terminal nodes was obtained using Equation (8).
The relative energy distribution could also be performed using the VMD method.
As mentioned in Section 2, both the VMD and WP can be treated as a band-pass ﬁlter. Therefore,
the relative energy distribution for each order component can describe the signal within a certain
frequency band. As seen in Figure 9, the relative energy distributions for Bearing A calculated from
the VMD and WP exhibited different trends.

Moreover, to decrease the random error in these experiments, a vibrational signal-acquisition
experiment for each bearing was performed 50 times under different operating conditions, as shown
in Table 2. The random condition for the rotation speed and the load torque was independent.
For rotation speed, a set of random numbers ranging from 700 to 1100 was generated by the “rand”
function on MATLAB. The count of the random number was 50. The generated random numbers were
distributed continuously from 700 to 1100. However, the setting operating condition of the rotation
speed in the experiments was 700 rpm, 900 rpm, and 1100 rpm, which was located as a separate step.
Next, the generated random number was rounded approximately to the nearest discrete step in 700,
900, 1100. The random condition for the load torque as also generated, with the only difference being
the random numbers ranging from 0.5 to 2. Finally, the random series of the rotation speed and the
load torque were matched in one to one correspondence to generate the random operating condition.
Figure 11 shows a histogram of the operational health degree coefﬁcient for both the VMD Renyi
entropy and WP Renyi entropy. The operational health degree coefﬁcient exhibited an approximately
normal distribution, and the 95% conﬁdence interval is also marked. Since the random condition for
the rotation speed was independent of the random condition for the load torque, the combination
of the generated operating condition was random, also showing a normal distribution. As a result,
the normally distributed result presented in Figure 11 indicated that the achieved result was reliable.
As presented in Figure 11 from the VMD Renyi entropy analysis, the average operational
health degree coefﬁcients for Bearings A and B were 0.778 and 0.401, respectively. In addition,
the 95% conﬁdence intervals of these health degree coefﬁcients were 0.778 0.055 and 0.4010.087.
Meanwhile, the wavelet Renyi entropy concluded that on average, the operational health degree
coefﬁcient of Bearings A and B was 0.759 and 0.434, respectively. The 95% conﬁdence intervals were
0.7590.122 and 0.4340.138, respectively. Thus, both analysis methods could represent the health
status of the bearing. Bearing A (slight wear) indicated a high safety degree coefﬁcient, whereas Bearing
B (medium wear) indicated a lower coefﬁcient. Additionally, we noted that the 95% conﬁdence interval
range for VMD entropy was approximately 50% less than for WP entropy.

Figure 12 shows a comparison between the VMD and the wavelet Renyi entropy analysis.
The operational health degree coefﬁcient, obtained from the vibrational signals from Bearings A
and B for different operational conditions, were compared using the error statistics method. The VMD
Renyi entropy had a better resistance performance than the wavelet Renyi entropy analysis. For Bearing
A—based on the VMD—the safety degree coefﬁcient decreased approximately 0.05, whereas the value
decreased by approximately 0.06 for Bearing B. However, when adopting the WP method, the safety
degree coefﬁcient decreased more than 0.2 for Bearing B, which appeared as though the bearing was
being continuously damaged under the ﬂuctuating operational conditions. Thus, when the system was
operated, the proposed VMD Renyi entropy analysis predicted a monitored bearing state more in-line
with the real state, even if the monitored bearing was running at a faster rotation speed or heavier load.
The difference in the conﬁdence interval was the intrinsic distinction between the VMD and wavelet
packet decomposition. The wavelet packet decomposition was approximately treated as a series of
band-pass ﬁlters at the speciﬁc frequency range, where the bandwidth of each band-pass ﬁlter was
ﬁxed. Therefore, the probability distribution of the energy in the wavelet packet decomposition was
located at each equal bandwidth frequency band. Additionally, as the wavelet packet decomposition
relies on the selection of the wavelet base in practice, this would lead to the variation in the analysis
result. In contrast, the variational mode decomposition decomposed the signals into a series of modes,
where each mode was treated as an AM-FM signal. Each mode had a limited and narrow bandwidth,
which shifted to baseband by mixing with a complex exponential of the current center frequency
estimate. In this circumstance, the relevant center frequencies of each mode could be captured precisely,
and the probability distribution of the energy was less affected under a different operating condition.

5. Discussion
According to Figures 5 and 6, the bearing vibration varied over a wide range due to the inﬂuence
of rotation speed and load torque. The reason for this is the variations in the transmission power at
the macro stage, which led to the spectrum deviating from its normal position. For variable speed
pitch-regulated WTs, their rotational speed and torque are precisely controlled to ensure efﬁcient
and safe power generation. As a consequence, nonlinearities caused by the pitch control should be
considered in the rotation speed and torque.
Concerning the complex rotation speed and torque condition, VMD Renyi entropy analysis
was carried out to provide a more reliable indication of the health status of WTs over a wide range
of operating conditions. Furthermore, the wavelet Renyi entropy analysis was introduced as a
comparison. As shown in Figure 11, both methods could identify the wear level of the bearings from
the average values.
However, the average value of the operational health degree coefﬁcient is based on large amounts
of data acquisition at random operating conditions. Figure 11c,d shows an interval twice as wide as
the one in Figure 11a,b. The operational health degree coefﬁcient based on the wavelet packet Renyi
entropy was much more affected by the variable operating conditions. In other words, the operational
health degree coefﬁcient based on the wavelet packet Renyi entropy exhibited signiﬁcantly more
variation as the operating conditions ﬂuctuated. As a result, a potentially incorrect result may be
generated for the condition monitoring system due to the variable speed or load. However, the VMD
Renyi entropy had better clustering performance than the wavelet Renyi entropy analysis due to its
compact interval for the ﬂuctuating conditions.
The advantage of the relative energy distribution is that it depends on the variations of the
vibration rather than the instantaneous values. Since VMD and WP decomposition may be roughly
regarded as a series of band-pass ﬁlters, the relative energy distribution for each order component can
describe the signal within a certain frequency band. Moreover, Figures 9 and 10 showed that VMD was
better at decreasing the impact of the ﬂuctuating conditions in terms of the energy separation in the
lowest-frequency component. As a consequence, VMD entropy provided the most reliable indication
of the health status of a WT.
Although the proposed CM method of the VMD Renyi entropy presented a better result, there
are still several points that need to be improved. As above-mentioned, the parameter Kandawas
vital to the decomposition result. The decomposition number Kneeded to be predeﬁned, which is the
same as other classical segmentation algorithms like wavelet packet transform. Both over-binning
and under-binning had a negative impact on the detected mode. The value aalso needs to be
properly selected to capture the center frequency. Furthermore, the selection of the convergence
criterion tolerance sis vital to guarantee the success rate and the efﬁciency of the VMD algorithms.
For instance, a low-noise level ensures an optimal result, but costs much more in calculation time.
Additionally, given that wind turbines operate with variable speed, the spectrum bands of vibration
signal would vary drastically over time. Nevertheless, the VMD does not work with non-stationary
signals. An alternative choice is to break the signal composition down in a shorter time block.
Hence, the vibration signal is approximately stationary in the short time.
Moreover, considering the control effects and inﬂuence of varying operational conditions,
a reliable CM of WTs should be based on a review of WT general behavior over a range of operational
conditions rather than its instantaneous responses. For instance, a large wind farm may consist
of hundreds of WTs, costing millions of pounds to equip each WT. A false alarm caused by the
operational conditions may result in long downtimes and high maintenance costs, leading to huge
economic losses. In contrast, when vibration does not increase with the continued deterioration of a
fault under low loads, the excessively long maintenance periods would lead to irreversible damage to
the WT. Therefore, based on both cases, the proposed method to determine the health degree coefﬁcient
evaluation is essential and meaningful when properly planning maintenance schedules.

6. Conclusions
This paper presented a method for the health degree coefﬁcient evaluation for a bearing under
variable operational conditions. Using variational mode decomposition and optimized process
parameters, the vibration signal was decomposed into a number of sub components. The calculation
of the power for each component was used to analyze the probability distribution of the energy
at each sub-component band. Subsequently, the Renyi entropy was introduced to evaluate the
health of the bearings, namely, the operational safety coefﬁcient for an uncertain operating state.
Several experimental investigations were performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed
evaluation method for condition monitoring. The conclusions of this study are summarized as follows:
(1) Frequency-domain amplitude of the vibrational signal is not only dependent on the health state
of the bearings, but also relies on the operational conditions such as rotation torque and speed.
(2) The evaluation of the probability distribution for the vibrational signal is more efﬁcient than the
time and frequency analyses, particularly for ﬂuctuating operating conditions.
(3) The improved evaluation algorithm based on the VMD Renyi entropy may decrease the impact of
the ﬂuctuating operating conditions and permit the identiﬁcation of the real state of the bearing
more effectively. The maximum error caused by the variable conditions was relatively small
when compared to wavelet packet decomposition. Thus, the reliability of the CM result was
signiﬁcantly enhanced.
In future study, the parameters of the VMD will be optimized with the operating condition in real
time using artiﬁcial intelligence in a more efﬁcient way than is possible with the empirical method.
