Abstract:  Condition Monitoring (CM) is considered an effecti ve method to improve the 8 
reliability of wind turbines and implement costxeff ective maintenance. This paper presents a 9 
single hiddenxlayer feed forward neural network (SL FN), trained using an extreme learning 10 
machine (ELM) algorithm, for condition monitoring o f wind turbines. Gradientxbased 11 
algorithms are commonly used to train SLFNs; howeve r, these algorithms are slow and may 12 
become trapped in local optima. The use of an ELM a lgorithm can dramatically reduce 13 
learning time and overcome issues associated with l ocal optima. In this paper, the ELM model 14 
is optimized using a genetic algorithm. The residua l signal obtained by comparing the model 15 
and actual output is analyzed using the Mahalanobis  distance measure due to its ability to 16 
capture correlations among multiple variables. An a ccumulated Mahalanobis distance value, 17 
obtained from a range of components, is used to eva luate the heath of a gearbox, one of the 18 
critical subsystems of a wind turbine. Models have been identified from supervisory control 19 
and data acquisition (SCADA) data obtained from a w orking wind farm. The results show that 20 
the proposed training method is considerably faster  than traditional techniques, and the 21 
proposed method can efficiently identify faults and  the health condition of the gearbox in wind 22 
turbines. 23 
1. Introduction 24 
There has been a dramatic increase in the construct ion of wind farms over the past 25 
decade in UK, especially offshore wind installation s, contributing to the UK achieving 26 
national targets for reducing CO 2 emissions and the production of sustainable energy . 27 
Compared to their onshore counterparts, the major a dvantages of offshore wind turbines 28 
(WTs) include increased turbine size, improved wind  conditions due to higher wind speed and 29 
lower turbulence, and reduced visual impact and noi se intrusion. However, the high cost of 30 
routine inspection and maintenance has been problem atic, particularly when the WTs are 31 
operating in harsh environments and are sited in de ep sea waters. Over an operating life of 20 32 
years, maintenance costs of wind farm may reach 15%  and 30% of the total income for 33 
onshore and offshore wind farms, respectively [1]. Condition monitoring (CM) is considered 34 
an effective method to schedule costxeffective main tenance activities and enhance the 35 
reliability of wind turbines [2]x[5]. Clearly, it i s essential to develop effective CM techniques 36 
for wind turbines, providing information regarding the past and current condition of the 37 
turbines and to enable the optimal scheduling of ma intenance tasks.  38 
Among CM techniques, dataxdriven modelxbased  methods (referred to as dataxbased 39 
methods thereafter in this paper) do not need to consider the mathematical model of t he 40 Page 1 of 22

 physical system; instead models are purely based on  data obtained by investigating the 41 
relationship between measured inputs and outputs. I n the dataxbased method, data gathered 42 
using a CM system or equivalent are used as the inp uts for models predicting the output 43 
signals of a physical process. Actual output signal s generated by the system are then compared 44 
to the predicted outputs for the corresponding inpu t signals. Any differences between these 45 
output signals could be caused by changes to the sy stem, and may be caused by the occurrence 46 
of a fault [6]. In this regard, the residual signal  can provide an early warning of imminent 47 
component failure. 48 
Although the residual signal can show impending com ponent failure, it does not provide 49 
accurate details regarding the failure of component s or subsystems in a wind turbine. One of 50 
the important aims of a CM system is to assist the operators to operate safely and reliably the 51 
wind turbines in order to avoid unnecessary operati ng outages. The outputs from such 52 
condition monitoring systems allow turbine operator s to make decisions with regards to 53 
maintenance scheduling through improved understandi ng of the turbine’s health condition. 54 
Reasonable maintenance strategies can therefore be implemented, which can significantly 55 
reduce the maintenance cost and enhance the availab ility and reliability of a wind turbine [7].  56 
This paper proposes a new method for condition moni toring and fault diagnosis of the 57 
gearbox in the wind turbines. The faults associated  with the gearbox account for a 58 
considerable proportion of total faults, which coul d contribute to approximately 20% of the 59 
downtime of a doublyxfed induction generatorxbased wind turbine, particularly for offshore 60 
wind farms [8]x[9]. For dataxbased condition monito ring systems, accurate models are 61 
essential for the relationships between those param eters being monitored. In this regard, 62 
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are utilize d by many researchers for dataxbased CM 63 
schemes, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) [10]x[12], support vector machines 64 
(SVMs) [13]x[14] and fuzzy logic [15]x[17]. ANNxbas ed methods are robust to signal noise, 65 
making them suitable for dealing with data acquired  in noisy environments. However, the long 66 
training times associated with ANN models can limit  their application. SVMs tend to have 67 
better generalized performance and more accurate tr aining results than neural network models; 68 
however, training SVM models with large datasets is  not straightforward. A fuzzy logic 69 
system, based on fuzzy sets of linguistic variables , uses predefined rules to enable reasoning. 70 
A fuzzy logic system is based upon fuzzified featur es of the faults and then uses these features 71 
to diagnose faults by using the predefined rules. I t is clear that a fuzzy logic system requires 72 
full knowledge of failure mechanisms of a wind turb ine in order to design these rules, which is 73 
usually unfeasible in practice. In this paper, an e xtreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm is 74 Page 2 of 22

 employed to train a neural network model for dataxb ased condition monitoring, overcoming 75 
the drawbacks of a traditional feedforward ANN. The  preliminary results obtained by the 76 
authors of this paper using the ELM for condition m onitoring of wind turbines can be found in 77 
reference [18]. In this paper, the ELM algorithm is  firstly optimized by a genetic algorithm in 78 
order to optimize the initial weight values and the  biases of the hidden neurons; then a 79 
classification method  based on the accumulated value of the Mahalanobis d istance (MD) from 80 
multiple components are used as the measure to asse ss the health condition of the wind turbine 81 
gearbox. The proposed method is able to integrate t he optimized ELM algorithm with an 82 
appropriate classification method utilizing differe nt components in the gearbox system, 83 
facilitating fast and reliable condition monitoring  and fault diagnosis of the wind turbines. 84 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows . The working principle of the 85 
extreme learning machine algorithm is presented in Section 2, while Section 3 describes the 86 
genetic algorithm employed to optimize the ELM mode l. Section 4 demonstrates the 87 
Mahalanobis distance method and proposes an accumul ated MD method in order to diagnose 88 
the health condition of a gearbox. Case studies usi ng SCADA data obtained from a working 89 
wind farm are discussed in Section 5. Finally, Sect ion 6 contains conclusions and suggestions 90 
for further research. 91 
2. The extreme learning machine algorithm 92 
Feedxforward neural networks with a single hidden l ayer (SLFNs) are particularly 93 
efficient and are used widely in several research a reas, including mode recognition and state 94 
prediction [19x21]. Gradientxbased backxpropagation  training algorithms, traditionally used 95 
during the learning procedure for a SLFN, have some  disadvantages, which can cause long 96 
training times of the model during the learning pro cess. Other issues include being stuck in 97 
local optima, improper learning rate, and overxfitt ing. In this regard, the extreme learning 98 
machine (ELM) algorithm was first proposed by Huang  as a nonxiterative algorithm to 99 
improve the learning process of a SLFN [22]. Compar ed with gradientxbased learning 100 
methods, the ELM algorithm incorporates the followi ng merits [23]x[24]: 101 
(i)  It arbitrarily initializes the weights on the input  and the biases, and calculates 102 
analytically the weights on the output. Note that t he output weights do not need be iterated 103 
repeatedly during training, resulting in faster lea rning than other algorithms. 104 
(ii)  Traditional gradientxbased learning algorithms are iterative and may become trapped in 105 
local optima. Other problems include overtraining a nd overfitting. These issues may interfere 106 Page 3 of 22

 with the training result, especially when modelling  a nonlinear system. In contrast, the ELM 107 
algorithm is better at the generalization of traini ng, thus overcoming these issues. 108

where the ith column of H is the vector of outputs of the ith hidden neuron given inputs x1, 131 
x2, · · ·, xn. Following initialization of the input weight matr ix w (L×n dimensions) and the 132 
hidden layer bias vector  b (length L), the matrix H (N×L dimensions) is uniquely determined. 133 
The matrix of output weights, β (L×m dimensions), can then be calculated by simply find ing 134 
a matrix βˆ in order to minimize the error function,  135

It is worth noting that the input weights w and the hidden layer biases b are not changed 137 
during this procedure. The solution is expressed as  the following: 138 
TM H+=βˆ         (5) 139 
Minimizing this function is equivalent to obtaining  the unique smallest norm leastx 140 
squares solution of the linear system in eq. (4). T he matrix H+ is the generalized Moorex 141 
Penrose inverse of the matrix H, which can be found using the singular value decom position 142 
(SVD) method.  Details about the SVD method can be found in refere nce [25].  143 
3. Genetic Algorithm Optimization 144 
As described in Section 2, arbitrary values are ass igned to the weights of the inputs and 145 
the biases of the hidden neurons of the ELM model a t the beginning of learning; clearly these 146 
parameters may not be the optimum values for the AN N. However, the training results of the 147 
ELM model largely depend on both the inputxtoxhidde n weights and hiddenxtoxoutput 148 
weights, hence the ANN tends to have better general ization performance given small values 149 
for the weights. The selection of optimal initial i nput weights and biases would therefore be 150 
essential for an effective ELM model. Thus, a genet ic algorithm (GA) is adopted to  optimize 151 
these weights and biases. GAs were originally propo sed by Holland [26], and are a kind of 152 Page 5 of 22

 parallel adaptive search algorithm based on the mec hanics of natural selection and genetic 153 
systems, where individuals are usually represented by binary  strings, as here . The algorithms 154 
have unique advantages, particularly in the fields of searching, optimization, and machine 155 
learning [27]. The purpose of using a genetic algor ithm in this study is to obtain optimum 156 
values for the initial input weights and the initia l hidden neuron biases so that the weights β 157 
can be calculated using eq. (5). In general, a gene tic algorithm has five steps, including 158 
initialization, fitness evaluation, selection, cros sover and mutation operations.  159 
The purpose of the selection operation is to obtain  the probability of an individual being 160 
able to contribute to the next generation, This is based upon each individual’s ‘fitness’, in this 161 
case, the optimum values for the initial input weig hts and biases. In order to achieve this, a 162 
roulette wheel selection technique is employed in t he GA. There needs to be a balance in order 163 
to maintain the selection pressure and the diversit y of the population. The crossover operation 164 
obtains new individuals from two ‘parents’. Here a kind twoxpoint crossover is used where 165 
two points are chosen on the parent chromosome stri ngs. Two child chromosomes are 166 
obtained by swapping the elements between two point s on the parent binary strings. Finally, 167 
the mutation operation introduces a random element to the individuals of the population. The 168 
rate of mutation decreases exponentially as the num ber of generations increases. For each 169 
mutation, a random number is generated. If the rand om number is smaller than the mutation 170 
rate, the value of the bit is flipped; otherwise, t he value remains the same. More details about 171 
the GA can be found in reference [28].  172 
When the internal weights and biases are initialize d, the ELM model calculates a 173 
predicted output. The fitness value can be found by  calculating the sum of the absolute errors 174 
of the expected output and actual output of the ELM ,  175

where  m is the number of outputs; yi is the ith predicted output of the ELM model; oi is the ith 177 
actual output of ELM model; although k is an application dependent constant, k=1 is norma lly 178 
selected [29]. 179 
The steps of the optimal extreme learning machine i ncorporating a genetic algorithm are 180 
described as follows: 181 
Step 1: Define the structure of the SLFN, including  the number of input layer neurons 182 
and hidden layer neurons, n and L respectively; arbitrary initial values are assigne d to input 183 
weights w and hidden neuron biases b. 184 Page 6 of 22

 Step 2: The input weights and hidden neuron biases are forwarded to the genetic 185 
algorithm. Through the five steps of the GA describ ed above, optimal initial values of the 186 
input weights and biases are determined. It is worth emphasizing that when the input weights  187 
and biases are initialized, the optimal output weig hts are uniquely determined, as described in 188 
the above section; thus output weights need not to be optimized by the GA.  189 
Step 3: The ELM model is then updated using the ini tial values of w and b. The model is 190 
subsequently trained with the training data, with t he hiddenxtoxoutput weights β being adjusted 191 
until the output data from the model match the targ et output data.  192 
  Step 4: A set of input data are then used to test  the model to observe how well the 193 
corresponding outputs are predicted. In this case, the output values are predicted signals of the 194 
process being modelled. The actual outputs are then  compared with the model prediction for 195 
given input signals, and the residual signals betwe en them are obtained. 196 
4. Health Condition Identification 197 
In this section, faults in a wind turbine gearbox a re investigated by comparing the 198 
difference between the actual signal detected in re al time and the predicted signal from the 199 
optimized extreme learning machine. Although a meth od relying on residual signals alone can 200 
detect faults effectively, it is not able to provid e accurate characteristics about the failure of 201 
components. Furthermore, the gearbox in a wind turb ine generally has several components, 202 
and traditional methods have only focused on detect ing faults or identifying the health of an 203 
individual component [10]. Clearly, it would be des irable to use a more appropriate method in 204 
order to identify the health condition of the gearb ox system as a whole.  205 
A minimumxredundancy maximumxrelevance feature appr oach is adopted in this paper 206 
to optimize the residual signal, taking into accoun t interactions between signals measured 207 
from different components in the gearbox. The Mahal anobis distance (MD) is a measure of the 208 
distance between a point and a distribution without  consideration of the units used for the 209 
measurement. This means that the MD measure has the  capability to describe correlations 210 
among variables in a process or a system. Thus, the  MD measure can provide a univariate 211 
distance value for multivariate data, which is idea l for estimating the deviation values of a 212 
complex system [30] [31]. Consequently, the MD meas ure is selected to help obtain the 213 
deviation from the group data, which can be used to  identify the health condition of the 214 
gearbox. For the ith observation vectors Xi = ( x1i, x2i, ..., xni ) and Yi = ( y1i, y 2i, ..., yni ), the MD is 215 
given by matrix 216

 where n is the number of parameters x1, x2, · · · , xn to be analyzed, for example, the 218 
temperatures and pressures of oil in the gearbox; t he matrix C is the covariance matrix of Xi 219 
and Yi , i.e., C =cov (Xi ,Yi), where cov  is a function for calculating covariance matrix  . In this 220 
paper, the residual signals from the ELM are used t o form an observation vector Xi. Yi is 221 
regarded as the reference vector with a reasonable deviation value.  In ideal conditions, the 222 
values in the reference vector can be considered to  be zero. 223 
MD values can be accumulated over a period of time t, indicating the deviation of the 224 
calculated MD value from the expected value for dif ferent components in the gearbox. 225 
However, it is necessary for a confidence band for the accumulated MD values to be defined. 226 
In this paper, the value of the confidence band is set to unity. If the accumulated MD values 227 
are below this level, the deviations are attributed  to signal interference, which are therefore 228 
ignored in the accumulation of MD values. Otherwise , the values are added to the accumulated 229 
MD value. Three relationships are considered in thi s study, including gearbox pump oil 230 
pressure with gearbox oil temperature, gearbox pump  oil pressure with gearbox bearing 1 231 
(main speed shaft bearing connected to the rotor) t emperature, and gearbox pump oil pressure 232 
with gearbox bearing 2 (high speed shaft bearing co nnected to the electric generator) 233 
temperature, assessing the condition of each compon ent in the gearbox. The definition of these 234 
signals will be described in the subsequent section . The MD values described in this section 235 
can therefore be extended to multiple processes.  236 
However, the durability and failure modes of each c omponent in a gearbox can be 237 
different; thus weights are allocated to represent the health impact of each component on the 238 
performance of a gearbox. Here, a multiple MD model  is defined as sum of all MD values 239 
above the confidence band observed during a defined  period of time. This multiple MD model 240 
can be used as the basis of an early warning system , with an alarm raised if the threshold is 241 
exceeded. 242 
The accumulated MD model with multiple components i s described as follows: 243

where  RIV  is the risk indicator value of the gearbox as a wh ole ; MD 1 is the MD value of the 245

gearbox pump oil pressure to the gearbox bearing 1 temperature; MD 3 is the MD value of the 247 
gearbox pump oil pressure to the gearbox bearing 2 temperature; α, β and γ  are the weights of 248 
these MD values, respectively. The RIV  takes the variability of each MD value into accoun t 249 
when determining its distance from the multivariate  center of the distribution, thus providing 250 Page 8 of 22

 a more sensitive indicator . As can be seen from eq. (8), the  RIV  and its derivative change over 251 
time and a higher value of the derivative represent s an indication of higher risk, indicating 252 
worsening health of the gearbox. 253 
5. Case Studies  254 
5.1 SCADA data 255 
 256 
Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) sy stems utilize hardware and 257 
software elements and IT technologies to monitor, g ather, and process data. In power systems, 258 
SCADA systems are used for a range of functions, in cluding data acquisition, control, 259 
adjustment of parameters, and generating warning si gnals. The SCADA data used here have 260 
been obtained from a working wind farm. The use of operational SCADA data is an effective 261 
way to demonstrate the algorithms described in this  paper. These data represent 12 months’ 262 
operation and consist of 128 variables, comprising temperatures, pressures, vibrations, power 263 
outputs, wind speed, and digital control signals. N ote that SCADA signals are usually 264 
processed and stored at 10 minute intervals, althou gh sampled in the order of 2 s. 265 
Power curves of two wind turbines, obtained from th e SCADA data, are shown in Fig. 2. 266 
Fig. 2 (a) illustrates a power curve of a healthy t urbine. It can be seen that power varies with 267 
the cube of wind speed below the rated speed of 15 m/s. When the wind speed is below the 268 
cutxin speed of 4 m/s, the rotor torque is not suff icient for the turbine to produce any power. 269 
When the speed of the wind is greater than the cutx out speed of 25 m/s, the turbine is shut 270 
down and does not generate any power. At wind speed s above the rated speed but below the 271 
cutxout speed, power output is restricted to the ra ted power of the turbine. This turbine has 272 
been chosen as the ‘reference turbine’, and forms t he basis of the ELM model. 273 
In contrast, Fig. 2 (b) shows the power curve of a faulty wind turbine. It can be seen that 274 
this turbine has, at some point, operated with redu ced power output. After studying the fault 275 
log of the turbine, it has been concluded that this  power reduction followed a fault with the 276 
gearbox. 277 Page 9 of 22

 286 
This paper is focused on gearbox faults and the hea lth condition of the wind turbine 287 
gearbox. The gearbox is one of the key components i n indirectxdrive wind turbines because 288 
the turbine rotor cannot match the synchronous spee d of the generator. The gearbox is used to 289 
transmit kinetic energy from the turbine rotor to t he electric generator, adjusting rotational 290 
speed and torque accordingly. However, the gearbox can be a major contributor to a turbine’s 291 
downtime, with common failure modes being bearing f aults and gear teeth faults. Surveys 292 
have shown that the root cause of gearbox failure i s due to rapid changes of torque from 293 
stochastic wind profiles, which create an uneven lo ad for the bearing and misalignment of gear 294 
teeth. Other causes of bearing and gear teeth failu re are elevated operating temperature and 295 
excessive contamination of the cooling lubricant du e to failure of the gearbox cooling system. 296 5 10 15 20 25 0500 1000 1500 2000 2500

 Any fault from the gearbox can result in an abnorma l input to the generator, reducing 297 
efficiency or, in extreme cases, damaging the gener ator [32] [33].  298 
Fig. 3 shows a schematic diagram of the structure o f a threexstage gearbox. The gearbox 299 
consists of three types of components, specifically , gears, bearings and the cooling system 300 
(usually oil cooling). In this paper, gearbox tempe rature and oil pressure measurements at 301 
different locations of the gearbox obtained from th e SCADA data [34] [35] are selected to 302 
monitor the condition of gearbox, which contain spe cifically temperature readings for gearbox 303 
bearing 1 (main speed shaft bearing connected to th e rotor), gearbox bearing 2 (high speed 304 
shaft bearing connected to the electric generator) and the gearbox oil (the temperature of 305 
gearbox oil is close to actual gear temperature) an d the pressure in the oil pump. The oil 306 
pressure shows the operating condition of the gearb ox cooling system.  307

prediction at hour 2850 indicating the onset of the  fault. Fig. 5 and Fig 6 show actual SCADA 319

and bearing 2 deviate from the model predictions at  hour 2850. At the same time, the actual 322 
gearbox oil temperature deviates from the predicted  temperature. Clearly, it can be concluded 323 
that the models provide a reliable and effective in dication of the onset of the gearbox fault. 324

 Abnormal levels of oil pressure in the gearbox pump  will affect heat dissipation from the 360 
gearbox, which is usually caused by faults in the g earbox oil pump, filter blocking of oilx 361 
conveying pipes or deterioration of the condition o f the cooling oil. Thus, the modelled 362 
predictions for the oil pressure in the oil pump ar e also considered here. Note that the gearbox 363 
pump oil pressure changes with the power output of the turbine. Fig. 7 (a) shows the actual oil 364 
pressure in the oil pump, while Fig. 7 (b) illustra tes the pressure of the oil as predicted by the 365 
ELM model. At 2850 hours, the residual signal in Fi g. 7 (c) shows that the oil pressure begins 366 
to deviate from the model prediction. In general, t he cooling system is able to keep the 367 
gearbox at the normal operating temperature to ensu re that no damage is caused, but when the 368 
temperature of the gearbox becomes abnormal, the re sidual signal of the oil pressure in Fig. 7 369 
(c) fluctuates between positive and negative values . This indicates that the cooling system is 370 
attempting to restore the normal working conditions  of the gearbox, but it is unable to do so 371 
effectively.  372

A desktop PC with a Xeon E3x1271 v3 3.6GHz CPU and 16GB RAM was used to 384 
implement the ELM. The time taken to train the ELM was compared with that taken to train a 385 
traditional BP back propagation neutral network usi ng a threshold training algorithm, an 386 
algorithm commonly used to train ANNs. The ELM algo rithm learns on an average of 0.16s 387 
compared to 22s using the BP method for the same tr aining sets. Consequently, the ELM 388 
learning algorithm run around 138 times faster than  the BP method.  The root mean square 389 
error (RMSE) is also employed here as a measure of how well the models explain the actual 390 
output data. The  RMSE values for the models with ELM and BP are 0.09 15 and 0.0862 391 
respectively. This indicates that the ELM model als o provides a good fit with considerably 392 
reduced learning time.  393

5.4 Fault identification 395 
 396 
In order to assess further the condition of gearbox  components, a MD measure of 397 
residual signals is used in this section to establi sh a relationship between the temperature 398 
change of gearbox components and oil pressure in th e gearbox oil pump. The residual signal 399 
of the oil pressure is shown in Fig. 7(c). The gear box component residual temperatures, shown 400 
in Fig. 4(c), 5(c) and 6(c), have been selected as the observation vectors. Hence, MD values of 401 
temperatures for the gearbox oil, gearbox bearing 1 , and gearbox bearing 2 in relation to the 402 
working condition of the cooling system are obtaine d. Figure 8 shows the MD values 403 
calculated using equation (7) for these gearbox com ponents. It can be seen that the MD values 404 
increase significantly at hour 2850, indicating the  onset of the fault. Compared to individual 405 2580 2670 2760 2850 2940 3030 3120 3210 x6 x4 x2 0246Error (bar)

 The accumulated MD values, referred to here as the ‘risk indicator’, describing 419 
relationships between the oil pressure and the bear ing temperature changes are shown in Fig. 420 
9. As can be seen from the figure, the risk indicators  of pump oil pressure to gearbox oil 421 
temperature, pump oil pressure to gearbox bearing 1  temperature and pump oil pressure to 422 
gearbox bearing 2 temperature demonstrate an almost  same change in the derivative over time, 423 
representing an approximately equal share of risk o f failure of each component. Therefore, for 424 
this case, the weightings of gearbox pump oil press ure to gearbox oil temperature,  α, gearbox 425 
pump oil pressure to gearbox bearing 1 temperature,  β, and gearbox pump oil pressure to 426 
gearbox bearing 2 temperature, γ, are each set to 1 /3. The accumulated MD values from these 427 
components are then calculated using eq. (8) to ind icate the health condition of the gearbox as 428 
a whole. Fig 10 shows the observed risk indicator v alues of oil pressure to bearing 1 429 
temperature  for the gearboxes of one faulty and two faultxfree  wind turbines over a period of 1 430 
month; the gearbox failure in the faulty wind turbi ne occurs at the middle of the month. When 431 
the fault begins to occur, the risk indicator value  increases dramatically to 3500, after 16 days 432 
of the fault occurring. Conversely, the observed ri sk indicator values for the two faultxfree 433 
wind turbines over the same month increases slowly,  simply because of component aging.   434

Fig. 9 also shows the observed risk indicators desc ribing the relationship between the 439 
bearing temperature changes and the oil temperature . Even though these risk indicators have 440 
demonstrated a similar change over time, the MD val ues associated with the oil temperature 441 
increase monotonically with the time, and hence do not show the onset of t he fault at hour 442 
2850. It can therefore be concluded that the fault occurs  in the cooling system, and the oil 443 2580 2670 2760 2850 2940 3030 3120 3210 0500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000 Risk Indicator Value

 pressure should be selected to diagnose the operati ng condition of the cooling system in the 444 
gearbox. As is well known, active cooling systems a re the main means for dissipating heat, 445 
which, for a wind turbine, include the oil lubricat ion system of the gearbox and the 446 
ventilation system of the generator. A typical gear box lubrication system in a wind turbine 447 
consists of an oil pump unit, a heat exchanger, and  an oil filter. Oil filters are used to remove 448 
impurities or metal particles within the lubricatio n oil in order to maintain oil quality and to 449 
prevent further wear of gearbox components. Pressur e sensors are installed at both ends of 450 
the filters to monitor their status, while a temper ature sensor is installed in the oil sump to 451 
measure lubrication oil temperature. The oil coolin g system is started if the oil temperature is 452 
over a certain threshold, usually 60°C [34]. In thi s paper, the increase in gearbox temperature 453 
is due to an oil filter becoming blocked, as indica ted in the alarm log and from an 454 
investigation of the SCADA data. The heat emission efficiency is reduced due to the oil filter 455 
blockage, leading to a rise in gearbox temperature.  456

6.  Conclusions 461 
In this paper, a dataxbased approach using an extre me learning machine (ELM) 462 
algorithm optimized with a genetic algorithm has be en proposed for condition monitoring of 463 
the gearbox in wind turbines. SCADA data, acquired from a working wind farm, have been 464 
used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ELM me thod. These data include the temperature 465 
of the oil in the gearbox, the temperature of the g earbox bearings, and the pressure in the 466 
gearbox oil pump. Models derived from these data ha ve been used to identify faults. It has 467 
been shown that the residual signals between the ac tual output and the predicted output are 468 2580 2670 2760 2850 2940 3030 3120 3210 0500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 Risk Indicator Value

 caused by a gearbox fault, providing an early warni ng of impending failure. The results also 469 
demonstrate that the ELM learning algorithm can pro vide a good fit with a considerably 470 
reduced learning time compared to a BP algorithm.  471 
Moreover, Mahalanobis distance (MD) values and accu mulated MD values, obtained 472 
from multiple components, are employed to identify the health condition of the gearbox. 473 
These MD values can detect the fault more effective ly by taking into account a range of 474 
different monitoring signals from the system. Obser ved risk indicator values, describing 475 
relationships between different components in the g earbox, have shown that the cooling 476 
system has a significant effect on the performance of the gearbox system.  477 
Note that the data used in this paper are mostly re presentative of the normal operation of 478 
wind turbines and do not contain a great deal of in formation regarding the occurrence of 479 
faults; consequently, this paper employs static ELM  models only. Future work will therefore 480 
consider dynamic models by taking into account the effect of more past inputs on the model 481 
output, and the different effect each component has  on the health condition of the gearbox. In 482 
this paper, the same value is used as the risk indi cator for several different gearbox 483 
components. It is clearly worth evaluating differen t risk indicator values, taking into account 484 
the residual signal produced from the ELM model and  the contributions to the downtime 485 
caused by failure of each component. A realxtime early warning system, employing an onli ne 486 
sequential ELM, will also be developed in order to predict faults in the operational wind 487 
turbines.  488
