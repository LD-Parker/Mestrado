Abstract  
This paper presents a method of anomaly detection within a 
gearbox by way of standardising temperature data. Assessing 
measured parameters in isolation is not sufficient to detect 
faults within a wind turbine. This technique uses temperature, 
rotational sp eed and generator torque to detect a bearing fault 
within the gearbox. Standardising data allows a parameter to 
be analysed which also takes into consideration the operating 
state of the wind turbine, therefore providing a more holistic 
view of the health of the wind turbine and component being 
monitored.  
1 Introduction  
Wind power is now the second largest energy producer  in 
Europe  with an installed capacity of 169GW  [1]. Although 
the cost of energy from wind power has fallen significantly in 
recent year‚Äôs  operations and maintenance costs still account 
for a significa nt proportion (around 30% [2]) of the costs, 
especially for offshore wind farms.  Condition monitoring 
systems are now beginning to play a major role in reducing 
the operations and maintenance costs by allowing better 
scheduling of maintenance and the avoidance of major 
component failures. Of these major component failures it is 
the generator and gearbox  which account for the largest loss 
of production due to the downtime resulting from  a failure  
[3].   
 
The work presented here focus es on the detection of faults 
within the wind turbine gearbox. Unlike conventional power 
generat ion methods , detecting faults within a wind turbine 
gearbox is more challenging due to varying frequencies that 
result from the continuously changing wind speed.  The 
varying wind speed means that the load on the generator and 
gearbox is continuously changing in order to allow for 
maximum energy capture. The ever changing operating state 
coupled with the changing ambient weather con ditions means 
that a holistic view must be taken when monitoring the health 
of a wind turbine.   
 
There are a number of techniques in literature which take into 
account the need to look at multiple parameters when 
attempting to detect faults and these are often known as multi -
variate techniques. Guo et al. [4] present a method which is based on the nonlinear state estimation technique (NSET). 
The method presented builds a model which represents 
normal behaviour  for the wind turbine ge nerator . This model 
can then be used to determine what the temperature s hould be 
at different points in  time. The residuals between the 
modelled temperature and actual temperature can then be 
used to detect abnormal behaviour. Zaher  et al.  [5], as do 
many others,  discuss the use of neural networks (NN) to build 
normal behaviour models for gearboxes. NNs have the ability 
to model nonlinear complex relationships between numerous 
input parameters and their associated outputs . They ha ve been 
used with high levels of accuracy for detecting faults in a 
number of methods presented in literature [6, 7] . NNs 
however do rely on a large volume of historic  data in order to 
train the models  and the lengthy  time required to train the 
model can be seen as a disadvantage of the technique .  
Schlechtingen  et al.  [8] seek to overcome some of the 
disadvantages associated with NNs through the use of 
Adaptive Neuro -Fuzzy Interference Systems (ANFIS) . 
ANFIS, like NN‚Äôs, are also able to model nonlinear 
relationships between parameters and do  this by setting up  a 
set of fuzzy rules which can be tuned during the training 
phase. In comparison to NNs, ANFIS requires fewer 
parameters to train the models which results in faster training 
[9].  
 
A number of techniques such as those discussed have been 
shown to be capable of detecting anomalies however their 
uptake within industry remains limited. This is du e to the 
difficulty in training NNs and the complex computations 
required in data driven techniques [10]. Coupled with the risk 
of false alarms, operators are hesitant to use these more 
complex techniques.  
 
The method presented in this work  provides a more simplistic 
technique  than those discussed through the use of 
standard ised data.  Within literature normalising is often 
something that is carried out in the pre -processin g stage of 
analysis. The term normalisation  is often used 
interchang eably with the term standardisation however it is 
worth noting the difference.  
 
Normalisation c an be defined by the equation:  
 
                        ùëãnew=(ùë•‚àíùë•min)/(ùë•max‚àíùë•min)             (1) 
 
and has the purpose of scaling  the data to a range of -1 to +1.  
This allows parameters with different units and scales to be 
directly compared.    
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
2    Standardisation on the other hand  transforms the  data to 
have a mean of zero and unit variance, as defined by:  
 
                                   ùëãnew=(ùë•‚àíùúá)/ùúé                         (2) 
 
where ¬µ is the mean and œÉ is the standard deviation of the 
dataset. It can be described as the number of standard 
deviations fro m the mean and is also known as a z -score.  
 
The work presented in this paper describes a method of 
detecting abnormal behaviour through standardising data for 
multiple parameters. This stand ardised data can  be used to 
construct a probability density function (PDF) for normal 
operating behaviour  and thresholds applied based on the 
probability of a failure occurring.  As would be expected, 
standardising the data produces a PDF with a normal (or 
Gaussian) distribution. This is convenient for anomaly 
detection by allowing s tandardise d raw temperature data to be 
analysed in relation to the thresholds to detect a fault or 
abnormal behaviour.   
 
2 Data Normalisation  
2.1 The structure of the data  
The SCADA and failure data used in this paper was obtained 
from 10 wind turbines located in 8 different wind farms 
throughout Europe. All turbines are the same in terms of 
manufacturer, turbine type, rated power, rotor diameter and so 
on. Exact turbine det ails cannot be provided for 
confidentiality reasons, however it can be stated that the 
turbines are modern multi -MW wind turbines from a leading 
wind turbine manufacturer and have a rated power of between 
1.5 and 4MW with a rotor diameter of between 80 and  120 
meters.  
 
The failure mode used in this paper is the same for all ten 
turbines. It is a gearbox planet bearing issue and is located on 
the low speed planetary stage of the gearbox. The bearing 
issue initiates in the raceway of the bearing and eventually 
results in complete failure of the bearing and subsequently the 
gearbox. When this occurs the turbine is shut down and only 
restarted once a complete gearbo x exchange takes place. 
Figure 1 shows a borescope image of the bearing in the lead 
up to failure in which indents in the raceway and rolling 
element can be seen.  
 
As with all ‚Äúreal data‚Äù there is an element of pre -processing 
which must be done to allow  for batches of varying length, 
turbine downtime, and outliers.

2.2 Parameter Selection  
Parameters were required to be selected which not only 
provided information about the health of the gearbox but 
which also provide information about the operating state  of 
the wind turbine .  Naturally there are certain parameters 
which will have a stronger correlation than others, such as 
wind speed and power output (before rated wind speed is 
reached). Others such as gearbox oil temperature and ambient 
temperature will have some level of correlation however this 
is often outweighed by the effect of the loading on the 
turbine .  
 
Based on the available data and  the type of fault it was 
decided  that bearing temperature would provide the clearest  
change in signal given the p resence of a fault  in the bearing  
itself . The SCADA data included 5 different measurements 
for bearing temperature on the gearbox however  following the 
initial analysis  it was found that it was the high speed 
generator side sensor which gave the clearest indication.  As 
previously discussed however , taking this single parameter in 
isolation is not sufficient to detect a fault. The other 
parameters that were s elected were therefore based on gaining 
knowledge of the operational state of the wind turbine.  
 
The parameters available in the SCADA data which could 
give an indication of the operational state of the wind turbine 
are wind speed, rotational speed and generator power output.  
Although the operational state of the wind turbine is directly 
related to the wind speed, the wind speed isn‚Äôt a reliable 
indicator of the operating state of the wind turbine. One 
reason for this is that when wind speed reaches and exceeds 
the rated wind speed, the rotational speed and power will 
become independent of the wind speed  in order to maintain 
rated power. Generator power output is able to give a good 
indication of the operating state of the wind turbine however 
it doesn‚Äôt provide the whole description of the operating state.  
The healthy gearbox losses (and hence heat and u ltimately 
temperature) are a mixture of torque dependent losses and 
rotational speed dependent losses.  As turbine control is based 
on torque and rotational speed parameter s, these can give  a 
better indication of the operating state. Although generator 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
3 torque isn‚Äôt provided in the SCADA data it can be calculated 
using:  
 
                                          ùëÑ‚âà30ùëÉ
ùúîùúã                                       (3) 
 
where Q is the torque, P is the generator electrical power 
output and œâ is the rotational spee d of the  generator.  Equation 
(3) is approximate as it neglects the generator losses.  
 
The three parameters used for the standardisation model are 
therefore:  
 
ÔÇ∑ Bearing temperature  
ÔÇ∑ Generator rotational speed  
ÔÇ∑ Generator t orque  
 
It should be noted that the bearing temperature was chosen 
based on the type of fault being examined; however given a 
different type of fault it is likely that a different sensor  
location  would provide better results.  
 
2.3 Normal behaviour model  
As is the case with many condition monitoring methods, this 
method is based on building a normal behaviour model.   This 
was achieved through the use of data which was known to be 
healthy. Using the Matlab Curve Fitting Toolbox, a model 
was developed for  bearing temperature, rotational speed  and 
torque . The temperature function  is represented by a 
polynomial function with three degrees of freedom for 
rotational speed and tw o degrees of freedom for torque, as  
represented by Equation 4 and  shown in Figure 2.     
 
 
ùëá(ùúî,ùëÑ)=ùëù00+ùëù10ùúî+ùëù01ùëÑ+ùëù20ùúî2+ùëù11ùúîùëÑ+

Figure 2: Normal behaviour model for bearing temperatu re, 
rotational speed and torque  
 To achieve an accurate result  in fitting the surface plot to the 
data, it was necessary to remove some outliers and data that 
would cause the normal behaviour model to be wrongly 
represented. This consisted of data that was c aptured when 
the turbine was not generating any power  and was removed 
by setting a threshold to the rotational speed. The removed 
data is represented by the red data points  in Figure 2.  
 
2.4 Standardising Algorithm  
The aim of standardising the data was to be able to provide a 
measure of bearing temperature which also takes into 
consideration the rotational speed and genera tor torque. The 
general method of standardising data is described by equation 
(2) where  the value being standardised has the dataset mean 
subtracted from it and is then divided by the standard 
deviation of the dataset.  Rather than subtracting the mean of 
the dataset, this method uses the value obtained from the 
normal behaviour function. The d ata is therefore standardised 
using the E quation  5: 
                            ùëástan=(ùëá‚àíùëá(ùúî,ùëÑ))/ùúé                         (5)    
                           
where Tstan is the stan dardised temperature , T is the  measured 
temperature , ùëá(ùúî,ùëÑ) is the healthy temperature obtained 
from equation (4)  and œÉ is the standard deviation for the 
healthy  temperature dataset.   
 
This method of standardising the data is described by the 
flowchart in  Figure 3.

 3 Anomaly Detection  
The purpose of standardising in this work is to transform the 
data into a format which can be used for anomaly detection. 
Anomaly detection has been defined as the problem of 
finding patterns in data that do not conform to expected 
behaviour [12]. By standardising as described above , data 
which describe s normal  behaviour  will, as expected, have a 
normal  distribution as shown in  Figure 4.  
 
 
Figure 4: Distribution for Normal Behaviour  
   
Therefore as a standardised temperature value is fourther  
away from zero it incr easingly indicates ‚Äò less normal ‚Äô 
behaviour . This characteristic of moving away from the norm  
will allow anomalies to be detected.  
 
Taking the case of the bearing fault,  Figure 5 below shows 
how the distribution of the data changes in the presence of a 
fault.  In this case the faulty data is ‚Äòstandardised‚Äô with the 
expected value and standard deviation of the healthy data set.  
As can be seen, in the presence of a fault the distribution of 
the data has a higher mean and larger standard deviation as 
compared to the healthy dataset .

To define when a standardised temperature value is abnormal , 
thresholds can be applied to an estimate of the probability 
density function as shown in  Figure 6.

thresholds  
 
In this case, we would expect the higher threshold (with a 
standardised temperature of 0.5) to indicate a fault. The level 
at which to set the thresholds is a n import ant parameter for 
the success of the technique  in an application setting . If the 
probability of detecting an anomaly  is to o high ‚Äì i.e. the 
upper standardised threshold is too close to the standardised 
temperature of 0 ‚Äì then there is greater chance of  false alarm s. 
The thresholds were chosen in this case based on t he data 
being normal when it has a probability greater  than 0.01% 
and abnormal when the probability is less than 0.01%.  
 
4 Results across a Fleet  
Analysis using the data standardising method was carried out 
for the 10 wind turbines described in Section 2.1. Initially a 
normal behaviour model was used which represented all 10 
wind turbines however it was found that although all 10 were 
of the exact s ame type and size of machine, there were 
significant differences between normal operating temperature 
ranges for each  (i.e. mean and standard deviation were 
significantly different) . It was therefore required that a normal 
behaviour function  be generated f or each specific wind 
turbine.  
 
Using the standardising method of analysis, the presence of a 
fault c ould be detected in all of the wind turbine s analysed . 
For one turbine it was possible to see the development of the 
fault two months prior to the failure,  as shown in  Figure 7, 
and one month before failure for all of the other cases . 
 
 
Figure 7: Distribution of data for normal, one month to fai lure 
and two months to failure  
 As can be seen from  Figure 7, as the fault develops the 
distribution of data moves in the positive x-axis indicating an 
increase in te mperature. It can also be seen that as the fault 
develops the standard deviation also increases.   Figure 7 is an 
example in which the presence of the fault can be clearly  seen 
due to the change in both mean and standard deviation, 
however throughout all of the data analysed the standard 
deviation is the more reliable indicator of a fault. This 
increase in standard deviation could be seen for all 10 of the 
wind turbines analysed  as shown in Figure 8. One of way  of 
checking this is through an F -test which checks the null 
hypothesis that the variance for the distributions of normal 
and failure data  is equal and that the variance of the failure 
data is greater than the variance of the normal data. As 
expected this null hypothesis verified that the variance was 
always higher for the data where a fault was present.  F-scores 
and their changes can be used to statically flag up abnormal 
failures.  
 
 
Figure 8: Comparison of standard deviation for normal and 
failure data  
 
In practice a batch of data may not be available to detect a 
fault but rather individual data points are assessed in relation 
to the thresholds shown in Figure 6.  
 
 
 
Figure 9: Time series of standardised temperature data for 
Park 1 Turbine 1  
 
Figure 9 shows how the time series of the standardised data 
would be used for anomaly detection. The thresholds that 
were defined are based on the probability density function 
used to detect abnormal behaviour. The wind turbine that 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
6 relates to Figure 9 gave a clear indication that a fault was 
present in the gearbox. There were a few data points classed 
as normal b ehaviour but fell above the upper threshold and it 
may be that the thresholds require adjustment to reduce the 
likelihood of false alarms.  
 
Not all wind turbines gave the same clarity of fault detection 
as can be seen from the wind turbine represented by Figure 
10. The fault in this case doesn‚Äôt progress in the same manner 
as that in  Figure 9. In this case it may not be possible to detect 
the fault until it has developed further and a more obvious 
increase in standardised temperature is observed.  In these 
cases, the ability to compare samples/batches of recent d ata 
by standard devi ation is a useful tool.

5 Conclusion  
Detecting anomalies within the wind turbine gearbox is made 
more challenging by the stochastic nature of the wind and the 
different operating states of the wind turbine. This paper has 
presented a method of anomaly detection which uses 
temperature, rotatio nal speed and torque to provide a 
standardised temperature value which gives a more holistic 
view of the condition of the gearbox. An expected 
temperature function for a healthy gearbox (based on a fitted 
polynomial function in torque and rotational speed)  was used 
as part of the standardised process, along with the standard 
deviation of the healthy data set. The  standardised 
temperature value allow s gearbox anomalies to be detected , 
either by comparing the statistical properties of sub -
populations of data to the healthy data set or by comparing 
individual data points to systematically chosen thresholds on 
the standardised temperature distribution.  
 
Although the work in this paper has focussed on detecting a 
gearbox bearing using the three discussed paramete rs, the 
same technique could be applied to other types of faults 
within the wind turbine gearbox or generator.  The success  of 
this detection method is very much dependant on the quality 
of data used. Large numbers of outliers in the normal 
behaviour data will reduce the  accuracy of the normal 
behaviour model. This will result in the standardised data 
being skewed. To avoid this care should be taken to filter out 
outliers  for start -up and shut -down . Care must also be taken in setting the thresholds as false  alarms are detrimental to the 
overall success of a condition monitoring system.
