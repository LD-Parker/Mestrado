ABSTRACT 
The gearbox is one of the critical components of a wind turbine. Proactive maintenance of wind turbine  
gearboxes is crucial to decrease maintenance and op erational costs and the long downtime of the comple te 
system. As the gearbox is a significant part of the  wind turbine, a fault in the gearbox leads to the 
breakdown of the wind turbine system. Hence, it is important to study and analyze the faults in wind 
turbine gearbox systems. In this article, a neural network-based model, a Bidirectional Long Short-Ter m 
Memory (BLSTM) fused with an autoencoder is intende d to categorize the condition of the gearbox into 
good or bad (broken tooth) condition. Feature learn ing and reduction are achieved extensively through the 
autoencoder. This improves the performance of the B LSTM model regarding time complexity and 
classification accuracy. This model has been applie d with time series vibration data of the gearbox in  a 
wind turbine system. The suggested model's performa nce is analyzed using an openly available wind 
turbine gearbox vibration dataset. The result showe d that BLSTM accuracy with an under-complete 
autoencoder is highly robust and appropriate for th e health monitoring of wind turbine gearbox systems  
using time series data. Also, in order to illustrat e the advantage of the projected model for fault an alysis 
and diagnosis in wind turbine gearbox, the throughp ut or time complexity of training and testing of th e 
split dataset is compared with the conventional BLS TM model.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
Wind energy is very popular, since it is form of cl ean 
energy. For the effective production of wind energy , the wind 
turbines must be maintained with less downtime. Gea rbox 
failure directly impacts the reliability of the gea rbox in the 
wind turbine. The operation and the cost towards th e 
maintenance of wind turbines installed at remote lo cations is 
around 15–35% of the installation cost. Around 80% of this is 
spent on unplanned maintenance issues resulting fro m defects 
in the wind turbine's various components [1]. Wind turbine 
fault analysis and diagnosis are usually performed manually 
from individuals with a high level of technical exp ertise. This 
method is inefficient and incapable of meeting the needs of 
wind farm operations and maintenance. It also leads  to 
production loss due to the prolonged unavailability  of the energy production system and requires a large numbe r of fault 
diagnosis analysts. The increase in demand for wind  energy 
needs reliable wind farms. To reach the demands, th e design of 
low-cost advanced proactive intelligent fault detec tion systems 
is crucial for better performance. The gearbox is o ne of the 
most vital and frequently worn parts of the mechani cal rotatory 
system of a wind turbine. Wind turbine gearbox fail ure 
diagnosis is critical in mechanical rotating system s, and 
unpredicted breakdown of this component results in prolonged 
system downtime. Wind turbine energy production uni t 
maintenance and operating may determine whether the  system 
is cost-efficient or not. Therefore, an intelligent  and proactive 
fault detection system, which reduces the downtime of the 
wind turbine energy production system, is essential , since it 
reduces the number of skilled professionals require d for 
maintenance. An expert system enables timely interv ention and

 early warnings and hence reduces production loss du e to 
prolonged unavailability. As a result, a smart syst em for 
condition monitoring of wind turbines improves the reliability 
by reducing downtime significantly. In the current work, the 
proposed hybrid Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memor y 
(BLSTM) model with an autoencoder achieves an accur acy of 
98.68% in wind turbine gearbox healthiness classifi cation and 
improves the performance by 71.73% in testing and 6 5.61% in 
training when compared with the original BLSTM mode l.  In 
the next section, various efforts to diagnose and a nalyze wind 
turbine gearboxes are discussed. 
II.  RELATED WORK 
A few efforts have been made to use traditional mac hine 
learning algorithms to classify the healthiness of the gearbox. 
The time-domain sequence Approximate Entropy (ApEn)  
adaptive strategy, a Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT)  filter, 
and a Cross-validated Particle Swarm Optimized (CPS O) 
kernel extreme learning machine were used to develo p gearbox 
fault analysis models in [1]. The Discrete Wavelet 
Transformation (DWT) was used to compute wavelet 
coefficients for vibration signals obtained from wi nd turbines. 
Wavelet coefficients are applied to Phase Space Rec onstruction 
(PSR) and singular value decomposition to extract f ault 
attributes in [2]. The Supervisory Control and Data  Acquisition 
(SCADA) process delivers the most frequently used i nput data 
for wind turbine anomaly detection [4]. By reducing  the feature 
dimension of the time-series data, Dynamic Principa l 
Component Analysis (DPCA) was used to identify faul ts in the 
gearbox of wind turbines in [5]. To extract gearbox  vibration 
features from oscillated vibration signals of gearb ox fault 
diagnosis, a method combining the Empirical Mode 
Decomposition (EMD) and Time Synchronous Averaging 
(TSA) was used in [6]. To detect anomalies in the w ind turbine 
gearbox, Twin Support Vector Machine (TWSVM) and an  
adaptive threshold were used in [7]. To extract fea tures from 
three-axial vibration data for fault diagnosis of a  wind turbine 
gearbox, a Deep Enhanced Fusion Network (DEFN) was used 
in [8]. The deep joint variational autoencoder meth od was used 
in conjunction with wind farm supervisory control a nd data 
acquisition to diagnose faults in the wind turbine gearbox in 
[9]. By decomposing vibration signals with a wavele t packet, a 
fast deep graph convolutional network model was use d to 
analyze the wind turbine gearbox in [10]. The fused  vibration 
signals were classified with a multiclass SVM model  in [11]. 
Electrical signals from generator terminals were us ed to find 
faults in the gearbox of the wind turbine in [12]. Using fault 
features of convolution channels and frequency band s of 
wavelet coefficients, the residual network can be u sed to 
identify a fault in the gearbox of a wind turbine [ 13]. The 
methods of convolutional neural networks and isolat ion forests 
were applied to classify the health of the gearbox of a wind 
turbine in [14]. The neighborhood component analysi s 
technique for best feature collection was used to e valuate the 
healthiness of wind turbine gearboxes in [15]. The remaining 
useful life of a wind turbine gearbox and its failu re can be 
predicted using machine learning methods such as ar tificial 
neural networks, SVM, and logistic regression [16].  CNN is 
used for feature extraction and representation, and  LSTM is 
used to learn the latent time series relationship b etween features in various periods of time [17]. An optimi zed LSTM 
neural network with cosine loss was used to analyze  wind 
turbine gearbox faults in [17]. The Cos-LSTM networ ks were 
analyzed using the wavelet energy entropy and energ y 
sequence features of the vibration signals in [18].  The 
traditional LSTM model was improved using multiple swarm 
intelligence models for classifying failures in the  wind turbine 
gearbox using vibration signal data acquired from t he faulty 
gearbox in [19]. The Simulated Annealing (SA) algor ithm was 
used to optimize the vibration of the powertrain sy stem in [21]. 
To analyze the functional schemes of the selected g ears, the 
method for trying to generate a mechanism of kinema tics 
equations for signal dependency graphs was used in [22]. 
Industrial bearing, fault detection, and isolation using time 
frequency domain has been applied and compared with  the 
theoretical results in [23]. The following are the main 
contributions of the current article: 
 Design of a gearbox diagnostic model using an 
undercomplete autoencoder and the BLSTM deep learni ng 
model. 
 Analysis of vibration data collected through sensor s. 
 Comparison of the proposed model's training and tes ting 
times to those of the conventional BLSTM model. 
III.  PROPOSED MODEL 
The projected model was created on undercomplete 
autoencoder along with a BLSTM-based hybrid model t o 
diagnose and classify wind turbine gearbox health c onditions. 
The undercomplete autoencoder and BLSTM architectur es are 
described below. 
A.  Undercomplete Autoencoder 
Autoencoders are unsupervised learning methods used  for 
representation learning. The neural network archite cture 
denotes autoencoders to impose a bottleneck in the neural 
network, resulting in a compressed feature represen tation of the 
original input. Autoencoders contain four layers, n amely input 
layer, hidden layer, bottleneck layer, and output l ayer. The 
objective of autoencoders is to minimize the number  of nodes 
located in the hidden layer in order to reduce the information 
flow through the neural network. An autoencoder mod el 
discovers the most important characteristics of the  input data. 
The compressed and essential features are extracted  at the 
bottleneck layer in order to recreate the original data with 
minimal loss. The number of neurons in the hidden l ayer is 
lesser than the number of neurons in the input laye r. The 
bottleneck layer contains fewer nodes than the hidd en layer. 
The reduced features are extracted from the bottlen eck layer.  
B.  Bidirectional LSTM 
The bidirectional LSTM recurrent neural network is made 
up of LSTM cells, which are memory blocks with a hi dden 
unit. Such states have the responsibility to transf er immediately 
preceding time step data in the network from the in put state to 
the next cell. These cells are made up of input, fo rget, and 
output gates. The forget gate forgets irrelevant in formation, the 
input gate updates new information, and the output gate passes 
the updated information to the next cell.

 C.  Design 
Figure 1 depicts the construction of an autoencoder  with a 
BLSTM-based model. To design the proposed model for  time 
series gearbox vibration data analysis, input sampl es of 3600 
(1600×2) with a sample size of 500 time steps were fed to the 
undercomplete autoencoder. The output of the encode r tapped 
at the bottleneck has reduced features and contains  350 time 
steps in each sample. The compressed data are loade d into the 
BLSTM model, which is trained for 500 epochs. To ac hieve 
better results, the model employs the rmsprop optim izer and the 
sigmoid perceptron at the output layer. The metrics  are 
recorded and discussed below.

IV.  EXPERIMENTATION AND RESULTS 
The developed autoencoder and BLSTM-based model wer e 
tested on experimental data collected in a publicly  available 
wind turbine gearbox vibration dataset [20]. Spectr a Quest's 
Gearbox Fault Diagnostics Simulator was used to gen erate 
vibration data for two conditions of the gearbox, o ne for good 
health and the other for a broken tooth, and both w ere subjected 
to bearing capacity ranging from 0% to 90%. Four se nsor 
nodes were positioned in 4 different locations on t he body of 
the gearbox. The dataset contains 10 samples with d ifferent 
loads of wind turbine gearbox vibration data in goo d and bad 
conditions. The dataset was created with a 30Hz fre quency for a total of 6.9s. Each sample was collected at a rat e of 12,800 
time steps/s. A total of 69s (6.9×10) for data gene ration for a 
broken tooth or bad condition and data generation f or a healthy 
condition was considered. Table I shows the raw rec orded data.

Each sample is made up of 88320 time steps. Because  the 
time series sequence is too long, the data have bee n divided 
into subsamples of 500 time steps. As a result, 176  samples 
from each sample of length 88320 time steps were de rived by 
considering 500 time steps for each individual samp le. As a 
result, we acquired 1760 (176×10) good-condition ge arbox 
samples and 1760 (176×10) bad-condition gearbox sam ples. 
The derived dataset contains 3520 samples, as shown  in Table 
II. The purpose of choosing 500 as the subsample's time step is 
to facilitate experiments, however the size of the sample set can 
vary. We chose 3200 sample data at random from a to tal of 
3520 for experiments.

To collect vibration data, 4 sensors were placed on  the body 
of the gearbox in 4 different directions. Table III  displays the

data frequency (dataset sample size in time steps) equal to 500 
time steps and a trained dataset with 500 epochs. T he results

 Since the Classification Accuracy using Sensor-1 an d 
Sensor-2 vibration data is optimum, the significanc e of Sensor-
3 and Sensor-4 vibration data analysis has less imp ortance. 
Hence, the diagnosis of the gearbox fault can be ac hieved with 
an exemption of Sensor-3 and Sensor-4 vibration dat a as these 
two sensors yield less Accuracy. Hence, the propose d model 
was tested only on Sensor-1 vibration data.  
Table IV shows different test cases with varied num bers of 
features extracted at the bottleneck layer of the a utoencoder 
with data frequency equal to 500 (number of time st eps in each 
sample), tested with Sensor-1 vibration data. The r esults clearly 
show that at the bottleneck output of 350 time step s 
outperforms the model with respect to Accuracy and Training 
and Testing Times.

The proposed method outperforms the BLTSM algorithm  
model in Classification Accuracy, Training Time, an d Testing 
Time. Based on the experimental observations; the r esults 
indicate that the gearbox fault vibration data feat ures can be 
learned to improve the generalization and the model 's accuracy 
by fusing the undercomplete autoencoder and BLSTM m odels. 
However, the result comparison in Tables V-VI shows  that the 
proposed model achieves 98.68% Accuracy with reduce d 
features (350 time steps) in the samples, and the p erformance is 
increased by 71.73% in testing time and 65.61% in t raining 
time when compared to the BLSTM model. As a result,  the 
fused model of autoencoder with BLSTM outperforms t he 
conventional BLSTM.
