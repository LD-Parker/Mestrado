Abstract: Condition monitoring is used to assess the reliability and equipment e ciency of wind
turbines. Feature extraction is an essential preprocessing step to achieve a high level of performance
in condition monitoring. However, the ﬂuctuating conditions of wind turbines usually cause sudden
variations in the monitored features, which may lead to an inaccurate prediction and maintenance
schedule. In this scenario, this article proposed a novel methodology to detect the multiple levels of
faults of rolling bearings in variable operating conditions. First, signal decomposition was carried
out by variational mode decomposition (VMD). Second, the statistical features were calculated and
extracted in the time domain. Meanwhile, a permutation entropy analysis was conducted to estimate
the complexity of the vibrational signal in the time series. Next, feature selection techniques were
applied to achieve improved identiﬁcation accuracy and reduce the computational burden. Finally, the
ranked feature vectors were fed into machine learning algorithms for the classiﬁcation of the bearing
defect status. In particular, the proposed method was performed over a wide range of working regions
to simulate the operational conditions of wind turbines. Comprehensive experimental investigations
were employed to evaluate the performance and e ectiveness of the proposed method.

1. Introduction
In the non-fossil policy of modern society, wind energy has become one of the most promising
renewable energy sources due to low CO 2emissions during its entire lifespan, which makes a wind
farm a very reliable and e cient choice in windy sites [ 1–3]. Besides the visual aspects, it is noted
that the noise impact may represent a major hindrance to new wind farms [ 4,5]. Considering the
noise pollution and the wind energy utilization, wind turbines are usually installed in complex
territory like hills or mountains under very harsh environmental conditions [ 6], and they su er from
changing weather, temperature, random wind speed, wind shear e ect, tower shadow e ect and severe
loads. Moreover, the wind shear and tower shadow e ect play a key role in reducing the accuracy of
predicting wind speed, which makes wind turbines operate under ﬂuctuating conditions [ 7]. All these
adverse factors cause wind turbines to encounter failure. To face the challenges associated with wind
turbine failure, condition monitoring has developed rapidly to increase the availability and reduce
the operations and maintenance costs of wind turbines [ 8]. Condition monitoring involves sensors
and signal processing equipment to identify the changes in the wind turbine components, predict
early faults and schedule the condition-based maintenance in time. The common approaches for

the condition monitoring of wind turbines include vibration analysis, acoustics, oil analysis, strain
measurement, and thermography [9].
There are many studies focused on condition monitoring and relevant technological innovations.
As vibration analysis is still the most popular approach, many studies have contributed to
signal-processing methods for condition monitoring, such as the short-time Fourier transform (STFT),
Wigner–Ville distribution (WVD) [ 10,11] and wavelet transform (WT) [ 12,13]. Alternatively, the
S-transform is superior in the time-frequency analyses of non-stationary signals, which eliminates the
limitations of STFT and WT [ 14]. Moreover, the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method shows
excellent performance in non-stationary signal processing due to its local adaptive feature [ 15,16].
Nevertheless, the EMD also has some limits in application due to its recursive calculation and
mode-mixing problems [ 17,18]. To overcome the drawbacks of the EMD method, variational mode
decomposition (VMD) has been proposed by decomposing a multicomponent signal into a set of
intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) [ 19], which has been proven beneﬁcial in signal reconstruction and
noise reduction [ 20]. Among the prior literature, the analysis techniques based on vibration data [ 21,22]
have been widely used for condition monitoring. In Ref. [ 23], the data analyses for condition monitoring
include conventional statistical analyses, trend estimation, physical modeling analyses and machine
learning. However, the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data analysis yields false
alarms [ 24,25] frequently due to the low sampling rate and noisy training data. Additionally, the
monitoring data vary over a wide range with the random operational conditions and the weather
environment, challenging the model accuracy of condition monitoring systems [22].
Alternatively, some e ort has been invested in data preprocessing to normalize the operational
variability. Refs. [ 26,27] incorporate the temperature of the gearbox as a reference parameter to evaluate
the health status of wind turbines. By building the energy balance model, the e ciency loss of the
turbine output power could be calculated to deliver the fault information. However, the environmental
temperature varied with the changes in season and a ected the accuracy of the proposed method. To
normalize the variable monitoring data, many studies have proposed using a statistical parameter as
the indicator feature, such as the average root mean square (RMS) amplitude, extreme value, average
deviation, skewness, kurtosis, shape factor, and cross zero rate [28].
Along with what was discussed above, the selection of the statistical parameter also needs to
be taken seriously because the features that carry useful information are beneﬁcial for increasing
the computational e ciency and the fault detection accuracy. Many feature selection criteria have
been proposed to improve the performance of identiﬁcation systems. The Wilcoxon rank sum and
information gain were adopted and compared in the classiﬁcation of muscle fatigue using surface
electromyography signals [ 29]. In Ref. [ 30], the Laplacian score (LS) is adopted to reﬁne the fault
features that were extracted from the planetary gearboxes under non-stationary working conditions.
The selected features were trained in a least square support vector machine. In Ref. [ 31], considering
the high dimensionality of the extracted original feature, the ReliefF algorithm is used to select optimal
features to optimize the support vector machine (SVM) performance. Additionally, genetic algorithms
(GAs) have been used to select the input features and the characteristic parameters of the classiﬁers for
bearing fault detection. In general, feature ranking is widely utilized in condition monitoring and fault
diagnosis to enhance the accuracy of the classiﬁcation result and ease the computational burden.
In this article, an alternative methodology for the condition monitoring of roller bearings is
proposed to investigate the e ectiveness of multifeature fusion under the varying operating conditions
of wind turbines. In particular, the vibration signal was decomposed to a set of intrinsic mode
functions by VMD. The statistical features of each IMF, which cover the multiscale moments and other
commonly used statistical properties of the distribution, are extracted by using the LibXtract library.
The Fisher score is adopted to select the e ective features. Finally, the selected features are imported
into the multi-class classiﬁer. To be speciﬁc, the multi-class classiﬁer focuses mainly on multi-class
SVM. Meanwhile, an artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) is imported as reference for veriﬁcation. Both
the accuracy of the evaluation results and the computational e ciency will be presented. The main

contributions of the proposed approach include the following: (1) the bearing detection of CM was
performed on a range of ﬂuctuating operating conditions rather than on a certain ﬁxed condition;
(2) based on the permutation entropy and Fisher score, the proposed method mitigates the adverse
impact of the ﬂuctuating conditions; and (3) experimental investigations were performed to verify the
eciency of the proposed method by presenting the experimental results and the performance analysis.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a brief review of the theoretical
background. Section 3 presents the experimental setup and the proposed method of condition
monitoring based on feature extraction, selection and classiﬁcation. Section 4 presents the experimental
description and the analysis, together with the discussion. Finally, the conclusions are presented.
2. Theoretical Background
2.1. Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD)
Variational mode decomposition (VMD) is aimed at decomposing a signal into band-limited
subsignals in a non-recursive manner. The decomposed signal, which is also deﬁned as intrinsic
mode function (IMF) uk, has certain sparse properties in the spectrum domain. It is assumed that each
subsignal is concentrated around a corresponding center pulsation. Thus, the bandwidth of each mode
is chosen by utilizing the H1Gaussian smoothness for the transformed signal.
To obtain the bandwidth of each mode function, VMD ﬁrst utilizes the Hilbert transform to
convert each mode ukinto an analytic expression uk+in a single-sided spectral domain as shown in
Equation (1), where (t) is the unit impulse function.
u+
k(t) = 
(t) +j
t!
uk(t) (1)
After the Hilbert transformation, the frequency spectrum of each mode is shifted to the baseband,
and the respective estimated center frequency is adjusted by using an exponential tuned term. Then,
the bandwidth is estimated through the Gaussian smoothness of the demodulated signal by utilizing
the squared L2-norm of the gradient [ 32]. Thus, the VMD process is realized by solving a constrained
variational problem [33]:

k=1uk(t) =f(t) (2)
where f(t) is the target signal, { uk}:={u1,:::,uK} represents the set of the decomposed modes and
{!k}:={!1,:::,!K} represents the respective center frequencies. Then, the constraint optimization
problem in Equation (2) can be converted into an unconstrained problem via a quadratic penalty term
and Lagrangian multipliers as below:
L(fukg,f!kg,)=KP

To solve the original minimization problem, the alternate direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
is adopted to determine the saddle point of the augmented Lagrangian in a sequence of iterative
suboptimizations. The details of the VMD algorithm are summarized in [ 19]. By this process, all
the mode functions are obtained and updated by Wiener ﬁltering to tune the center frequency in the
spectral domain:

The center frequency !knis calculated from the weighted center of each mode in the spectral
domain. This means that the center represents the frequency for the least squares linear regression of
the instantaneous phase. The VMD algorithm is presented in Table 1 as well as Appendix A.

2.2. Information Entropy
In the ﬁeld of information theory, entropy is a conventional approach to indicate the degree of
uncertainty in a random system. Since the entropy increases with the degree of randomness for an
observed system, it could be utilized in a quantitative analysis for feature extraction in the ﬁeld of
condition monitoring. Di erent entropy analysis has been studied and presented including Shannon
entropy, Renyi entropy, tsallis entropy, sample entropy and permutation entropy. Renyi entropy was
deﬁned as an entropy of order by Renyi [ 34]. The application of the Renyi entropy can be found
in many areas such as mathematical statistics, signal processing and economics. Another entropy,
permutation entropy, exhibits distinctive advantages in retaining the original information of time
series [ 35]. Moreover, permutation entropy is able to improve algorithm robustness for classiﬁcation.
Because permutation entropy has more parameters than Renyi entropy, it can obtain data information
under di erent conditions by controlling the change of parameters.
In this paper, Renyi entropy and permutation entropy are chosen as the extracted features for
the condition classiﬁcation. Also, the correlation of di erent features like entropy and time-domain
statistical value would be presented and compared in Section 3.2.
2.2.1. Renyi Entropy
The concept of Renyi entropy has been widely utilized to quantify the diversity, uncertainty and
randomness of a system for rotation machines. Consider a time series variable X, where the data length
is ﬁnite. The probability distribution of Xis deﬁned as Px. The Renyi entropy is deﬁned as:
RE(X) =1
1 log0
BBBBB@NX
i=1p
i1
CCCCCA(0,,1) (5)
It can be noted that the selection of the parameter is vital to the ﬁnal statistical result of Renyi
entropy. The ability to perceive a small probability is reduced as the parameter increases. Meanwhile,
ability to perceive a small probability is strengthened as the parameter decreases. Thus, the 
parameter should be appropriate based on the characteristics of the decomposed IMF. Additionally,
when theparameter is set as 1, the Renyi entropy is transformed into the Shannon entropy.
2.2.2. Permutation Entropy
The permutation entropy is utilized to recognize the health status of rotation machines [ 36].
By counting the ordinal patterns, the temporal information of the monitored object is recognized by
the permutation entropy. Since the Renyi entropy can only measure the degree of uncertainty in the
vibration signals in a single time scale, the permutation entropy is able to estimate the time-series
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2019 ,12, 3085 5 of 20
complexity after comparing the neighboring values. By deﬁnition, the permutation entropy is calculated
by the time-series probability density function based on the Shannon entropy. For a time domain series
with a ﬁnite length of N, {x(t)} (t=1, 2,:::,N), a segment can be constructed by an m-order dimension.
Each m-order segment is then sorted in an ascending sequence that is deﬁned as permutation pattern
. Considering the time delay , the m-order segment Xis deﬁned as follows:
Xm
i=x(i+(j1 1)),x(i+(j2 1)),,x(i+(jm 1))	(6)
From practical experience, the time lag is selected as 1, and the value m is selected from 3 to 7.
Hence, the number of m-order permutation patterns isthe factorial of m. The relative frequency of
each permutation pattern is calculated as follows:
p()=Hn
Xm
ihas type,i1, 2,:::,N m+1o
N m+1(7)
where H represents the number. Then, the permutation entropy is calculated by the probability density
function for the relative frequency:
PE(m) = m!X
i=1p(i)log(p(i)) (8)
2.3. Feature Selection
As mentioned above, since many features are extracted from the original signals, not all of them
are suitable to be involved in fault identiﬁcation. Some features may be redundant or even irrelevant,
which would lead to inaccurate identiﬁcation. The superﬂuous features increase the computational
burden. Hence, feature selection is especially vital to distinguish the relevant and the irrelevant
features, which improves the identiﬁcation performance.
2.3.1. Fisher Score
The Fisher score is one of the most popular algorithms for feature selection. As a supervised
algorithm, the Fisher score is adopted to rank each feature by the Fisher criterion, which quantiﬁes the
discriminative power of the features among the di erent classes. Consider a dataset in the i-th class.
The dataset { fik(1),fik(2),:::,fik(N)} is deﬁned as the k-th feature in the i-th class. First, the mean value
and standard deviation of the k-th feature are calculated as follows:
uik=1
NNiP
p=1fik
2
ik=1
NNiP
p=1(fik uik)2(9)
Then, the Fisher score value between the i-th and the j-th class is calculated as follows, where C
represents the number of classes.
FS(k)
ij=CP
k=1
fk
ij uk
i2
CP
k=1P
yi2k
fk
ij uk
i2(10)
As concluded from the Fisher score expression, a high Fisher score value represents a highly
relevant relationship of the k-th feature between the i-th and the j-th classes. The larger Fisher score
indicates that the feature shows a more relevant distinction between the classes. In other words, the
corresponding feature has a high priority to be selected for the classiﬁcation.

2.3.2. ReliefF
The ReliefF algorithm, which is one of the Relief family of algorithms, is also a supervised
method for feature selection. For a distinguishing feature, the distance between the instances from a
similar classiﬁcation is closer than that of a di erent classiﬁcation. Therefore, the Relief algorithm is
utilized as a ﬁlter to select the optimal features by analyzing the relevant weight between features
and classiﬁcations. Since the original Relief algorithm is limited to binary classiﬁcation, the ReliefF
algorithm was proposed to address multiclass problems, and it is more robust and noise-tolerant.
For a training dataset, D={d1,d2,:::,dm}, each instance contains pfeatures, deﬁned as where the
index iranges from 1 to m. When dealing with a binary classiﬁcation, the ReliefF algorithm selects an
instance di from the dataset. Then, two sorts of nearest distance neighbors are searched. One neighbor
is from the same class, which is deﬁned as the nearest hit H, while the other is from a di erent class,
which is deﬁned as the nearest miss M. For each feature t, the weight coe cient Wtis calculated as:
Wt=Wt di(t,di,H)/r+di(t,di,M)/r (11)
For numerical features, di(t,Ri,Rj) is deﬁned as:
di f f(t,Ri,Rj) =Rit Rjt
max t min t(12)
where min tand max trepresent the minimum and maximum values, respectively, of feature tin dataset
S. For a multiclass problem, the class label is set as C={c1,c2,:::,cl}. The ReliefF algorithm searches
for the knearest neighbors in the same class. Moreover, it also searches for the knearest neighbors in
each di erent class.
2.4. The Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM)
A SVM is a machine learning method based on statistical theory. By mapping the data vector in
high-dimensional feature space, it can ﬁnd an optimal separating hyperplane to divide two di erent
classes. The optimal hyperplane should satisfy the condition that the distance from the nearest data
point to the plane is maximized. The nearest points of the two di erent classes are deﬁned as the
support vectors.
In the training stage, the data are acquired for feature extraction. For multiclassiﬁcation, a
one-against-all method is adopted to treat the total dataset as two di erent classes, where one is
considered as Class 1 and the others are combined together as Class 0. Since the sample size of Class 1
is small compared with the total sample set, this method would lead a highly imbalanced dataset in
the classiﬁer training process. To overcome the problem of multiclassiﬁcation by an SVM, stratiﬁed
sampling is utilized to group the vectors by one feature. Based on the output result of the feature
selection, the most relevant feature is selected for classiﬁcation. Speciﬁcally, the feature value of each
sample set is sorted and divided into 10 equal-sized strata. Then, a sample set is ﬁltered from each
stratum randomly. Moreover, each selected positive sample is followed with the samples chosen from
the negative sample set, which is aimed to maintain consistency in the time series. In this method, the
negative dataset is more representative than the original samples. The multiclass SVM model has been
shown to be more robust than simple random sampling [37].
3. Proposed Method
3.1. Feature Extraction and Selection
For the recognition of di erent health conditions, it is essential to utilize the classiﬁcation method
to analyze the signal obtained from the accelerometer. However, it is hard to directly identify the
time-series signal by using the common classiﬁcation method. As a result, feature extraction is the ﬁrst
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Energies 2019 ,12, 3085 7 of 20
step to realize. The time-series signal is divided into 1-second segments. After that, the third-party
public library, LibXtract, is adopted to extract the statistical characteristics of the signals in the time
domain. The features extracted from the LibXtract library are listed in Table 2. Moreover, as the signal
is decomposed by VMD, the permutation entropy is imported as an evaluation indicator. All the
feature vectors need to be normalized. Then, the feature selection methods, the Fisher score and ReliefF
algorithm, which are described in Section 2.3, are utilized to ﬁlter the redundant features. The original
feature and the corresponding labels are marked in Table 2. The e ect and the correlation of the
selected features are compared and shown in Figure 1.

As shown in Figure 1, each single feature into the training set to  present the classification

based on the Introduction, we also import the ReliefF selection method as a reference to verify the 
importance of feature selec tion after extraction. In order to avoid random accuracy results occurr ing, 
the experimental results were conducted in 100 times. Then the accuracy results were concluded by 
averaging calculation. The correlation and the selected impact on the average clas sification accuracy 
for all the features are represented in Figure 1. Specifically, Figure 1a  presents the correlation result 
by Fish er score method while Figure 1b  presents the correlation result by ReliefF method. If the 
feature is irrelevant to the moni toring object, the corresponding Fisher score is nearly zero, which is 
same as ReliefF method. As a result, the average accuracy of the classification would be poor. 
Conversely , if the feature is highly relevant, the corresponding Fisher score value is rel atively large, 
as well as the ReliefF value. Thus,  the classification selected from the relevant features would 
achieve perfect accuracy. Mor eover, comparing with Figure 1a,b , it is observed that the total ranking 
order list is not agreed by Fisher score a nd ReliefF algorithm. Additionally, features such as F1 (RMS 
value) and F7 ( maximum value) are in the same ranking correspondingly, but get different score for 
each Fisher score and ReliefF algorithm. It is the reason that the score value merely represents  the 
weight coefficients in the same selection algorithm. Different feature selection methods reveal 
different performance, which produces different ranking order list. Selection score comparison is 
meaningless in different algorithm s. In spite of differen t performance for the Fisher score and ReliefF 
algorithm, feature selection is vital in the data preprocessing stage. It should be noted  that the 
threshold value of the selected feature is very  important. The threshold selection will be discuss ed in

3.2. Proposed Algorithm  
Combining the information entropy, feature selection and SVM classification, a novel approach 
for the condition monitoring of bearings is proposed in this article. The main framework of the 
proposed method is presented in Figur e 2. First , the time -series vibration data of the bearings were  
obtained from the scaled -down test rig by the NI -9234. The rotation speed and load torque were 
controlled by the high -performance motion control system, which aimed to simulate the kinetic 
environment of a real wind turbine. Second , the vibration signal was decomposed by variational 
mode decomposition, which aimed to extract a series of sub -intrinsic mode functions. Then, 
time -domain statistical features were extracted from the LibXtract library. As the signal is 
decomposed by VMD, the relative VMD energy was calculated for features as well. Meanwhile, the 
permutation entropy and Renyi entrop y were  imported as the feature element of vectors. All the 
features are listed in Table 2. By using the mentioned approach, we listed a wide range of features 
for the alternative selection. The feature selection method was employed to rank the relevant 
features based on the scores from high to low. We selected the top -ranked features to reconstruct the

extracted from the LibXtract library. As the signal is decomposed by VMD, the relative VMD energy
was calculated for features as well. Meanwhile, the permutation entropy and Renyi entropy were
imported as the feature element of vectors. All the features are listed in Table 2. By using the mentioned
approach, we listed a wide range of features for the alternative selection. The feature selection method
was employed to rank the relevant features based on the scores from high to low. We selected the
top-ranked features to reconstruct the new feature vectors. Finally, we fed the reconstructed feature
vector into the classiﬁer for training to identify the health condition of the bearing.
For speciﬁc implementation, the host computer supervises the motion control system by utilizing
OPC server technology, which guarantees both rotation speed and torque under control. Both the
motion control system and the data acquisition system were integrated on the LabVIEW environment.
In particular, the motion control with OPC server technology was realized by the data-logging and
supervisory control (DSC) packet. The data acquisition system was realized by the DAQmx driver
packet. The vibration data in time domain was obtained and saved as csv format in ﬁles. The data
preprocess module was implemented in C ++. The console application was intended to ﬁlter and
decompose signals by VMD. Moreover, the public feature extraction library, LibXtract, was integrated

4.1. Experimental Description
To verify the performance of the proposed method, a scaled-down test-rig was designed and built
in a laboratory environment in Figure 3, which was simulated as an integral system of the wind turbine.
Two three-phase asynchronous induction motors were ﬁxed on both ends of the bed. One motor was
operated as the mechanical power source under the torque-control mode, while the other was simulated
under the speed-control mode as the generator. Both motors were driven by a high-performance
motion control system. The controlling torque and speed curves were obtained from the kinetics
model of the original wind turbine. In this study, the roller bearing ﬁxed in the gearbox was operated
under simulated conditions, such as in wind turbines. Moreover, a data acquisition chassis, a National
Instruments cDAQ-9132 (2016, National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA), combined with a NI-9401
digital input /output module and an analog NI-9234 voltage input module, was adopted to collect the
operational data. An integral piezoelectric accelerometer was adopted to gather the vibration signal by
the NI 9234. The rotational speed and torque signal were acquired by the torque-tachometer connected
with the NI-9401. The interface software LabVIEW 2017 was programmed to control the motion and
collect the data series. The parameters of the piezoelectric accelerometer were 50 g for the range and
96.7 mV /g for the sensitivity. The frequency response range is from 0.5 Hz to 5 kHz and the excitation
current is 2 mA. The corresponding sampling frequency was 2 kHz, and the sampling time was 1 s.

An experimental study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. 
Four rolling bearings were set with different fault conditions . The defects in the outer races were 
introduced as small rectangular slits cut using electro -discharge machining. The rectangular slit is 3 
mm wide with 0.1 mm deep, 3 mm wide with 0.2 mm deep and 3 mm wide with 0.4 mm deep. The 
four different bearings, marked as NM, LF, MF and HF, represented the normal -, low -, medium - and 
high -fault bearings, respectively . The detail for the experimental bearings is shown in Table 3. In 
particular, the rotation speed was set at 700 and 1100 rpm. Meanwhile , the torque of the load motor 
was set at 0.5 and 2 N·m.

As mentioned above, the permutation energy is selected as one of the statistical input features 
for the classification. However, the permutation energy varied with the different levels  of the VMD

Figure 4 shows  the variation result of the permutation entropy with different decomposed levels for 
the different defective bearings. This figure showed that the fluctuating operating conditions affected 
the permutation  entropy of the worn bearings in the same decomposed levels. To be specific, Figure

4.2. Permutation Entropy Analysis
As mentioned above, the permutation energy is selected as one of the statistical input features
for the classiﬁcation. However, the permutation energy varied with the di erent levels of the VMD
method. Hence, the determination of the decomposition level is important for feature extraction.
Figure 4 shows the variation result of the permutation entropy with di erent decomposed levels for the
dierent defective bearings. This ﬁgure showed that the ﬂuctuating operating conditions a ected the
permutation entropy of the worn bearings in the same decomposed levels. To be speciﬁc, Figure 4a–d
represents permutation entropy results in four di erent condition of 700 rpm /0.5 Nm, 1100 rpm /0.5 nm,
700 rpm /2 Nm, and 1100 rpm /2 Nm, correspondingly. For instance, when the decomposed level K
was 5, the permutation entropy of the low fault bearing was 0.64 in the operating conditions of 700 rpm
and 0.5 Nm. Meanwhile, the entropy value dropped to 0.49 in the operating conditions of 1100 rpm
and 2 Nm. In addition, by analyzing the overall trend, the permutation entropy value decreased
with the wear status of the bearings. For another instance, when the decomposed level K was 5, the
permutation entropy of the bearings in di erent wear conditions decreased from 0.74 to 0.39, under the
operating conditions of 1100 rpm and 2 N m.

decomposed level K w as 5, the permutation entropy of the low fault bearing was 0.64 in the 
operating conditions  of 700 rpm and 0 .5 N·m. Meanwhile , the entropy value dropped to 0.49 in the 
operating conditions  of 1100 rpm and 2 N·m. In addition , by analyzing the overall trend, the 
permutation entropy value decreased with the wear status of the bearings. For another instance, 
when the decomposed leve l K was 5, the permutation entropy of the bearings in different wear

Based on the observation, the following can be concluded: (1) for a specific operating condition, 
the permutation entropy value exhibited a decreasing trend in the wear status of the bearings; (2) for 
a specific bearing, the permutation entropy value decre ased slowly with an increasing  rotation 
speed and load torque ; and  (3) the selection of the decomposed level K had an influence on the 
permutation entropy of the defective bearings.  
From the experimental result, it was determined  that the permutation entro py had the ability to 
recognize the wear status of the bearings under fluctuating conditions. Nevertheless, it is noticeable 
that the permutation entropy did not behave monotonically when the decomposed level K was 2, 3 
and 6. As a result, the determinatio n of the decomposed level K was vital during the VMD process. The 
small  number of IMFs  resulted in a lack of decomposition while the large number of IMFs led  to 
excessive decomposition. Therefore, the analysis of the permutation entropy not only depends on  the 
wear status of the bearings but also relies on the determination of the VMD level K. Particularly, it 
should be noted  that the condition monitoring based on the entropy analysis alone may lead to 
inaccurate or even incorrect results . Consequently, the  multi -feature fusion will be discussed in detail as 
follows.

as follows.
4.3. Multifeature Fusion
Considering the weakness of the single-feature analysis, multi-feature fusion is adopted to evaluate
the health condition of the bearings. In the extraction process from the fault information, the feature
vectors of the sample sets need to be normalized. Since the elements of feature sets have di erent
units, the numerical value must be normalized. In this paper, the min–max normalization method is

imported in Equation (13) as follows, where the Ziis the normalized result, Fmaxis the maximum data
of the vector, Fminis the minimum data, respectively.
Zi=Fi Fmin
Fmax Fmin(13)
Then, the feature selection method is applied to ﬁlter the redundant features. According to the
calculated values of the Fisher score, the highly distinguishable features were sorted from the original
vectors, which were then fed into the SVM model for the wearing-status classiﬁcation. As referred to
in Subsection 2.4, the stratiﬁed sampling method was employed for the multiclass SVM in this study
case, which treated one class at a time as well as other classes combined. By utilizing this method, the
negative sample sets were more representative in the training set, guaranteeing that the SVM model is
more robust than the traditional random sampling.
Figure 5a shows the classiﬁcation results obtained by utilizing the Fisher score method for feature
selection. Figure 5b shows the classiﬁcation results by adopting all 20 features without optimized
selection. As observed from the table of results, the classiﬁcation accuracy was better by distinguishing
the relevant features. Certainly, the computational burden would also be relieved, since the dimensions
of the feature vector were reduced. For comparison, the ratio of the samples for the training set to the
test set is 1:4. Twenty percent of the sample sets were selected for training, and the other 80% of the
sample sets were generated for testing. The ﬁnal statistical results were calculated for 200 trials.

In this case, the SVM and artificial neural network (ANN) classifiers were applied t o 
demonstrate the effect of the number of selected features. The sample sets were partitioned into 10 
equal folds , and the tests were performed for 10 iterations. The number of test instances  was 1000. 
The embedded dimension parameter of the permutation en tropy was set to 6. The time delay 
parameter of the permutation entropy was set as 1. For the SVM classifier, the penalty parameter 
was set to 20, and the radial basis kernel was selected as the kernel function. For the ANN classifier, 
a topology with 1 hi dden layer was constructed. The sensory units of the input layer are fed into the 
mentioned features including the statistical information in time domain, energy and entropy. In 
particular, the number of the sensory units is equal with the selected feature . Four neurons are set in 
the output layer because of the binary coding. Moreover, in our experiment, the best number of 
neurons is 16. The learning rate was set to 0.3, and the momentum was set to 0.2 for the multilayer 
perceptron. Two feature -ranking met hods, the Fisher score and ReliefF algorithm, were used for the 
feature selection. Figure 7 shows  the accuracy results by extracting different features through these 
two methods, where Figure 7a ,b presents training results by SVM model and ANN model, 
corre spondingly. It was observed that the prediction accuracy of the SVM classifier achieved 98.6% 
when the top 10 ranked features were selected by the Fisher score method. Similarly, the accuracy of 
the SVM classifier with the ReliefF algorithm reached 97.6% w hen the classifiers were fed the 10 
top-ranked features. The ANN classifier also gave a similar prediction accuracy with the 8 
top-ranked features. However, the SVM classifier with the Fisher scoring method showed better 
performance in identifying defectiv e bearings, particularly  in varying operational conditions .

In this case, the SVM and artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) classiﬁers were applied to demonstrate
the eect of the number of selected features. The sample sets were partitioned into 10 equal folds, and
the tests were performed for 10 iterations. The number of test instances was 1000. The embedded

a similar prediction accuracy with the 8 top-ranked features. However, the SVM classiﬁer with the
Fisher scoring method showed better performance in identifying defective bearings, particularly in
varying operational conditions.
Interestingly, from the accuracy trend obtained, it was noted that the diagnostic accuracy was
enhanced at ﬁrst with the increased number of ranked features. However, once the dimensionality of the

the SVM model were set to 100 and 0.02, respectively. Considering the robustness of the identiﬁcation
of the defective bearings under ﬂuctuating conditions, four datasets were selected to evaluate the
performance of the proposed method. Each dataset was obtained in di erent operational conditions,
which are presented in Table 4 in detail.
The performance of the proposed method on di erent datasets is summarized in Table 4.
The average results of Pdefect ,Rdefect ,Pother andRother were 96.7%, 93.7%, 92.4% and 98.6% for Dataset
I, respectively, under conditions of 700 rpm and 0.5 N m. For Dataset II, the values were 97.5%, 94.6%,
97.2% and 96.8%, respectively, under conditions of 1100 rpm and 0.5 N m. For Dataset III, under
conditions of 1100 rpm and 0.5 N m, the results were 96.4%, 94.3%, 95.7% and 98.5%, respectively, and
for Dataset IV , the results were 95.2%, 92.9%, 94.5% and 98.9%. From Table 4, the statistical results show
that the proposed method causes low false positives. However, the false negative cases were relatively
higher than the false positive cases. This result reﬂects the fact that the proposed classiﬁer was able to
identify the fault level of the defect bearing accurately, avoiding the increase in the false alarm rate.
As an evaluation method for the classiﬁer, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) value has
been widely used to depict the tradeo relationship between the true positive rate and the false positive
rate. Figure 8 shows the four ROC curves to represent the true positive rate versus the false positive

rate, which were calculated by a varying the threshold value . The threshold value was varied from 0
to 1 with a step of 0.02. The areas of the four ROC curves were 0.923, 0.931, 0.901 and 0.912, as shown
in Figure 9. To be speciﬁc, Figure 9a showed the ROC value in SVM training model, which is aimed
to analyze the classiﬁer performance with di erent selected features. Meanwhile Figure 9b shows
the ROC value by ANN training model, correspondingly. For the condition monitoring prediction, a
large false positive rate would incur a higher cost, due to the unnecessary maintenance for the wind
turbine, than would a small true positive rate. Inversely, a small true positive rate would also degrade
the usefulness of the condition monitoring system. Observed from the ROC curves, the proposed
method has su cient ﬂexibility to satisfy various requirements, either for the fault-detection sensitivity
or speciﬁcity.

The performance of the proposed method on different datasets is summarized in Table 4. The

5. Conclusion s 
This paper presents a new evaluation  method for rolling bearings in a fluctuating operational 
environment. By utilizing the variational mode decomposition, the vibration signal was 
decomposed to obtain a set of intrinsic mode functions. The statistical  approach and the permutation 
entropy were  adopted to extract the corresponding features, which helped to improve the feature 
extraction capability. Subsequently, feature selection methods, the Fisher score and ReliefF 
algorithm, were introduced to rank the relevant features based on the scores fr om high to low. The 
reconstructed feature vectors were fed into the SVM classifier for training to identify the health 
condition of the bearings. Several experiments were performed and analyzed to investigate the 
validity of the proposed method. The conclu sions of this research are summarized as follows. The 
permutation entropy analysis had the ability to recognize the wear status of the bearings under 
fluctuating conditions. Nevertheless, the determination of the decomposed level K was vital during 
the VMD  process. In particular, it should be noted  that condition monitoring based on an entropy 
analysis alone may lead to inaccurate or even incorrect results . Moreover, the feature selection 
process is beneficial and vital for the health evaluation of the bear ings. By distinguishing the 
relevant and irrelevant features, both the accuracy of the identification results and the computational 
efficiency will be improved. In particular, the Fisher score method showed better performance in 
ranking the relevant featur es under varying operational conditions. The proposed method can 
mitigate the adverse impact of fluctuating the wind turbine conditions and permit the identification 
of the real bearing state more effectively. From the performance analysis, the proposed me thod 
showed sufficient flexibility to satisfy various requirements, either for fault -detection sensitivity or 
specificity.  
In future studies , the selection of the VMD parameters will be optimized using information 
entropy theory  rather  than in an experient ial determination. Additionally, the semisupervised on -line 
learning method will be utilized to handle the unlabeled data at the training stage in the proposed 
work.

In order to present the VMD algorithm, we introduce an application example on a simple signal.
The artiﬁcial signal is consist of three sine signals, which is deﬁned as:
f(t) =cos(2f1t) +0.25 cos (2f2t) +0.16 cos (2f3t) (A1)
where f1=3 Hz, f2=12 Hz, f3=28 Hz, and the sample frequency is 1000 Hz, sampling time is 1 s.
It is obvious that the artiﬁcial signal can be decomposed into three modes. As mentioned above, the
decomposition results depend on the mode number, which is deﬁned as K. Therefore, we select K as 3.

where f1 = 3 Hz, f2 = 12 Hz, f3 = 28 Hz, and the sample frequency is 1000 Hz, sampling time is 1 s. It is 
obvious that the artificial signal can be decomposed into three modes. As mentioned above, the 
decomposition results depend on the mode number, which is defined as K. Therefore, we select K as 3 . 
The decomposition result is presented in Figure A1. Observed from Figure A1, the artificial signal is

Figure A3a,b, the frequencies of two modes are same, which is like mode duplication.
Based on what is discussed above, we can see that the VMD algorithm is able to decompose the
signal in an adaptive method. As same as a classical shortcoming of many segmentation algorithms, it
is vital to preset the number of clusters in the initial stage. For the VMD algorithm, the choice of K is
important. Moreover, the parameter of the data-ﬁdelity constraint, which inﬂuences the tightness
of the band-limits, is also important in the decomposition. The details of the VMD parameters are
