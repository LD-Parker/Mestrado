Abstract: Focusing on the investigation of a 3 MW wind-turbine gearbox, this paper’s aim is to
address the challenge of turbine shutdown due to the internal oil temperature exceeding its limits.
Additionally, there is the difficulty in measuring the internal temperature. To tackle these issues, a
thermal network model for the entire gearbox was developed. This model is based on an analysis
of the thermodynamic behavior of the three-stage transmission in the wind-turbine gearbox and
internal oil-spray lubrication. Through this model, thermal balance equations were established to
predict the steady-state temperatures under different operating conditions. This study delved into
the calculation methods for the power loss of heat sources in thermodynamic balance equations
and the calculation methods for different types of thermal resistance between nodes, forming an
adapted computational process. Applying this model, simulated analyses yielded temperatures at
various nodes and bearing temperatures under different operating conditions. These results were
compared with actual SCADA data, and steady-state thermal simulations of the high-speed stages
were conducted, demonstrating the model’s effectiveness in predicting steady-state temperatures
for a large-megawatt wind-turbine gearbox. Furthermore, the model-based analysis explored the
impact of the oil spray parameters on the gearbox temperature, providing a theoretical foundation
for further anticipating overheating malfunctions and optimizing the internal cooling systems.

1. Introduction
Based on statistical data from the People’s Daily , in 2022 [ 1], China’s wind-power
generation capacity surpassed 10 trillion kilowatts for the first time, demonstrating an
unstoppable trend in development. The issue of the oil temperature exceeding its limits in
gearboxes has become one of the high-frequency faults in wind power generators. Xiang,
et al. [ 2]. conducted a fault analysis investigation on three wind farms, revealing that
oil-temperature exceedance faults ranked in the top three among various failures. The
monitoring and reliability assessment of wind-turbine gearboxes are currently becoming
focal points of research [3].
Due to the frequent occurrence of high-temperature faults, an increasing number of
researchers are dedicating their efforts to studying the temperature field of wind-turbine
gearboxes. Extensive research and analyses have been conducted by domestic and in-
ternational scholars, such as Xu and Zhao, detailing the causes of and solutions to the
high-temperature issues in wind-turbine gearboxes [ 4–6]; however, these investigations
focus on external factors affecting the gearbox temperature field. To enhance preventive
measures and mitigate downtime failures caused by high temperatures, researchers have
initiated an analysis of internal high-temperature faults in gearbox systems.
Huang, et al. proposed a fault-prediction method based on PCA and SPC-dynamic
neural networks for online learning, allowing for the long-term online prediction of wind-
turbine-gearbox oil temperature. However, relying solely on lubricating oil temperature

for gearbox fault prediction poses the issue of potential failure omission [ 7]. Gu, et al.
introduced a novel approach for fault prediction in wind-turbine gearboxes by segmenting
intervals, thereby overcoming the limitations of using a constant lubricating oil temperature
as the warning threshold. However, the exclusive consideration of gearbox oil-temperature
data during fault prediction [ 8]. Jing, et al. proposed a method based on KECA-GRNN
capable of conducting gearbox condition monitoring, fault prediction, and health assess-
ment, enabling the early prediction of gearbox faults. However, this method only predicts
gearbox oil temperature and bearing temperature [ 9]. He. proposed a method based on the
conditional convolutional autoencoder Gaussian mixture model (CCAE-GMM), which ad-
dresses the inaccuracies or missed alarms in fault information due to the limited number of
sensor variables. This method achieves health assessment and fault prediction for gearbox
temperature, power, and wind speed, and provides other information [10].
Although the aforementioned methods enable fault prediction for wind-turbine-
gearbox temperature fields, they overly rely on SCADA data, making them susceptible to
errors from sensors and other devices themselves. Moreover, they encounter challenges
related to high model instability and lack of interpretability.
Utilizing finite element analysis methods for analyzing gearbox temperature fields
can help address the aforementioned shortcomings. Song Hai. employed this approach to
individually analyze the temperature field of wind-turbine gearbox bearings [ 11]. Liu [ 12]
conducted an investigation on the steady-state thermal performance of the gearbox. Desh-
pande [ 13] utilized this method to predict the temperature of gears in oil-jet lubricated
transmissions. In conclusion, the finite element method can accurately predict the temper-
ature distribution of the gearbox. However, finite element modeling entails complexity,
necessitates precise boundary conditions, requires significant computational resources, and
is less suited for the comprehensive calculation of entire wind-turbine gearboxes.
The method that can simultaneously avoid the drawbacks of the two aforementioned
approaches and accomplish the analysis of the temperature distribution in wind-turbine
gearboxes is the thermal network approach. Based on internal heating and heat-transfer
principles, this method enables the prediction of temperatures for all internal gearbox com-
ponents while mitigating the risk of prediction errors due to data collection and component
inaccuracies. Moreover, it demonstrates a low computational burden, swift processing
speed, and robust applicability in forecasting temperatures for large structures such as
wind-turbine gearboxes. Therefore, this study opted to employ the thermal network ap-
proach for research purposes. The thermal network approach has mature applications
in areas such as helicopters [ 14] and electric cars [ 15]. X. Dong et al. [ 2] first introduced
this method to the structure of wind-turbine gearboxes, enabling the prediction of inter-
nal temperatures for 1.5 MW wind-turbine gearboxes. However, 1.5 MW wind-turbine
gearboxes utilize a relatively simplistic spur-gear transmission method, and the thermal
network model in their paper does not account for the impact of oil-spray lubrication on
the gearbox temperature.
The aforementioned research on the temperature field of wind-turbine gearboxes
primarily focuses on 1.5 MW wind power systems. However, with technological advance-
ments, the application of 2 MW and larger, gigawatt-scale wind turbines is becoming more
widespread. Moreover, the structures and stress factors of gigawatt-scale wind-turbine
gearboxes are more intricate. Gigawatt-scale wind turbines utilize a combination of oil-
spray lubrication and splash lubrication in their cooling and lubrication systems, which
significantly impacts the gearbox temperature field. Nevertheless, research on temperature
fields in gigawatt-scale wind power systems remains relatively scarce at present.
Thus, this paper innovatively establishes a thermal network model suitable for a 3 MW
wind-turbine gearbox. In contrast to the 1.5 MW wind turbine, the gearbox of a 3 MW wind
turbine employs a triple-stage transmission system, entirely characterized by helical gear
transmissions capable of withstanding significant alternating loads, rendering them more
structurally complex. Furthermore, the oil-spray system is incorporated into the thermal
network model for the first time, resulting in steady-state nodal temperatures and enabling

the prediction of gearbox temperatures under various high-temperature conditions. This
thermal network model can be applied to gigawatt-scale (exceeding 2 MW) wind-turbine
gearboxes with similar transmission structures and lubrication methods. However, it is
essential to note that when critical components’ structures differ, corresponding calculation
methods need adjustment (such as bearing selection and heat generation methods in
the transmission system under different input load conditions). Additionally, this paper
investigates the impact of the oil spray parameters on the gearbox steady-state temperatures,
providing robust model support for the temperature prediction and design optimization of
the cooling and lubrication systems.

2. Principles of Transmission and Temperature Monitoring in 3 MW  
Wind-Turbine Gearboxes 
The transmission principle of a 3 MW wind-turbine gearbox is illustrated in Figure 
1. The transmission system comprises two st ages: planetary transmission and high-speed 
parallel gear transmission. 
The generator inputs speed and power to th e input shaft, which transmits it to the 
first planetary carrier. The planetary carrier drives the first planet, and the engagement of 
the first planet gears with the first sun gear and the first stage ring gear is facilitated. This 
transmission is conveyed to the next stage through a key integrated with the output shaft, 
which is also integrated with the sun gear. The second stage follows the same 
configuration. The third-stage low-speed shaf t and the second-stage output shaft engage 
through a key, receiving speed and torque. Acceleration is achieved through the meshing 
of a pair of helical gears, ultimately resulting in output through the output shaft. The 
internal gear and bearing parameters are detailed in Tables 1 and 2. The bearings are sourced from SKF.

To achieve the real-time monitoring of the operational status of wind turbines, wind
farms widely employ SCADA systems for the real-time monitoring of environmental factors
(such as wind speed and direction) and turbine data (generator speed, blade angles, etc.).
Simultaneously, this system is responsible for compiling and providing real-time feedback
on crucial temperature data, including the inlet oil temperature, gearbox temperature, and
high-speed shaft bearing temperature. Table 3 below shows an example of SCADA data for
a certain enterprise’s mountainous 3 MW wind turbine.

3. Thermal Network Model Construction
3.1. Thermodynamic Analysis of the Interior of a Wind-Turbine Gearbox
In predicting the temperature of the gearbox, establishing a thermal network diagram
involves an initial analysis of the internal heat generation and conduction methods [ 16].
The internal heat within the gearbox originates from three main sources: (1) heat generated
during gear meshing due to sliding and rolling friction; (2) heat generated by the relative
sliding and rolling friction of the internal rollers, the inner and outer rings of the bearings,
and the structure of the cage; and (3) heat generated during the transmission process due
to the movement of gears and bearings stirring the lubricating oil. However, in large-
megawatt gearboxes, this heat generation is negligible, and it is disregarded in this study.
Internal heat propagation within the gearbox occurs through three main mechanisms:
thermal conduction, convective heat transfer, and thermal radiation. However, due to
the compact structure of the gearbox internals and the minimal temperature differences
between components, this study focuses on analyzing the significant impacts of thermal
conduction and convective heat transfer on overall heat propagation. Thermal conduction
occurs between various contacting components inside the gearbox, including meshing
gears, bearings, and their contacting shafts. Convective heat transfer primarily occurs

through natural convection between air and the gearbox casing and forced convection
between the internal lubricating oil and components such as gears and bearings.
3.2. Node Selection and Thermal Network Diagram Construction
The thermal network method, based on circuit computing principles, divides the
gearbox into a finite number of nodes, forming a node network. Nodes are interconnected
through thermal resistance values, and thermal balance equations are established based on
the node network. The system’s temperature distribution is then obtained by solving these
equations [16].
Therefore, the accuracy of the final results is critically dependent on the careful se-
lection of the nodes. An excessive node density can increase computational complexity,
while an overly sparse node selection may compromise precision. Considering the research
objectives and the desired accuracy of the results, this study opted for 48 nodes. Detailed
information is provided in Table 4 and Figure 2.

Nodes 1, 2, and 3 represent the steady-state temperature values of the internal and
external air of the gearbox and the gearbox oil temperature. These values can be provided
through SCADA data and used as inputs for solving the steady-state heat balance equations,
enhancing the practicality and interpretability of the equations.
Utilizing a first-order steady-state iteration method to solve the above balance equa-
tions, the calculation of the steady-state temperature field is simplified. The heat balance
equations are organized, and in matrix form, they are expressed as follows:

4. Calculation of Parameters for Steady-State Temperature Solution of the Gearbox
4.1. Analysis and Calculation of Gear Meshing Power Loss
The 3 MW wind-turbine gearbox employs a helical gear transmission. Based on
the working principle of helical gear meshing, the frictional losses generated during gear
meshing include both rolling friction loss and sliding friction loss. This loss is converted into
heat energy. Various methods can be used to calculate the heat generated by gear meshing,
including HOHN, ISO-recommended algorithms, and the Anderson–Loewenthal method.
The Anderson–Loewenthal method has a broad calculation range, fewer limitations, and is
suitable for the diverse gear transmission calculations in this paper, considering the large
load, complex structure, and various transmission forms [17].

4.2. Analysis and Calculation of Bearing Operating Power Loss
The bearing parameters of the gearbox are shown in Table 2 above, and the distribution
of the bearings is illustrated in Figure 2. The bearings are sourced from SKF, which has
summarized experience-based formulas for bearing calculations applicable to its prod-
ucts [ 18]. Internal friction in rolling bearings can be divided into internal sliding friction
and internal rolling friction. For example, at the contact between the thrust collar of the
inner ring and the large end of the tapered roller in a tapered roller bearing, due to the
different speeds of revolution and rotation of the roller, varying degrees of sliding friction
are generated. Under a significant axial load, this type of friction can cause considerable
harm. Additionally, the friction between the roller, inner and outer rings, and the cage also
generates a considerable amount of heat [ 19,20]. Therefore, the heat generated by bearing
friction has a significant impact on the gearbox temperature. The calculation method is
shown in Formula (16).

4.3. Calculation of Thermal Resistance and Convective Heat-Transfer Coefficient
4.3.1. Calculation of Thermal Conductive Resistance
The thermal conduction between the components is mainly divided into plane thermal
conduction and cylindrical-wall thermal conduction. In this paper, plane thermal conduc-
tion exists between the nodes of the gearbox body itself, between the planetary gears, and
between the input shaft nodes. Cylindrical-wall thermal conduction exists between the
gears, bearings, shafts, and circumferentially contacting surfaces. The calculation methods

4.3.2. Calculation of Convective Heat Transfer Resistance [21]
The convective heat transfer within the gearbox involves thermal exchange processes
among air, the casing, internal lubricating oil, and various structural components. Due to
the substantial power losses and high heat generation within the wind-turbine gearbox,
compounded by its enclosed environment, dissipating heat becomes a formidable challenge.
Consequently, the lubrication and cooling of the internal components are accomplished
through two methods: oil-spray lubrication and splash lubrication. In the multi-megawatt
wind-turbine gearbox, oil injection ports are integrated into the gear meshing and bearing
positions for lubrication. The 3 MW wind-turbine gearbox comprises seven gear oil-
injection points and fourteen bearing oil-injection points. According to the diagrams
provided by the company, the diameter of the gearbox oil-injection ports in this study is
2.5 mm. MOBIL 320 oil with a density of 860 Kg/m3is used for lubrication. The total
lubricant flow rate amounts to 285 L per minute. The calculation methods for the convective
heat-transfer coefficients of each component are outlined as follows:
(1) Convective heat transfer between the casing outer wall and air.
The casing is simplified as a uniformly heated cylindrical structure, and convective
heat exchange with air is modeled as self-heating convection with a uniformly heated
vertical plate structure.

(2) Convective heat transfer computation for the bearings and lubricating oil.
In this design, the bearings encompass various types, including cylindrical roller
bearings, tapered roller bearings, angular contact ball bearings, and deep groove ball
bearings. In the calculation, the bearings are treated holistically as a singular node. Conse-
quently, in the convective heat transfer computation, the bearings are considered a unified
entity, eliminating the need for separate calculations for the inner ring, outer ring, and
rolling elements.

(3) Heat transfer resistance between the gears and lubricating oil.
For rapidly rotating gears, the prudent design of the internal lubrication system is of
paramount importance due to the substantial heat generation and the relative challenges
associated with lubrication. Essential factors such as the position, diameter, and angle of
the oil injection nozzles play a critical role in effectively reducing the gear temperature
and providing the necessary lubrication. Concurrently, the rotational motion of the gears
agitates the lubricating oil, achieving a splash lubrication effect. The calculation of the
average convective heat transfer coefficient on the gear surface follows a specific formula,
while the convective heat transfer coefficient on the side of the larger gear is computed
based on the fluid-swept surface [14].

During the operation of the gears, the lubrication and heat exchange processes of the
casing and internal lubricating oil can be represented by a simplified model of heat-fluid
sweeping over a uniformly heated plate. This streamlined model takes into account the
heat exchange between the lubricating oil and the inner walls of the casing during the
agitation of the lubricating oil [22].

steady-state oil temperature, air temperatur e inside the nacelle, and air temperature inside 
the gearbox, as well as the high-speed bearing temperature data, can be obtained. Taking 
the steady-state oil temperature and gearbo x temperature during the high-temperature 
months of June to August as input values for six actual operating conditions, the 
conditions are detailed in Table 6. Based on  this, employing a first-order steady-state 
iterative method for solving the balance equation system (Equations (2)–(4)), the 
computed results are depicted in Figure 6. 
 
Figure 6. Steady-state node temperatures in the wind-turbine gearbox. 
  
Figure 6. Steady-state node temperatures in the wind-turbine gearbox.
Analyzing the results from Figure 6 reveals that high-temperature nodes are predomi-
nantly concentrated at the third-stage high-speed position. The temperature at nodes 35
to 48, corresponding to the third high-speed position, is on average 3.4 to 3.6◦C higher
than the nodes of the other two stages of transmission. This is because the third-stage
transmission is primarily responsible for acceleration, resulting in higher gear and bearing
speeds, intensified friction, and, consequently, higher heat generation compared to other
locations within the gearbox. The downwind bearing position in the high-speed stage
(node 41) attains the highest rotational speeds, and its proximity to other heat-generating
points in the third stage makes heat dissipation challenging. Consequently, this node
experiences the highest temperature and is the most susceptible location to the occurrence
of high-temperature faults. The high-temperature position in the first stage occurs at the
meshing point of the planetary and sun gears (node 15), which endure significant input
loads. Failure at this location incurs substantial replacement and maintenance costs.
Analyzing the overall temperature distribution, except for the external air node tem-
peratures, other node temperatures stabilize between 50 and 70◦C. Furthermore, under
various operating conditions, the temperature distribution trends remain consistent. High-

temperature nodes act as heat sources, resulting in a trend where temperatures decrease
to varying degrees from the heat source, following the heat propagation pattern. The
temperatures predicted by the thermal network model in this paper conform to the flow
patterns of heat propagation within the gearbox.
5.2. Comparative Validation of the Thermal Network Model’s Efficacy
To validate the efficacy of the thermal network model in predicting the temperature
of the 3 MW wind-turbine gearbox, a comparison was made between the model’s output
parameters and the actual steady-state operating parameters from the wind farm’s SCADA
data. For validation, SCADA data from the high-temperature months of June, July, and
August 2021 were selected. Each month, a stable operating day with continuous data points
collected at 10 min intervals was chosen, resulting in a total of 312 data sets for comparison.
Due to the challenges in installing internal sensors in the gearbox, actual data included
only output parameters such as the input-side bearing temperature, output-side bearing
temperature, gearbox oil temperature, and ambient air temperature inside the nacelle.
The gearbox oil temperature and nacelle air temperature were used as input values for
the model, and the output-side bearing temperature served as the data for the valida-
tion and comparison. Figures 7–9 below illustrate the comparison results between the
model’s predicted bearing temperature and the actual SCADA data for the output-side
bearing temperature.

Figure 9. Numerical computations versus SCADA data comparative chart for August. 
Comparing the aforementioned 312 sets of da ta, it is observed that the average error 
falls within the range of 1 to 4 °C. Furthermore, during periods of stable input 
temperatures, the average error narrows to  1 to 2 °C. However, when the input 
temperature undergoes significant changes, the error tends to increase, yet it remains below 4 °C at its maximum. At 11:39, as depi cted in Figure 8, the effective power of the 
turbine drops to 0. At this moment, the temperature deviation reaches its peak for the day, 
reaching 4 °C. Subsequently, the turbine begins to slowly decelerate, and the deviation 
stabilizes within the range of 0 to 2.2 °C. 
Analysis of the potential error sources reveals two main aspects: 
(1) Errors stemming from the node simplifica tion: The thermal network model simplifies 
components like gear bearings into ideal nodes for computation. In practical 
scenarios, heat generation points in bearin g positions may be at the contact points of 
rollers and other components, whereas the thermal network model treats the entire 
bearing node as a heat source. 
(2) Errors arising from the lubrication system simplification: In actual lubrication 
processes, the lubricating oil flows out of the gearbox for secondary cooling. 
Moreover, the lubricating oil temperatures  at different positions in the gearbox 
should be varied, and the oil-spray quantities should be adjusted in real time based 
on the gearbox temperature conditions. However, for computational efficiency, the thermal network model simplifies the lubricating oil temperature and spray parameters as ideal conditions. 
Considering the above, the overall error is within a reasonable range, Furthermore, 
the refinement of the thermal network model at critical research positions can help reduce 
the aforementioned errors. The thermal networ k model proves effective in predicting the 
steady-state temperature of a large-megawatt wind-turbine gearbox in practical 
operations.

5.3. Finite Element Simulation Validation of the Thermal Network Model’s Efficacy
However, comparison with SCADA data can only validate the temperature predic-
tions for the output shaft bearing at this particular node position. Thus, the study of the
internal temperature distribution within the gearbox cannot be verified through compar-
ison with SCADA data alone. Therefore, this paper employs finite element analysis to
analyze the temperatures of the internal gearbox nodes, allowing for a comparative analysis
with the results obtained from the thermal network model. This approach validates the
effectiveness of temperature predictions for other internal nodes. Due to the extensive
computational requirements and high-performance demands on computing resources,
this study focuses solely on the simulation of the steady-state temperature field in the
high-speed gear transmission area where temperatures are elevated.
The purpose of the simulation is to verify the consistency between the steady-state
temperature field within the gearbox and the thermal network model. This encompasses
the temperature distribution and magnitude during steady-state conditions. Given the
omission of dynamic considerations for the rotational motion of gear engagement, the
simulation uniformly distributes the heat generated by gear engagement as a heat flux
on the gear surfaces. Additionally, it applies the theoretically calculated heat flux at
the points of gear engagement. In the thermal network method, bearings are treated as
nodes, simplifying the bearing model to a circular ring, with heat flux applied to the
geometric body. Considering the heat exchange processes between the lubricating oil,
gears, and bearings, convective heat transfer is applied to the outer surface of the bearing,
gear engagement surfaces, and side surfaces, with numerical values based on theoretical
calculations. Material definitions and parameters for the shaft, gears, and bearings were
established, with the initial temperature set at the ambient temperature of 22◦C. The
simulation was conducted for the steady-state temperature field under the operating
conditions specified in Table 6.
As depicted in Figure 10, under various operating conditions, the highest internal

Upon analyzing the results depicted in Figu re 10, it is observed that the average 
temperature at Point 2 exceeds that of the lower temperature positions by 10 °C. This 
temperature disparity suggests the follow ing potential causes for the elevated 
temperatures: The high heat generation at the downwind bearing of the high-speed stage 
stems from the fact that the highest speed in the third-stage transmission resides at the 
output end. Additionally, the downwind bearing bears significant inclined gear meshing 
forces, resulting in heightened heat generati on. Similarly, the temperature of the low-
speed downwind bearing (Point 1) averages 4 to 5 °C higher than that of the upwind 
bearing. Furthermore, the heat generation poin ts in the high-speed section are denser than 
those in the low-speed section, and heat tr ansfers occur between these points, thereby 
elevating the temperature of the high-speed se ction above that of the low-speed section. 
The observed temperature variation trend and distribution align with the results 
obtained from the thermal network model, validating its effectiveness in predicting the overall gearbox temperature. However, the simulated temperatures at each bearing

Analyzing the discrepancies between the simulation and the thermal network model
reveals that in the thermal network model, the bearing is considered a singular node
endowed with a heat source. However, the thermal resistance is computed based on the
actual heat-transfer area of the bearing. In the finite element simulation, the heat source is
uniformly applied to the entire bearing geometry through heat flux, and the convective heat
transfer coefficient is assigned to all bearing outer surfaces based on theoretical calculations.
This results in an average temperature at the bearing position that is lower than that
of the thermal network model. Furthermore, the simulation does not account for the
heat conduction between the housing and various components, leading to an increase in
temperature at some nodes.
Setting the same boundary conditions as the thermal network model in the finite
element simulation is challenging, making it difficult to precisely reflect the temperature
at various nodes in the gearbox. However, the overall temperature distribution trend
aligns with thermal equilibrium principles and corresponds with the results of the thermal
network model. This effectively validates the efficacy of the thermal network model in
predicting the temperature of the 3 MW wind-turbine gearbox.
5.4. Conclusion of Thermal Network Model Verification
Based on the temperature predictions for different operating conditions obtained
from Section 5.1, the analysis reveals that high-temperature nodes within the gearbox are
concentrated in the third stage of the high-speed transmission section. Node 41 and node
15 are identified as the most susceptible locations to high-temperature faults within the
gearbox. Therefore, in the actual process of optimizing gearbox structure and designing
internal lubrication cooling systems, targeted improvements should be made based on the
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

predictive results. Additionally, health monitoring devices should be installed at these
node positions.
In Section 5.2, by juxtaposing the numerical values of the output shaft bearing tem-
perature extracted from the SCADA data of the 3 MW wind-turbine gearbox, the thermal
network model’s accuracy in predicting node temperatures can be corroborated. Further-
more, the data analysis in Section 5.2 indicates that to minimize predictive errors in this
model, it is imperative to analyze the wind turbine when it has reached a stable operational
state or is undergoing gradual changes.
In Section 5.3, by conducting a thorough comparison with the steady-state tempera-
ture field simulation of the high-speed gear transmission using finite element analysis, the
model’s effectiveness in predicting the overall temperature distribution is confirmed. Addi-
tionally, an analysis of the root causes of high temperatures in the nodes of the high-speed
gear transmission section was performed.
In conclusion, the thermal network model presented in this study effectively predicts
the temperature of the gearbox and accurately identifies the precise location of high-
temperature faults within the gearbox. It serves to prevent high-temperature faults and
contributes to reducing the associated cost losses.
6. Exploring the Influence of Oil Injection Parameters on the Steady-State
Temperature Field
The 3 MW wind-turbine gearbox employs both oil-injection lubrication and splash
lubrication methods, with the design of the oil-injection lubrication system playing a pivotal
role in the overall temperature regulation of the gearbox. M. Shuai et al. [ 23] conducted
a study on the convective heat transfer effects of oil-injection lubrication on gears. L.
Ruirui [ 24] analyzed oil-injection lubrication in planetary gear transmissions through
finite element simulation. L. Jiadong and F. Jin [ 25] explored the impact of different oil-
injection aperture sizes and lengths on lubrication effectiveness. These studies collectively
underscore the significance of the oil-injection lubrication system in the gearbox. Therefore,
in establishing the thermal network model, this paper considered the parameters of the
oil-injection lubrication system. After validating the model’s effectiveness, this study
investigated the influence of the oil injection aperture, injection velocity, and injection
angle on the overall gearbox temperature field. The relevant results are presented in
Figures 11–13.
To illustrate the impact of the oil injection system on the steady-state temperature
field of the gearbox, we selected ten nodes significantly influenced by the oil injection
parameters for observation. These ten nodes represent the positions directly subjected
to oil-spray lubrication, or in close proximity to the oil spray. They exhibit the most
significant temperature variations with changes in oil spray parameters, thereby reflecting
the profound impact of oil spray parameters on node temperatures. Based on the results in
Figures 11–13, the nozzle diameter and injection velocity in the oil injection system have a
substantial impact on the gearbox temperature, especially at the gear meshing positions,
where an increased nozzle diameter and injection velocity result in more pronounced
cooling effects, while the injection angle has a relatively minor effect. When designing
the overall oil-injection lubrication and cooling system, it is crucial to comprehensively
consider these three factors. Introducing the designed boundary conditions into the thermal
network model presented in this paper allows for the prediction of relevant results. This
thermal network model provides theoretical support for the optimization and validation of
the cooling and lubrication systems in 3 MW wind-turbine gearboxes, offering a convenient
and efficient computational approach.

7. Conclusions
In this investigation, a thermal network model was constructed to forecast the internal
temperature distribution of a 3 MW wind-turbine gearbox. Predictions of the gearbox
temperature field under various operating conditions were conducted to validate its efficacy.
Additionally, an analysis was performed to assess the impact of oil spray parameters on
the temperature field. The conclusions are summarized as follows:
(1) Under various high-temperature conditions, temperature forecasts for the 3 MW wind-
turbine gearbox revealed a concentrated distribution of internal high-temperature
nodes within the third stage. Node 41 (high-speed downwind bearing—deep groove
ball bearing) stands out as the hottest point within the gearbox, notorious for its
frequent high-temperature failures. Similarly, under substantial input loads, Node 15
(meshing area of first-stage planetary-gear sun gear) experiences elevated tempera-
tures, making it prone to gear failures such as bonding. To avert downtime caused by
high temperatures, it is essential to enhance lubrication and cooling mechanisms at
these critical nodes, optimize mechanical structures, and prioritize the monitoring of
high-temperature failures.
(2) Through comparison with SCADA data, the average error of the thermal network
model in this study ranges from 1 to 4◦C. When the turbine operates steadily, the
average error decreases to 1 to 2◦C. However, significant fluctuations in turbine input
power can lead to increased errors. Hence, for temperature prediction, it is advisable
to analyze the turbine’s operation during stable or gradually changing conditions.
(3) Through analysis of the oil spray parameters, it is evident that the diameter and
velocity of the oil spray significantly impact the internal temperature of the gearbox,
showing a trend where cooling effectiveness increases with the enlargement of these
parameters. Conversely, the spray angle exerts minimal influence on temperature.
Therefore, in designing the oil-spray system, greater emphasis should be placed on
optimizing velocity and diameter parameters, while the spray angle can be tailored
based on gearbox structure for optimal design. Moreover, these parameters can
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

be integrated into the model presented in this paper to validate the optimization
outcomes.
The model offers rapid computation, making it more convenient and versatile com-
pared to data modeling and analysis methods. It enables the swift identification of over-
heating positions within the gearbox, allowing for targeted optimization and maintenance,
thus effectively reducing the frequency and duration of turbine shutdowns caused by over-
heating faults. This endeavor also furnishes a robust computational and validation model
for the design and optimization of cooling and lubrication systems in large-megawatt
wind-turbine gearboxes. This study holds significant industrial value for enterprises by
reducing maintenance and loss costs incurred due to shutdown failures.
