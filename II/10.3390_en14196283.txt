Abstract: A fault diagnosis method for wind turbine gearboxes based on undersampling, XGBoost
feature selection, and improved whale optimization-random forest (IWOA-RF) was proposed for the
problem of high false negative and false positive rates in wind turbine gearboxes. Normal samples
of raw data were subjected to undersampling ﬁrst, and various features and data labels in the raw
data were provided with importance analysis by XGBoost feature selection to select features with
higher label correlation. Two parameters of random forest algorithm were optimized via the whale
optimization algorithm to create a ﬁtness function with the false negative rate ( FNR ) and false positive
rate ( FPR) as evaluation indexes. Then, the minimum ﬁtness function value within the given scope
of parameters was found. The WOA was controlled by the hyper-parameter to optimize the step
size. This article uses the variant form of the sigmoid function to alter the change trend of the WOA
hyper-parameter from a linear decline to a rapid decline ﬁrst and then a slow decline to allow the
WOA to be optimized. In the initial stage, a larger step size and step size change rate can make the
model progress to the optimization target faster, while in the later stage of optimization, a smaller
step size and step size change rate allows the model to more accurately ﬁnd the minimum value of
the ﬁtness function. Finally, two hyper-parameters, corresponding to the minimum ﬁtness function
value, were substituted into a random forest algorithm for model training. The results showed that
the method proposed in this paper can signiﬁcantly reduce the false negative and false positive rates
compared with other optimization classiﬁcation methods.

1. Introduction
Wind power generation [ 1] is of great importance in the clean energy power generation
sector. In recent years, driven by policies of carbon neutrality and carbon emission peaks [ 2],
China has focused on the development of clean energy, in which wind power is one of the
most mature technologies and is expanding in scale [ 3]. However, while the use of wind
turbines is expanding in scale, the number of wind turbine accidents is also increasing [ 4].
Wind turbine faults emerge endlessly due to changeful working conditions and exposure
to the sun, rain, sandstorms, and other severe weather factors throughout the year [ 5]. As
a result, faults such as turbine gearbox faults [ 6], main bearing faults [ 7], and generator
faults [ 8] lead to wind turbine maintenance downtime. Wind turbine maintenance is
difﬁcult and expensive due to high-altitude maintenance operations, which results in the
need for considerable manpower and material resources, and can incur huge economic
losses. For this reason, monitoring and maintenance of wind turbines is of the utmost
importance to avoid secondary damage and reduce the maintenance cost and difﬁculties [ 9].

The wind turbine gearbox [ 10] is an important transmission part, but its fault fre-
quency is at the top of the list. Data [ 11] shows that gearbox faults lead to the longest
maintenance downtime. Common wind turbine gearbox faults occur in gears and bear-
ings [ 12]. A changeable running environment and complex operating conditions [ 13]
lead to the necessary long-term adjustment of the load operation, thus causing excessive
mechanical equipment wear, including wear and pitting corrosion of the gearbox gears,
tooth surface deformation and tooth cracks, and the enhanced possibility of a crack on the
inner ring, outer ring, and cage of the bearing [14].
Machine learning algorithms are widely used in wind turbine fault diagnosis. Xi-
ang [ 15] used the method of convolutional neural network cascading to LSTM (long
short-term memory) network to warn in the event of an abnormal state in wind turbines.
Kordestani [ 16] combined the dynamic principal component analysis (DPCA) with the
support vector machine (SVM) to identify dynamic fault states. Trizoglou [ 17] proposed an
extreme gradient-reinforced model for fault diagnosis of wind turbine gearboxes with bet-
ter prediction accuracy than LSTM and a lower calculation cost. Liu [ 18] proposed a hybrid
model to predict the oil temperature of wind turbine gearboxes. Pan [ 19] utilized the deep
belief network (DBN) and self-organizing map (SOM) to reduce the noise of the sensor’s
characteristic signal and then optimized and improved the particle ﬁlter (PF) algorithm via
the fruit ﬂy optimization algorithm (FOA) to predict the service life of the gearbox. The
above methods improved the accuracy of the model, while simultaneously making the
model more complex, increasing training time, and worsening real-time performance, thus
making the practical application of some of these projects unfeasible.
The random forest (RF) [ 20] algorithm is an extended variant of bagging, and, be-
longing to the integration algorithm, it is simple, easy to implement, requires a lower
computational expense, and has strong classiﬁcation performance. The random forest
algorithm is widely used in machine learning for fault diagnosis. In the ﬁeld of medicine,
Asadi [ 21] used the improved RF to diagnose patients with heart diseases and P . K. P [ 22]
used the RF, subject to bayesian optimization, to realize an accurate classiﬁcation of breast
cancer. In trafﬁc, a mixed method, combining random forest regression and maximum
information coefﬁcient, was used to predict whether a ﬂight would be delayed [ 23]. In
agriculture, Makungwe [ 24] combined the linear mixture model with RF to predict soil pH
range. The RF algorithm, with strong computing power, was used in this paper for the
fault diagnosis of wind turbine gearboxes.
Feature selection [ 25] is necessary to ﬁnd the optimal feature subset, as redundant
features will increase model training time and irrelevant features will reduce the accuracy of
the model in the dataset. Common feature selection methods include Pearson’s correlation
coefﬁcient, chi-square test, XGBoost [ 26], variance selection, mutual information and
maximum information coefﬁcient, etc. In this study, XGBoost feature selection was used to
process the data and identify the correlation between each feature and gearbox fault more
conveniently and intuitively.
An appropriate classiﬁcation algorithm selected for fault diagnosis may not achieve
the expected results. For this reason, the hyper-parameters in the classiﬁcation algorithm
should be adjusted, namely, subject to optimization. Long [ 27] adopted the grey wolf
optimization algorithm and proposed an exploration-enhanced grey wolf optimization
algorithm (EEGWO) [ 28]. Long [ 29] also proposed an enhanced adoptive butterﬂy optimiza-
tion algorithm for PV model parameter identiﬁcation. Tang [ 30] proposed a cost-sensitive
large margin distributor (CLDM) for fault diagnosis of wind turbine generators to reduce
the inﬂuence of data category imbalance, and the cost-sensitive extreme random forest
algorithm (CS-ERF) was proposed [ 31] to further study the fault of wind turbine generators.
In recent years, a large number of researchers have begun to use machine learning
methods to realize the intelligent diagnosis of fan gearbox faults. McKinnon [ 32], using
SCADA data, compared three algorithms of one-class support vector machine (OCSVM),
isolation forest (IF), and elliptical envelope (EE) for the same fault. The average accuracy of
OCSVM was 82%, which was better than IF and EE, but the accuracy of fault classiﬁcation

required improvement. Yang [ 33] proposed a method based on deep joint variational
automatic encoder to detect wind turbine gearbox faults. This method reduced the FNR ,
but the optimization of the FPR was not obvious. Corley [ 34] combined thermal modeling
and machine learning methods to detect gearbox faults. The method had less conclusive
results, which may have affected the accuracy of fault detection. Tang [ 35] improved the
lightGBM method, which solved the problem of low computational efﬁciency and poor
real-time performance of the traditional GBDT algorithm, but there was also a risk that it
would fall into local optimization.
However, there are still some problems to be solved in practical engineering applica-
tions. Overﬁtting and local optimum can easily occur due to the strong capability of the
random forest algorithm. A hyper-parameter fault diagnosis model, based on a random
forest algorithm optimized by WOA, was proposed to solve the problem of ﬁnding the
global optimal parameters of the fault diagnosis model of wind turbine gearboxes, to allow
for improved diagnosis performance of the fault diagnosis model.
The whale optimization algorithm (WOA) [ 36] is a bionic algorithm imitating whale
hunting, which mainly includes three search mechanisms: (1) realizing the local search of
the algorithm via shrinkage encirclement mechanism and (2) spiral mechanism, and (3) the
global search of the algorithm via random learning strategy. With advantages of a simple
process, a fast rate of convergence, and excellent performance in solving optimization
problems, the WOA is widely used in various applications.
This article uses the advantages of WOA and ﬂexibly controls the optimization speed
by changing the hyper-parameters of WOA, and change the location update strategy to
make it more random and reduce the risk of WOA falling into a local optimum. The
hyper-parameters to be optimized in random forest algorithm were substituted into the
improved whale optimization algorithm (IWOA). The optimal value was quickly found
through three search methods, and then the optimal parameter value was returned to RF
for training. Finally, the fault diagnosis was carried out by the trained model.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Random Forest Algorithm
After the bagging integration was created by RF with a decision tree as the base learner,
random feature selection was further introduced into the RF on the basis of the training
degree of the decision-making tree. For attribute selection and partition, the traditional
decision tree selected an optimal attribute among the attributes of the current node, while
the RF randomly selected a subset containing k attributes from the attribute set of the
node on the base decision tree. It then selected an optimal attribute from the subset for
the partition. The substitute of all training subsets was put into different base learners
for training. Each learner’s classiﬁcation results were voted for in a comprehensive way,
and the result with the largest number of votes was the ﬁnal prediction of the RF. Figure 1
showed the ﬂow chart of the random forest algorithm.
The diversity of base learner in the random forest was achieved by sample distur-
bance and attribute disturbance, leading to further improvement of the ﬁnally-integrated
generalization performance due to the increase in the difference degree among individual
learners.
The hyper-parameters of the random forest included the number of the decision in
the forest, the depth of the decision tree, the number of the optimal splitting point features,
the criterion to measure the splitting, and the minimum number of samples on the leaf
node, which directly affect the accuracy of the random forest classiﬁcation and the required
time [ 37]. The number of decision trees and the minimum number of samples on the leaf
node were selected, in this study, via the empirical law for optimization.

2.2. Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) 
Derived through the imitation of whale hunting, WOA [38] is a meta-heuristic 
algorithm based on swarm intelligence, which mainly includes three search mechanisms: 
realizing the local search of the algorithm via shrinkage encirclement mechanism and 
spiral mechanism, and the global search of the algorithm via random learning strategy. It has the advantage of being a simple process with a fast rate of convergence. 
2.2.1. Search Prey Model 
The mathematical model when the whale searches for prey is as follows: 
𝐷=| 𝐶 𝑋
௥௔௡ௗ − 𝑋(𝑡)| , (1) 
𝑋(𝑡+1 )=𝑋 ௥௔௡ௗ −𝐴𝐷, (2) 
t is the current number of training, t ≥ 1; and 𝑋௥௔௡ௗ is the randomly selected whale 
position vector. When 𝐴≥1  in the algorithm, a search lo cation was randomly selected 
to update the position of the other whales to force the whale to deviate from the prey, thereby finding a more appropriate prey. In this case, the exploration ability of the 
algorithm was strengthened so that the WOA could perform a global search.

WOA’s mathematic model to encircle preys is as follows:

tis the current number of training, t1; and Xrandis the randomly selected whale position

the position of the other whales to force the whale to deviate from the prey, thereby
ﬁnding a more appropriate prey. In this case, the exploration ability of the algorithm was
strengthened so that the WOA could perform a global search.

the whale’s moving step length. The value of adecreases curvilinearly from 2 to 0.
2.2.3. Hunting Mathematical Model
In order to reduce the possibility of the model falling into the local optimum, this
article will use the randomness of the parameters in the hunting model to obtain three
random moving positions of the whale, and use the average of these three moving positions
as the next moving position. According to the whale’s spiral movement for hunting, the
mathematic model of the whale’s movement location is as follows:
X1=X(t)+Dp1ebl1cos(2pl1), (8)
X2=X(t)+Dp2ebl2cos(2pl2), (9)
X3=X(t)+Dp3ebl3cos(2pl3), (10)
X(t+1)=X1+X2+X3
3(11)
where Dp=jX(t) X(t)jrepresents the distance between the whale and the prey; bis a
constant to deﬁne the shape of the helix; and lis a random number in (  1, 1). The whale
swims to the prey in a helix with increased curvature. Suppose that it is of probability sto
select the shrinkage encirclement mechanism and 1  to select the spiral mechanism for
updating the whale’s location. The mathematical model is as follows:
X(t+1)=X(t) AD,p<s
X(t+1)=X(t)+Dpeblcos(2pl),ps, (12)
When the whale was going to attack the prey, awas set to decrease when the whale
got closer to the prey in the mathematical model. The ﬂuctuation range also decreased over
’s decrease. When adecreased from 2 to 0 during iteration, Awas a random value within
[ a,a]. When the value of Awas with [ 1, 1], the whale may appear at any position
between its current position and the position of the prey. When A< 1 was set in the
algorithm, the whale attacks the prey.

parameters of the data and model should be adjusted to clean out redundant and irrelevant
features. The hyper-parameters in the diagnostic model should be considered to optimize
the whole model and prevent the model from local optimum and overﬁtting. The ﬂow

of gears, bearings, and transmission shafts. Most faults occur on the gearbox’s gears and 
bearings. The gearbox and other components were monitored by measuring the bearing

sensors. Figure 3 presents the overall system diagram of the wind turbine.

3.2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
With a large amount of data, incomplete, null, and other values in the original data,
due to sensors and for other reasons, may be directly discarded to obtain a non-null dataset.
The wind turbine runs normally the majority of the time, leading to an excess of normal
samples and unbalanced categories. In this paper, the number of normal samples in the
original data was reduced and the number of normal samples and fault samples in the data
was balanced by undersampling. The dataset also contained pitch fault, yaw fault, and
other faults at a certain point in time. This experiment aimed to study the gearbox fault, so
other disturbing fault data was ﬁltered out to obtain a standard single fault and normal
datasets. The data, after the cleaning, was preprocessed for standardization.
Each feature has different sensitivity to different faults of wind turbines. XGBoost was
used to screen all features once in this experiment to select the more important features
more accurately and reduce the complexity of the model.
3.3. Feature Selection
More features does not lead to a higher accuracy of the training in machine learn-
ing [ 39]. On the contrary, a large number of redundant features in the data will not only
affect the classiﬁcation speed of the model, but also affect the classiﬁcation accuracy of the
model and increase the risk of missing and false alarms. XGBoost was used for feature
selection and calculating the features to be split through parallel features. Multiple threads
were used in an attempt to take each feature as the feature to be split and ﬁnd the optimal
splitting point of each feature. The feature with the largest gain was selected as the feature
to be split, after calculation of the gain was generated after splitting.
Table 3 shows the feature importance of each feature obtained after XGBoost feature
selection.

 Figure 4 presents the partial feature import ance after visualization to more clearly 
distinguish the importance of each feature to the tag. 
 
Figure 4. XGBoost partial feature importance. 
From Figure 4, it is evident that the generator power, generator shaft torque, and 
generator inlet oil temperature are the main  factors affecting gearbox faults. Feature 
screening was performed by calculating the impo rtance of each feature. Features with low 
importance affected the accuracy of the model , but also consumed a considerable amount 
of the computing power, causing poor rea l-time performance of the model. For this 
reason, the features that fell below the mean  value of feature importance were discarded 
and those above the mean value were retained. The mean feature importance was 
0.026316, and, thus, 12 feature data were retained. 
3.4. Performance Evaluation Index of Fault Diagnosis 
The unimproved whale optimization algorithm (WOA), particle swarm optimization 
(PSO) [40], and salp swarm algorithm (SSA) were compared with the IWOA-RF to verify 
the effectiveness and superiority of the IWOA-RF in the diagnosis of wind turbine gearbox 
faults. Three random forest models, after optimization and improved whale optimization 
algorithm (IWOA), were substituted into three ne w data to test the reliability of the model. 
The false negative rate ( FNR ) and false positive rate ( FPR) were taken as performance 
evaluation indexes in this paper. FNR  and FPR can be represented in the following form:  
𝐹𝑁𝑅 =ிே

Under the same amount of training, it can be seen from Figure 5a that the average 
FNR  of the unimproved random forest algorithm model exceeds 8%, while the average 
FNR  of PSO-RF, SSA-RF and WOA-RF is about 4% , and the optimization effect is obvious; 
but The FNR  of IWOA-RF is controlled below 2%, which is better than the other three 
optimization methods. It can be seen  from Figure 5b that the average FPR of the five 
models are less than 1%, and the average FPR of PSO-RF, SSA-RF and WOA-RF are all 
higher than 0.5%, and the classification results fluctuate greatly. The performance of the 
optimization of the FPR is unstable, which may be that the algorithm has fallen into a local 
optimum; while the FPR of IWOA-RF is controlled between 0.1% and 0.3%, the FPR is low, 
the fluctuation is small, and the classification effect is better than others Four algorithms.

Comparing Figures 5 and 6, it is clear the general tendency of FNR andFPR of dataset

algorithms. The FNR is controlled below 4%. In Figure 6b, although the average FPR of
SSA-RF is slightly higher than that of IWOA-RF, the ﬂuctuation of FPR of SSA-RF range is
too large. Overall, the classiﬁcation performance of IWOA-RF is better than the other three
optimizations.

TheFPR of all ﬁve models was almost zero, which may result from the fact that the
data quality of dataset 3 was relatively better, with less fault data, leading to a greater

4. Conclusions 
A fault diagnosis method for wind turbine gearboxes based on undersampling, 
XGBoost feature selection, and IWOA-RF was pr oposed in this paper to solve the problem 
of high FNR  and FPR of wind turbine gearboxes. The ma in contributions of this paper are 
as follows: (1) undersampling and XGBoost feature selection were adopted to reduce the 
dimension of the original data and eliminate the negative impact of data category 
imbalance and redundant features on the model; and (2) an optimized Whale optimization algorithm was used to optimize the number of classifiers and th e minimum number of 
samples on leaf nodes in the random fo rest. The IWOA-RF was compared with the 
WOA_RF, PSO-RF, and SSA-RF using three datasets of  FNR  and FPR. The results showed 
that the proposed method can effectively reduce the FNR  and FPR during faul t diagnosis 
under dataset imbalance and ma ny redundancy features. The method proposed in this 
paper was more stable than other optimization methods after the comparison of FNR  and 
FPR.
