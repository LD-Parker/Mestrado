The wind energy industry is continuously improving their operational and maintenance
practice for reducing the levelized costs of energy. Anticipating failures in wind turbines
enables early warnings and timely intervention, so that the costly corrective maintenance
can be prevented to the largest extent possible. It also avoids production loss owing
to prolonged unavailability. One critical element allowing early warning is the ability to
accumulate small-magnitude symptoms resulting from the gradual degradation of wind
turbinesystems.Inspiredbythecumulativesumcontrolchartmethod,thisstudyreports

INTRODUCTION
Wind energy is among the fastest-growing renewable energy sources. The year of 2020 has
been marked as the biggest year ever with a record 93 GW of new installation ( GWEC, 2021 ).
IEA (2020) predicted that over 2023-25, average annual wind energy additions could range from
65 to 90 GW. Adding to the growth, it was also reported that wind energy has become more cost
competitive as indicated by a decreasing trend of the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) ( IEA, 2020 ;
U.S. Department of Energy, 2021 ;GWEC, 2021 ).AsignificantportionofLCOEisrelatedtoturbine
performance (availability and production) and reliability; for instance, Dao et al. (2019) reported a
strong and nonlinear relationship between wind turbine reliability and operations and maintenance
(O&M) cost. The better the reliability and performance, the lower the LCOE. The challenge is how
to keep the O&M cost low while maintaining a desired level of performance and reliability.
Detecting a component failure relies on identifying anomalies or specific patterns in a dataset.
The most commonly used data inputs for anomaly detection in wind turbines are those from
the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system ( Leite et al., 2018 ), failure logs,
vibration ( Natili et al., 2021 ;Pang et al., 2021 ), and occasionally particle counts, status logs, and

maintenance records. Chapter 12 of Ding (2019) explains the
two major schools of thought of fault diagnosis and anomaly
detection: a statistical learning-based approach ( Orozco et al.,
2018;Vidal et al., 2018 ;Ahmed et al., 2019 ;Moghaddass and
Sheng, 2019 ;Ahmed et al., 2021b ;Ahmed et al., 2021 ;Xiao et
al., 2022 ), including control chart approaches ( Hsu et al., 2020 ;
Riaz et al., 2020 ), and physical model-based approach ( Guo and
Keller, 2020 ). There are naturally approaches combining the two
schools of thought ( Yampikulsakul et al., 2014 ;Guo et al., 2020 ;
Hsuetal.,2020 ;YucesanandViana,2021 ).Inthisstudy,wefocus
on the statistical learning-based approaches.
Depending on the availability of data labels in a training
set, statistical learning-based approaches can be categorized
as supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning
needs appropriately labeled data to train a predictive model,
which, once a future input is given, predicts whether the future
instance is a fault/failure event. Least-squares support vector
regression (LS-SVR) ( Yampikulsakul et al., 2014 ), support vector
machine or regression ( Vidal et al., 2018 ;Natili et al., 2021 ),
random forest ( Hsu et al., 2020 ;Pang et al., 2021 ), XG-Boost and
long short-term memory (LSTM) networks ( Desai et al., 2020 ;
Xiao et al., 2022 ) are examples of this category. Labeling the
training data can be challenging because the fault tags are often
added manually. Labeling the training data can also be tricky.
Usually, the data point corresponding to the failure instance is
labeled as a failure and all else are labeled as normal. Consider
the typical SCADA data that are recorded every 10 min. What
such labeling means is that one of the 10-min data point is
labeled as faulty or a failure, and the data points even only
10 min before and after being labeled as normal. But is this
a good labeling practice? Since the failures are relatively rare,
what such labeling generates is highly imbalanced data, causing
many off-the-shelf statistical learning methods to render weak
detection ( Byon et al., 2010 ;Pourhabib et al., 2015 ). If more data
pointsthanthoseatthefailureinstancearetobelabeled,thenthe
questions of how many and which data points should be labeled
arise but are hard to address. Some work ( Desai et al., 2020 ;
Williams et al., 2020 ) choose to label additional data points prior
to the failure instance—so far such action remains ad hoc.
When the data label is not available, unsupervised
learning is the appropriate approach for anomaly detection.
Unsupervised learning relies on the structure or pattern of
the dataset to separate any anomalies from the normal data
(Wang et al., 2012 ). One recent developed approach is based on
the minimum spanning tree-based distance ( Ahmed et al., 2019 ;
Ahmed et al., 2021b ;Ahmed et al., 2021 ), which works based
on the connectedness of data points with their neighbor and
identifies anomalies that are sufficiently different from the
majority of its neighbors. Ahmed et al. (2019) demonstrated
the application of such an unsupervised learning approach for
anomaly detection in hydropower turbines.
In a real-world problem, there is another category approach,
referred to as one-class classification ( Park et al., 2010 ) or semi-
supervisedlearning,orinotherwords,inbetweenthesupervised
and unsupervised approach. The one-class classification uses
only the data under normal operating conditions. This could
be because for a turbine, no failure has been recorded yet,or a small number of failures were recorded but the analysts
felt they would be better off not using the failure event
data. In this case, one can train a model on the normal
data and test whether a future observation conforms with
the established normalcy. If not, then such an observation
is classified as an anomaly. Yampikulsakul et al. (2014) offers
one such approach, as they used the residuals from the
modeled normal data to determine abnormality. Technically, the
control chart-based methods ( Hsu et al., 2020 ;Riaz et al., 2020 ;
Xu et al., 2020 ;Dao, 2021 ;Dao, 2022 ) fall into this
category.
Despite the advancement in statistical learning and fault
detection, most of the fault detection methods mentioned earlier
do not accumulate small-magnitude early symptoms effectively
over time for symptom tracking. As stated earlier, the current
approaches respond to a given event individually, classifying it
- as faulty or non-faulty; such approaches are known as point-
wise detection . The lack of symptoms accumulation and tracking
explainswhythecurrentfaultdetectionsystemshaveverylimited
early warning capability.
Motivated by the desired capability for symptom
accumulation and tracking, we noticed one quality-control
method, known as the cumulative sum (CUSUM) method
(Page, 1954 ;Page, 1961 ).CUSUMisamemory-typecontrolchart
and particularly noted for its ability to accumulate consecutive
sample points in a process over time and thus effectively detect
a small shift in the process that memoryless methods would
otherwise fall short of detecting.
Even though CUSUM is a well established approach, it is not
easy to apply it to turbine failure detection. The implementation
on the complex turbine SCADA data would require some major
modification. For this purpose, Dao (2021) adapted a CUSUM-
basedapproachthatweretypicallyusedtoteststructuralchanges
in economic and financial time series data. The approach
cumulated the standardized residuals after the generator speed
is fit through a linear mode and then used the residuals to
establish the monitoring chart, of which the control limits were
approximated as a function of the data size. This CUSUM-
based approach was reported to detect two known failures just
a few minutes before the failures took place. Xu et al. (2020)
designed an adaptive CUSUM chart to monitor the residuals
after the bearing temperature is fit through a random forest
model. The alarms from the adaptive CUSUM were issued daily
instead of every 10 min to reduce the alarm frequency, but
there was not reporting that how early the failures could be
detected.
Similarly inspired by the concept and method of CUSUM,
we set out to develop a symptom-accumulating method for fault
detection with early warning capability. We targeted weeks ahead
detection rather than minutes or hours ahead. But the plain
CUSUM (also referred to as the vanilla version of CUSUM)
is not effective in handling the complexities associated with a
wind turbine system. The new method needs to address the four
specific questions:
•Which fault signals to accumulate? The plain CUSUM
accumulates the raw measurements, or its sample average.

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Latiffianti et al. Gearbox Early Warning Through CUSUM
Our research shows that for the turbine SCADA data
in a high-dimensional space, accumulating the raw
measurements or its sample average is not effective.
•The use of an offset. What is actually accumulated is the
difference between the anomaly score and an offset value,
rather than the anomaly score itself. The offset value is used
to prevent the accumulation of background noises. This is
theaspectthatthenewmethodremainsthesameastheplain
CUSUM method, but the way to choose the offset will be
different.
•How long to accumulate? In the plain CUSUM method,
the accumulation is allowed until the instance of failure
events. Should we do the same for turbine fault detection,
it will cause too many false positives. We therefore set an
accumulation window size to balance the two types of error
in detection (i.e., false positives versus false negatives).
•Setting the control limit. The control limit is also known as
the decision threshold. In the plain CUSUM method, the
control limit is chosen for producing the desirable average
run length performance metric. In our design, we need to
link the decision outcomes with the monetary gains and
losses associated with the detection performance metrics,
specifically, the true positives, false positives, and false
negatives.
To demonstrate and evaluate the proposed approach, we
implement the approach on real wind turbine datasets with a
focus on gearbox failures. It is not surprising that the gearbox
is chosen for the demonstration purpose as it is the most
popular component to investigate ( Guo et al., 2020 ;Guo and
Keller, 2020 ;Mauricio et al., 2020 ;Liu et al., 2021 ). Not only
has it been one of the components that contribute most to
turbinedowntime( Pinar Pérez et al., 2013 ;Tchakoua et al., 2014 ;
Pfaffel et al., 2017 ;Dao et al., 2019 ;Liu et al., 2021 ), but the
replacement cost is also prohibitively high ( Liu et al., 2021 ).
The rest of the article is organized as follows. Introduction
explains the dataset used in this study. Introduction provides
details about the proposed method, i.e., the answer to the
aforementioned four questions. Introduction presents the
implementation, results, interpretations, and analysis concerning
the proposed method. Finally, Introduction summarizes this
work.
DATA
The data we use in this work are retrieved from an online open
data source ( EDP, 2018b ). An account registration is required
but such registration is free. Except for the dataset about thegeographical location of the turbines, all of the datasets from the
open data source, including all that we used, are granted a free
use CC-BY-SA license.
The open source provides SCADA datasets of five wind
turbines from the same wind farm with a 2-years time span,
which include: a set of signals recorded from the wind turbines,
a set of meteorological tower data, a failures log, and a status
log. The datasets were collected from January 2016 through
December 2017. All these files are provided with the Wind Farm
onetag on the file names. They are split into 2016 and 2017 data.
The five wind turbines in the data are named as T01, T06, T07,
T09, and T11. All turbines belong to the same model in a 2-
MW class with a three-stage planetary/spur gearbox. The cut-in,
rated, and cut-out wind speeds are 4 m/s, 12 m/s, and 25 m/s,
respectively.
We mainly use signals from wind turbines and the failures
log for the analysis. These data are of good quality, as there are
only a few missing values. The 2-years recorded signals from five
turbines are stored in. csv files, forming a table that comprises
521,784 rows and 83 columns when combined together.
The rows are the time series. With a 10-min time resolution,
the number of data points per turbine per year is 52,560 without
any missing values. For five turbines and 2 years, the total data
amount would ideally be 525,600. The actual records of 521,784
account for slightly over 99% of the ideal total data.
The83columnsincludetheturbineID,thetimestamp,and81
environmental(outsidethenacelle)andturbinecondition(inside
the nacelle) variables. The environmental variables include wind
speed, ambient temperature, wind direction, among others,
whereas the condition variables include turbine component
temperature, speed of the rotating components, active power,
etc. The 81 variables are not all physically distinct. Some are
associated with the same physical attribute but provides different
statistics,suchastheaverage,minimum,maximumandstandard
deviation of wind speed in the 10-min periods.
Among the 521,784 records over 2 years, there are a total of
28 failures recorded in the log file. The source of failures varies
but it can be grouped based on the components, i.e., generator,
generator bearing, gearbox, transformer, and hydraulic group.

The datasets were previously given as part of two open
challenges: The EDP Wind Turbine Failure Detection Challenge
2021 and Hack the Wind 2018. The turbine signals data were
very clean and well organized. As part of the 2021 Challenge,
we were supposed to take the data as is. Only some basic data
cleaning were performed such as removing all the missing values
and checking whether data values are within reasonable physical
ranges. No other information was provided to us (e.g., how the
data provider pre-processed their data is unknown). We did
downsize the data resolution from 10-min to 1-h averages and
normalize the data prior to the implementation of our proposed
method.
METHODS
Let us first quickly recap how CUSUM works, which offers the
blueprint for the design of our proposed method.
Consider a CUSUM control chart for detecting a change in
process mean. Denote by μ0the baseline mean. The input signal
is the sample observation, denoted by xtat time t. At any given
time,asmallsampleofmultiple xt’s,sayfiveofthem,areobserved.
Then the sample average, xt, is computed and used as the input
value to a CUSUM chart. The sample size is denoted by n. When
n=1,i.e.,atanygiventime,asingleobservationismade,thenthe
sampleaverageisthesameastheoriginalobservation,i.e., xt=xt.
Thisn=1circumstancerepresentsthemajorityofthecaseswhen
CUSUM is applied. Taking xt, the CUSUM method computes a
score, through the CUSUM formula,
Ct=max{0,Ct−1+[xt−μ0−K]}, (1)
where Kis the offset, and the initial condition, C0, is set to zero.
The standard CUSUM separates the upward change from the
downward change and thus put a superscript “+” on the above
CUSUM score, i.e., C+
t, and create a slightly modified formula for
C−
tfor downward detection.
Apparently, the CUSUM score, Ct, accumulates the difference
ofxt−μ0andK, where xt−μ0is the fluctuation of the process
around its baseline mean. To detect, a control limit His imposed.
Thescore, Ct,iscomparedwith H,andanalarmistriggeredwhen
Ctexceeds H. The two parameters, HandK, are the so-called
design parameters of a CUSUM method, which are chosen using
the training data. The training data are considered all in control,
so that the CUSUM method falls in the category of one-class
classification or semi-supervised learning.Our CUSUM-inspired method follows the same procedure,
but we need to provide our unique and specific solutions to the
four questions raised in Methods .Figure 1 illustrates the overall
flow.
1.What is used as the anomaly score?
Denote the turbine data matrix as Xm×p≔{xtj}where
t=1,…,m,j=1,…,p, and for the whole dataset m=521,784
andp=83. For the training data, its mis about 80% of the
whole dataset. At any time point, we have a single observation
of dimension p, denoted by xt≔(xt1,xt2,…,xtp)T.
Thisxtcannot be directly plugged into Eq 1, because Eq 1
is for a univariate detection, meaning that the xtherein is of
dimension p=1. We acknowledge the existence of multivariate
CUSUM,whichisofthesameconceptandusesasimilarformula
astheunivariateCUSUMbutcantakeinamultivariateinput,i.e.,
a vector of xt.
Using a multivariate CUSUM does not produce good
detection outcomes for turbine failure detection. When we
looked into the reasons behind, we think that one previous
research provided the explanation. Ahmed et al. (2019) argued
that in a multidimensional data space, anomaly and fault
detection should not use Euclidean distances to differentiate
data instances, because there is a high likelihood that the
multidimensional data space embeds a manifold, known as
the manifold hypothesis ( Fefferman et al., 2016 ). In fact, the
existence of manifold is rather ubiquitous and confirmed
in many applications since its discovery in computer vision
(Tenenbaum et al., 2000 ). A manifold is an inherent data
structure restricting the reachability of data instances between
each other. When such manifold embedding happens, the use of
Euclidean distance is no longer appropriate and could mislead
a detection system. Methods ofDing (2019) presents a detailed
account of various distance metrics used in differentiating data
instances in statistical machine learning. Methods specifically
presents an illustration of how Euclidean distance mis-
characterizes the similarity between data instances, thereby
leading to wrong detection.
In the multivariate CUSUM, the distance matric used is
the statistical distance (explained in detail in Methods in
Ding (2019) ), which is a variant of Euclidean distance. For
multidimensional data space embedding manifold, using the
statistical distance suffers the same problem as using the
Euclidean distance.
The solution for addressing this problem is to use a geodesic
distance. But the geodesic distance is not always directly
computable but can often be approximated by some other means.

Latiffianti et al. Gearbox Early Warning Through CUSUM
Ahmed et al. (2019) propose to use the minimum spanning tree
(MST) to approximate the geodesic distance. They argued that
using MST provides one of the best approximations because
of two good properties of MST— minimum ensures the tightest
distance and spanning implies ergodicity. They demonstrate,
using 20 benchmark datasets and comparing them with 13
existing methods, a clear advantage of using the MST-based
anomaly detection method.
Therefore, we choose to adopt the MST approach for our
anomaly score calculation. The detailed procedure is explained
inMethods ofDing (2019) , so we will not repeat it here.
Also,Ahmed et al. (2019) makes their computer code available
(Ahmed et al., 2021a ), which facilitates the implementation of
the MST-based anomaly score computing algorithm. The
computer code includes the construction of the MST on a given
dataset, so that users do not need to construct the MST by
themselves, either.
If we treat the MST-based anomaly score computing
procedure as a black box, the input to the black box is the
multivariate vector xtand the output of the box is a univariate
anomaly score. Note that using the EDP data for computing
the anomaly score, we use the combined data from all five
turbines together. Let us denote the anomaly score by zt, which
is normalized to take a value between 0 and 1. A greater score
implies a higher possibility for a data point to be anomalous.
There are a few variants of the MST-based anomaly score due to
the continuous development on this topic ( Ahmed et al., 2021b ;
Ahmed et al., 2021 ). The specific variant we used for turbine
fault detection is the Local MST (LoMST) originally proposed
byAhmed et al. (2019) and again exhibited in Chapter 12 of
Ding (2019) .
2.How long to accumulate and set the offset?
Here we discuss the second and third questions together.
Like all point-wise detection methods reviewed in Section 1 ,
the MST-based methods and its variants ( Ahmed et al., 2019 ;
Ahmed et al., 2021b ;Ahmed et al., 2021 ) do not do symptom
accumulation. For this reason, it does not include an offset. The
concept of accumulation window does not apply, either.
As shown in Eq 1, the offset, K, is explicitly included in
CUSUM. On the other hand, CUSUM does not explicitly impose
an accumulation window size. CUSUM is designed to detect
simple changes like a mean shift. It is the fluctuation around
the mean, xt−μ0, less the offset K, that gets accumulated. This
value can be positive or negative. When xt−μ0−Kis negative
for multiple steps, it could turn Ctto zero, which is known
as a reset. With this reset mechanism, CUSUM allows its
score to continuously accumulate without manually setting the
accumulationwindowsize.Thedurationwhen Ctisnon-negative
canbenaturallyconsideredasthe de facto accumulationwindow.
The wind turbine failure detection is far more complicated
than a mean shift detection. It is challenging to know around
which baseline its anomaly score ztfluctuates. This means that
its counterpart of μ0is difficult to decide. What we propose to
do is to take a direct difference between ztandK, i.e.,zt−K. But
because K,asanoffset,isusuallysmallerthan zt,zt−Ktendstobe
positive and does not create the reset mechanism as in CUSUM.
If we let zt−Kcontinue accumulating, the accumulation willalmost always exceed the control limit, once given sufficient
time, leading to too many false positives. Because of this, for
our detection method, we impose an explicit accumulation
window size, denoted by W, so that the accumulation
resets when reaching to the limit of the accumulation
window.
We propose to choose the offset Kbased on the probability
distribution of the anomaly scores. The basic idea is as follows.
In the absence of anomalous events, one anticipates a natural
fluctuation in the anomaly scores, more or less like a normal
distribution.Whentheactualanomalyscoredistributionexhibits
a long tail going beyond the natural fluctuation, the anomaly
scorescorrespondingtothelongtailaredeemedtrulyanomalous,
whereas the normal distribution-like portion, symmetric with
respect to the average, is considered to correspond to the
background noise. Figure 2 illustrates the idea. The vertical
dashedlineisthechosenoffset,whichseparatesthedensitycurve
into two parts—the blue part is for the background noises and
the red part is for anomalies. The offset is chosen, so that the
blue density curve is roughly symmetric and the curve beyond
that point becomes almost flat. This selection approach needs
visual judgement, so it does entail a certain degree of subjectivity.
In this regards, it bears resemblance to the scree plot, which is
used to select the number of principal components in a principal
component analysis (PCA) ( Jolliffe, 2002 ). The scree plot is also a
graph plot based tool that needs a visual judgement to decide on
the particular value to choose. Despite such subjectivity, it is still
nonetheless the most widely used tool for deciding the number
of principal components.
The accumulation window size Wwill be chosen by making
use of the training data. A number of considerations include how
many clusters are produced, how distinguishable the clusters are
based on the distance between them, and how many clusters
actually predict the true failures in the training data. True
positives way ahead of a failure event is most desirable. In
practice, a certain number of false positives may be tolerated in
exchangefordetectingthetruefailureeventsoverthecasesoffew
false positives but many missed detections, because the cost of a
misseddetectionexceedsbyalargemarginthatofafalsepositive.

particular analysis.

The specific trade-off between these cost components is to be
optimized using a cost/savings utility function, to be discussed
in the sequel.
3.How to set the control limit?
Todeterminethecontrollimit,wemakeuseoftheinformation
from the failure log to tag the failure time and then use the
training data to optimize the control limit. Different from the
plain CUSUM chart that optimizes their average run length
performance, we adopt a utility function that connects the failure
detection performance with monetary gains and losses. The basic
ideaistochooseacontrollimitthatmaximizesthetruedetection,
while at the same time regulating the number of false positives at
anacceptablelevel.Autilityfunctionisanobjectivefunctionthat
unifies the gains and losses from different actions. The specific
utility function is adopted from an open challenge— Hack the
Wind 2018 (EDP, 2018a )—for its practical relevance and realistic
monetary parameters (as it is set by a major wind company). We
believe the functionadopted bearsgeneral applicability, although
the specific monetary parameters may be adjusted for particular
owners/operators and applications.
Three detection possibilities are considered: true positives
(TP), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). When a true
detection happens, a potential saving is in order. The saving
amount is related to how early such warning can be issued.
Therefore, the TP saving is set in the Hack the Wind 2018
challenge as
TPsaving=∑
i=1,…,#TP(Rcost−Mcost)(Δti
60), (2)where #TP is the number of true positives, RcostandMcostare the
replacement and maintenance costs (also known as repair cost),
respectively, and Δ tiis the number of days ahead of the failure
time.Thesavingsfunctionin Eq 2assumesthat60 daysbeforethe
failure event is where the maximum savings can be achieved. The
savings decreases as the detection happens closer to the instance
of the failure.
When a false negative happens, it means a miss detection.
Then, the cost is the replacement cost, which is the most costly
option. When a false detection happens, the consequence is an
inspection cost, denoted by Icost. As such, the FN and FP cost
components are, respectively,
FNcost=#FN×Rcost,
FPcost=#FP×Icost,(3)
where #FN and #FP are the number of the false negatives and
false positives, respectively. The utility function, U(H), combines

In the Hack the Wind 2018 challenge, the early warning is
assumed up to 60 days in advance. In our study, we extend
it to 90 days in advance. This extension is mainly because the
source of failures in a wind turbine gearbox varies, from one
that is temporary and random to a wear-out failure due to a
longtime running in poor working conditions ( Liu et al., 2021 ).

Latiffianti et al. Gearbox Early Warning Through CUSUM
The extension is expected to capture this wear-out type of failure.
When a failure is not detected before the event, it is considered
to be a false negative. When an alarm is issued but with no
corresponding failure in the dataset, it is considered to be an FP.
In the Hack the Wind 2018 challenge, a detection within 2 days
of the failure event is also considered a miss detection, or an FN,
as it is too close to the failure event to prevent the failure from
happening. We keep the same treatment in this study.
Additional Remarks
As a summary, our CUSUM-inspired failure detection method
entails the following main steps:
1)Compute the anomaly scores for all data points of interest;
both training and test sets.
2)Subtract the offset value from the raw anomaly scores, so as
to flag only those data points with high anomaly scores as
anomalies.
3)Use the training data to determine the accumulation
window, a maximum time between two consecutive
anomaly data points of which the anomaly scores are to
be accumulated.
4)Again use the training data to optimize for the control limit

turbines, but the concept and method remain the same.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Weimplementourproposedmethodaimingatdetectinggearbox
failures in wind turbines. In this section, we start off explaining
further implementation details and the parameters chosen in the
proposeddetectionmethod.Afterthat,wewilldiscusstheresults
and evaluate the performance of the method.
Implementation Details and Parameters
Priortotheimplementationoftheproposedmethod,weperform
data preprocessing and variables selection. The data is originally
a 521,784 ×83 matrix. We downsize the number of rows by
aggregating data from their original 10-min temporal resolution
to 1-h averages. This preprocessing reduces the number of
rows to 87,052 for all five turbines, or about 17,400 rows per
turbine.
Variables selection is important for screening the available
variables into a smaller set of meaningful and highly relevant
variables. We conducted various tests to reduce variables that
have a high collinearity with other variables. In the end, we
select a subset that consists of gearbox oil temperature, gearbox
bearing temperature, nacelle temperature, rotor speed, ambient
wind direction, and active power. We perform our detection
method, as explained in Implementation Details and Parameters ,
on the data with this subset of variables.The LoMST anomaly score is computed using the code
provided by Ahmed et al. (2021a) . In producing the LoMST
scores, a local neighborhood size is needed; for that we use
25, which is an empirical choice. The rest of the parameters
used in the detection method are: 1) the offset K=0.3 2) the
accumulation window size, W=7 days, and 3) the control limit,
H=8. In deciding H, the following cost parameters are used in
the utility function: Rcost=€100,000, Mcost=€20,000, and Icost=
€5,000. These cost parameters are taken from the Hack the Wind
2018challenge ( EDP, 2018a ).
Results
Figure 4 presents the results from the implemented method on
the dataset. Recall that there are four gearbox failures recorded
within the 2-years time span—two are in the training set and the
other two are in the test set. All four failures can be detected by
the proposed method.
Table 2 presents the time of alarm of the gearbox failures
based on the results in Figure 4 . The early-warning lead time,
measuredbythealarm-to-failuretime,rangesfrom21to89 days.
The average warning lead time based on the training set is
55 days. We also took a close look at the nature of the gearbox
failures. Recall that Liu et al. (2021) classified the faults in the
wind turbine gearbox into two categories: the wear-out failures
andtemporaryrandomfaults.Notefurther,from Table 2 ,thatthe
first and fourth failures are caused by gearbox pump and noise,
the second failure’s source is not known, and the third is from
the gearbox bearing. A bearing failure is typically a wear-out type
that builds up slowly. Our method successfully anticipates this
failure,with89-daysleadtime.Thesecondfailureismostlikelyof
the similar type, but we do not have adequate information, based
on the failure remark in the dataset, to be assertive one way or
the other. The other two failures—the pump and the noise—are
closer to temporary random faults. The lead times of detection
are shorter than 60 days.
Method Evaluation
Ourproposedmethodworkswellinanticipatinggearboxfailures
on the given data. Since the method does produce both false
positives,inadditiontothetruedetection,weshouldevaluatethe
final performance of the method using the total savings formula
inEq 4.
Table 3 presents the savings calculations, as a result of
detection performance metrics. We present two scenarios: one
usesacommoncontrollimitandtheotherusesindividualcontrol
limits for each turbine. Following the approach that decides the
common control limit for all turbines, the turbinewise control
limit could be decided as: 8, 10.5, 18.8, 15.5, and 22 for T01,
T06, T07, T09, and T11, respectively. Recall that the common
controllimitis8.Itturnsoutthatthecommoncontrollimitworks
better. It does not have any miss detection, i.e., #FN = 0. As a
result,theexpectedsavingsforthetestdataisapositive€130K.By
comparison, using the turbinewise control limits would miss one
true gearbox failure in the test data and would therefore result in
a negative €25K test case savings, or equivalent, a €25K expense
for the test cases.

The analysis presented in Table 3 also reaffirms an important
message we articulated earlier, which is that detecting a true
failure is far more beneficial than reducing a few additional false
positives. If we look at the number of false positives (column
#FP) inTable 3 , we can see that using the turbinewise control
limits is very good at reducing the number of false alarms. Yet,the one missing detection costs much more than reducing three
falsepositivesinthetestdata.Thisisexpected,asthereplacement
cost, the consequence of a missed detection, is twenty times of
the inspection cost, the consequence of a false positive. This cost
imbalance is generally true, although the specific numerical ratio
depends on applications.

 PCA-based feature selection 2 11 0 €71,666.67
To evaluate the merit of the proposed CUSUM-LoMST
method, we compare it with the following alternatives:
•Pointwise LoMST. This is the original LoMST method
without accumulation.
•Traditional CUSUM, based on ( Dao, 2021 ). This is the
CUSUM without using the LoMST score and other
modifications made in this paper.
•Correlation-based feature selection, before applying the
proposed CUSUM-LoMST method.
•PCA-based feature selection, before applying the proposed
CUSUM-LoMST method.
Thethirdandfourthalternativesintheabovelistaresuggested
by one of the reviewers for testing whether different feature
selection approaches could help improve the performance of
the proposed CUSUM-LoMST method. The correlation-based
feature selection is based on ( Castellani et al., 2021 ), which is to
include the features that have a high Pearson correlation score
FIGURE 5 |An example of CUSUM plot based on the method in
(Dao, 2021 ). The time axis is in the unit of 10 min, as the method in
(Dao, 2021 ) uses 10-min data. This plot covers the first quarter (3 months) of
the data. In this particular set of data, the plot goes outside the control limit
twice; once went out of the lower limit and once of the upper limit. After
going up beyond the upper limit at around 5000thdata point, the plot almost
consistently stays above the line.with the gearbox speed and gearbox bearing temperature. The
PCA-based feature selection is to use the first few significant
principal components of the features selected by using the
Pearson correlation score.
Table 4 presentsthefailuredetectionresultsandtherespective
savings. From the results we can see that the two alternative
feature selection approaches do not help in this case. Their
main shortcoming is that they produce more false alarms
as compared to the proposed approach. On a positive note,
both feature selection approaches still yield positive savings
on the test data, as they are able to detect the two true
failures.
The pointwise LoMST and the tradition CUSUM method do
not perform well. The principal problem of the pointwise LoMST
isitsinabilitytodetectthetruefailuresonthetestdata.Thisisnot
surprising, as from the get-go, our argument is that the pointwise
methods would miss the failure events without accumulating
the signals. The traditional CUSUM method ( Dao, 2021 ) was
able to successfully detect the true failures in the test data but
did so at the expense of producing a lot more false alarms.
In fact, traditional CUSUM produced more false alarms than
all other alternatives in comparison. Figure 5 presents a small
section (the last quarter of Year 1) of the CUSUM plot. We
notice that the plot suffers from seasonal effect and it has to be
reset several times; otherwise the CUSUM score will stay outside
the control limits for very long time. The high number of false
alarms eventually forces the traditional CUSUM method to enter
the region of economic loss (or negative savings) on the test
data.
CONCLUSION
We propose a method that combines the use of LoMST and
a CUSUM approach for detecting anomalies and failures. This
method is applied to 2 years’ worth of wind turbine data
for detecting gearbox failures in wind turbines. Compared
to pointwise detection methods without accumulation or

a traditional CUSUM method without adaptation to the
wind turbine specifics, the proposed CUSUM-LoMST method
producesbetterdetectionoutcomesandlongerleadtime,leading
to more savings to the industry.
Through this study, we would like to offer the following
insights:
•Correctly detecting true failure events with sufficient lead
time is far more important than keeping the number of false
alarms low. This is not to say that reducing false alarms is
not important. But a detection method that does not detect
is practically useless. Until the day when one reaches the
ideal state of having both high detection rates and low false
positive rates, the emphasis should be prioritized towards
detection capability.
•Accumulating small-magnitude symptoms is key to
enable early-warning capability. But the very action of
accumulation exacerbates the delicate trade-off between
true detections, false positives, and false negatives, which
means that accumulation-capable methods need a careful
design to strike the right balance.
•For the detection in a multidimensional space, selecting
the right variables and reducing them further into a scalar
anomaly score for accumulation is a challenging job, but
the final detection performance depends heavily on such
choices. Our proposed use of the MST-based anomaly
scores appears advantageous, at least for the data we
tested. But we acknowledge that on this aspect much more
researchisneededtomakethetreatmentsystematicandless
subjective.
We did apply the proposed CUSUM-LoMST detection
method to other faults in the EDP Open Data, which
includes those from transformer, generator, generator bearing,
and hydraulic groups. In those detections, our proposed
method remains strong in terms of detection power, but the
number of false alarms increases too fast, overwhelming the
benefit of the detections and sometimes tipping the balance
over toward an overall loss. Continuing the improvement
so that the right balance of true detections and false
alarms can be reached is indeed our ongoing research
pursuit.
