ABSTRACT  
This paper proposes a method for obtaining several health 
condition indicators for wind turbines based on vibration data 
driven from two similar experimental tur bines (damaged and 
healthy). The se indicators are able to capture the bearing and 
gear condition of the gearbox in the wind turbines. Signal 
processing and feature extraction were carrie d out –on both 
the time and frequency domains – from raw data in order to 
generate datasets for each shaft of power of the wind turbines.  
Based on good health condition data, a data mining approach 
was used to build two reference models for the indicators, one 
using Self -Organizing Maps (SOM) and another one using 
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). These reference patterns 
for the indicators we re tested with a dataset coming from a 
damaged wind turbine and the results obtained confirmed the 
adequacy of these indicators to  detect anomalies in the health 
condition of a wind turbine.  
1. INTRODUCTION  
Maintenance costs are an important point to take into account 
in renewable energies in g eneral, and in  wind electrical 
generation in particular  (IRENA, 2012).  Current wind 
turbines are designed to work around 120 000 hours a year, 
over a 20 -year lifetime. On average, associated costs  with 
maintenance imply a proportion of the total investment of 
approximately 3%.  
Although both failure type and nature range widely, 
mechanical wind turbine damage has greater incidence 
during downtime periods  than any other fa ult type  (Spinato, 
2009) . The b asic requirements for wind turbine supervision 
have bee n usually formulated ( DNVGL, 2016 ) based on their 
rolling elements condition (drivetrain, gears and bearings). In 
fact, these are considered to be representative enough o f the 
wind turbine health condition. In the area of vibration 
monitoring , the present wind industry is focuse d on 
predictive vibrati on-based maintenance, whose use fulness has been experimentally proven and has turned into standard 
turbine equipment.  
Curren tly, the state -of-art of vibration signal characterization 
covers a wide number of techniques, on both time domain 
(statistical parameters, synchronous averaging) and 
frequency domain (Fourier Transforms, order analysis, 
envelope analysis, cepstrum, etc), which both turn out to be 
particularly useful when pre dicting bearing and gear damage  
(Kalista 2015, Hussain 2013, Sasmal 2015) . Their application 
to wind turbines is very extended.  On the other hand, some 
advanced techniques related to predictive mainten ance, 
among other, are based on machine learning algorithms, 
whose application allows for the prediction of potential 
faults. These can be summarized in to two types: supervised 
(decision trees, K -Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector 
Machine, etc) and non -supervised (k -means, GMM, SOM, 
etc), all of which have been broadly used in wind turbine 
condition monitoring and prognostics (Coronado 2015, 
Tchakoua 2014). This paper serves as  a contribution in this 
field proposing a methodology for the estimation of two 
health condition indicators of a wind turbine gearbox based 
on its vibrational performance.  
The paper is organized as follows:  Section 2 describes the 
methodology proposed. Section 3 presents the source of 
information used in the paper. Section 4 shows the procedure 
followed to transform the raw data collected in a more 
convenient data sets for further analysis. Section 5 describes 
the elaborations of normal behavior models for the case of a 
healthy gearbox and the two indicators elaborated based on 
the mode ls. Section 6 tests the indicators with data sets from 
a damaged wind turbine. Finally, section 7 presents the more 
relevant conclusions reached.  
2. METHODOLOGY PROPOSED  
This section describes  the method proposed in this paper  for 
monitoring the health condi tion of the gearbox of a wind 
turbine based on its vibration measurements at key points of 
its components where different accelerometers were 
installed . This objective has been studied by several authors 
in different papers of scientific  literature as for example Nie

2 and Wang (2013) or Xie et al. (2015). However, this paper is 
an additional contribution in the field considering different 
perspectives on the use of algorithms from the knowledge 
discovering area. These algorithms will supply indicators  
about the health condition of the wind turbine gearbox. Their 
application will be discussed in both healthy and damaged 
cases of similar wind turbine gearbox es.  
Figure 1 presents a scheme of the method proposed. First, the 
vibration raw data set from the components of a healthy wind 
turbine gearbox w as processed extracting several features . 
This was followed by a principal component analysis able to 
present the most significant features to take into account and 
the conf iguration of a training set. Using t he training data set , 
two algorithms were applied to obtain indicators of the 
gearbox health condition: Self -Organized Map s (SOM) 
(Kohonen, 2001) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)  
(Bishop, 2006 ).  
 
Figure 1. Scheme of the method p roposed.  
 
Once the characterization of the normal healthy  behavior was 
done, the same process was followed with data coming from  
components of a damage d wind turbine gearbox and a 
comparison of results was carried out in order to demonstrate 
the ability of the indicators to monitor  the health conditio n of 
the gearbox. Monitoring these indicators is useful to reduce 
the time of fault discovering, re -schedule the planned 
maintenance planning or to suggest a deeper investigation 
with advanced diagnosis tools.  
3. CHARACTERISTICS OF TH E CASE STUDIED  
The method proposed in the paper was developed using as an 
application a data collection provided by the National 
Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)  (Sheng, 2013) .  This 
data set include s vibrations coming from two 750 kW three -
bladed identi cal wind turbines  composed of a  main low speed 
shaft,  gearbox, high speed shaft and the electrical generator. 
The data set is com ing from dif ferent accelerometers located 
at several points of the gearboxes , whose internal 
configurat ion is divided into four shafts: Planet Carrier 
(PLC ), Low-Speed Shaft  (LS), Intermediate -Speed Shaft  
(IMS) and High -Speed Shaft  (HS) and three stages : low, 
intermediate and high speed  stage. Figure 2 shows the four 
shafts in horizontal alignment and the three stages in vertical 
groups of boxes that correspond to the same stage.  Also Figure 2 shows the location of 8 accelerometers named 
ANX (X : 1 to 8) where vibration data are collected in both 
wind turbines. There are two similar 10 minute tests, one 
coming from the healthy wind turbine  and the other from the 
damaged one . A detailed  description  of all the gearbox 
components (gears, bearings), acceleromet ers, test conditions 
and turbine faults can be found in Sheng  (2013).  According 
to the information about  the physical characteristics of the 
gearbox, the expected characteristic frequencies were 
estimated obtaining:  
 4 values corresponding to the frequencies of each of the 
four shafts (SF, Shaft Frequency))  
 3 values corresponding to the freq uencies of each stage 
in the gearbox (GMF, Gear Mesh Frequency)  
 13x4  values c orresponding to 13 bearings of the 
gearbox and their following 4 characteristic 
frequencies: Outer Race Frequency (BPO), Inner Race 
Frequency (BPI ), Ball Spin Frequency (BS ) and 
Fundamental Train Frequency (FT) . The 13 bearings are 
represented in Figure 2 by triangles.

4. PRE-PROCESSING AND FEATU RE EXTRACTION  
The goal of the first step of the methodology proposed is to 
prepare the data collected from different accelerometers 
located in key points of the wind turbine gearbox in order to 
be useful as inputs for feeding algorithms in charge of 
estimat ing the health condition of th e gearbox. This first step 
of the methodology includes two sequential tasks: pre -
processing of the raw data and extraction of relevant features 
for the diagnosis of the gearbox components. Both will be 
described in the next sub -sections.  
4.1. Pre-processing of the raw vibration data  
The raw data  collected by the 8 accelerometers during the test 
period was filtered and pre -processed in order to reduce the 
background noise of the data collected  and also to obtain a 
set of relevant characteris tics to be thoroughly analyzed in a 

------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------

3 later step. The first task was the elaboration of signal periods  
of equal lengths  on each one of the available signals. After 
that t he use of Time S ynch ronous A veraging  (TSA) was 
initially  studied as a first option  for data analysis . However,  
several issues were encountered  such as the short time length  
of the test , odd gear ratios and a lack of tachometer from some  
tests. Thus, according to MacFadden (2000)  the TSA is 
equivalent to apply ing a Comb type  filter in the frequency 
domain and for t his reason Comb F ilters  were finally used to 
filter out the SF and GMF (Gear Mesh Frequency) harmonics 
from the data set . Additionally, a n envelope analysis was 
carried out oriented to the bearing diagnosis by means of a 
spectral kurtosis filtering. A k urtogram implementation 
(Antoni, 2007  and Wang, 2013 ) was useful to determine 
those frequency bands which were most likely to have BPI, 
BPO and BS impulses  coming from the bearings .  
Figure 3 presents the scheme followed for processing each 
signal coming f rom the accelerometers. As a result of the pre -
processing procedure , three sub-signals were obtained x GMF, 
dGMF (GMF  filtered and residual) and its harmonics, and eBF 
which  is the filtered envelope at an optimum band given by  a 
kurtogram. Figure 3 s hows th e way to obtain a ll of these  sub-
signals.  
Figure 3. Raw signal processing.  
4.2. Feature extraction  
After pre -processing the raw data coming from the 8 
accelerometers mentioned in section 3, several features were 
extracted in order to characterize the informati on collected 
and already filtered relative to the behavior of the gearbox 
components .  Scientific literature suggests a wide variety of 
possible features to be extracted (Qiao, 2015 , Xie, 2015  and 
Wang,  2017) from vibrational data of a wind turbine 
gearbox . In this analysis t hirteen features were  estimated and 
tested in total, seven from  the sub -signal previously obtained 
xGMF  (combined with d GMF) and six from the eBF respectively . 
The list o f these features is  presented in Table 2.  
Features #1, 2, 3 and #8, 9, 10 are time domain statistical 
parameters, while features #5, 6, 7 are condition indicators 
widely used to detect gear mesh defects.  
Features #4,11,12,13 were based on the average FFT,  
windowed by a Hamming function with a 50% overlap.  
Equation 1  describes the procedure followed for the estimation of PR for the signal X. It is able to measure the 
energy spectrum frequency peaks . 
𝑃𝑅 𝑋[𝑓]=∑ 𝑋[𝑓]2∆𝑓1
∑ 𝑅[𝑓]2∆𝑓2,∆𝑓1=0.03𝑓,∆𝑓2=𝛼∆𝑓1             (1) 
 
where 𝑋[𝑓] and 𝑅[𝑓] represent the original signal and the 
residual signal  respectively at frequency 𝑓, after removing all 
frequency magnitudes contained in ∆𝑓1. After several trials 
the parameter 𝛼 was set at 5  and t he spectral res olution was 
adjusted as best possible . Finally ±4Hz was selected  with 
600 signal portions.  
 
5. ESTIMATION OF INDICAT ORS FOR THE WIND TURBINE 
GEARBOX CONDITION  
This section describes two indicators useful to know the 
health condition of a wind turbine gearbox.  They are based 
on a similar approach , but using different algorithms. The 
idea behind the indicators is to present if the current 
vibrational behavior observed corresponds or not to a normal 
condition. In order to do th is the indicators are modelled

4 previ ously with data sets where no anomalies are present. 
After that they can be used for observing new information 
previously not seen. In the next sub -sections the process to 
select the more relevant features is described in order to 
configure the training se ts and after that two different 
algorithms are applied in order to model the indicators. The 
details of thi s process follow.  
5.1. Feature selection  
After the pre -processing and feature extraction described in 
section 4, the information available consists of  eight feature 
datasets, one per sensor, each one composed of 600 
observations and 13 variables  (features extracted) , for each 
case (healthy  and  damaged  wind turbine gearbox ). All d ata 
were normalized by means of z -scores , since they had 
different scales.  
The relevance of the 13 features extracted could be different  
and even null in some cases, and for this reason, a selection 
of the best features explaining the dynamics of the data was 
carried out based on a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
(Bish op 2006).  The eight data sets w ere grouped according to 
the four shafts in the gearbox named PLC, LS, IMS and HS 
as indicated in Figure 2. Table 3 shows in the column named 
sensors  the data sets collected from the  accelerometers in 
Figure 2 that are considered to monitor each shaft. Also each 
data set was divided in two, one containing the variables or 
features 1 to 7 that correspond to the gears monitoring and 8 
to 13 that correspond to the bearings monitoring. The labels 
of these two sets are identified in the column label  in Table 
3. 
Each dataset was filtered in order to eliminate highly 
correlated features and finally a PCA was carried out in order 
to reduce the number of features that are actually  relevant in 
each data set . The reduction obtained is  summarized in Table 
3. The column ID corresponds to the Initial Dimension , the 
column FD corresponds to the Final Dimension  and the 
rightmost column includes the varianc e explained by the 
features fin ally selected in each data set. For example the data 
set D11 had initially 21 variables (7 features x 3 sensors) and 
after the PCA analysis only 9 were necessary , therefore   
explaining more than 80 % of the variance.  
 5.2. SOM -based model  
A self -organizing map (SOM) was trained for each dataset  of 
the healthy gearbox  (Kohonen 2014). A SOM is a type of 
artificial neural network trained using unsupervised learning 
to produce a low -dimensional  discretized representation of 
the input space of the training samples, called a map . The map 
is represented by neurons which weights are patterns 
discovered in the learning process that represent certain areas 
of the input domain. The number of neurons (K) required in 
the maps  was estimate d by running a k-means algorithm 
testing a range from 2 to 100 clusters , obtaining the total sum 
of squared errors with respect to each centroid (SSE)  in each 
trial. The number of neurons finally selected for each map 
was based on the elbow rule  method. The results are listed in 
Table 4.  
 
A  health condition indicator was proposed using the BMU 
(Best Matching Unit) distance computed on each 
observation, divided by the maximum Euclidean distance 
among all nodes , as presented in Equation 2 . 
𝐶𝐼𝑆𝑂𝑀 =𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡 (𝑥,𝑤𝐵𝑀𝑈 )
max ij{𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡 (𝑤𝑖,𝑤𝑗)} (2) 
 
In order to detect anomalies based on the indicator estimated 
in Equation 2 (CI SOM), its distributions were studied in the 
case of a healthy gearbox for each training data set and a 
Kolmogorov -Smirnov test was carried out on the distribution 
of the variabl e log(CI SOM), checking out a normality tendency 
with the signification of α=0.05. Finally, a threshold was 
defined at 95% of fitted distribution, so that each observation 
outside this limit was considered potentially anomalous  or 
corresponding to a symptom  of non -healthy condition .

Figure 4 presents as an example of  the application of this 
procedure to the data set D41 for the healthy gearbox. In this

normal function are presented. Also, the values for deciding

Table 5 summarizes the p-values and thresholds obtained for 
each training set .  
 
 
5.3. GMM -based model  
The SOM model obtained previously reaches the goal of a 
good characterization of the gearbox condition that can be 
used as a reference for the detection of anomalies in the 
gearbox components . However in order to robust this result 
even more , another m odel was developed using the sam e data 
sets but with a different algorithm. In particular, a  Gaussian 
Mixture Model (GMM)  was built for  each dataset 
corresponding to healthy condition of the gearbox (Shalev -
Shwartz, 2014) . A GMM  is a probabilistic model that 
assumes all the samples are generated from a mixture of a 
finite number of Gaussian distributions with unknown 
parameters . The goal of these model s was to measure how 
likely new observations belong or not to  a previously defin ed 
pattern of probability . The GMM models were fitted using  an 
expectation –maximization  (EM) algorithm . In order to 
decide the number of Gaussian distributions to include in 
each GMM model , three criteria w ere tested . They were the 
BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) , the AIC (Akaike 
Information Criterion ) and the K-fold cross validation 
criterions with a 12.5% data fraction  to avoid overfitting.  A 
GMM model was created for each data set testing from 1 to 
20 Gaussian components for the three criteria before 
mentioned.  
 
Figure 5. GMM test performance using 1 and 20 Gaussian 
components using the dataset D2 1. 
 
Figure 5 shows an example for the case of the data set D21 . 
Finally the BIC criterion was selected because it penalizes 
more the excess of parameters. Once this selection was done, 
a final version of the GMM models was obtained using 10% 
of data fraction . They were  validated by computing the ratio of observations included wi thin 95% of the density region 
(R95%).Table 6 shows the parameters of the GMM models for 
each data set.  
 
According to the models developed a new health indicator 
CIGMM was estimated based on the density function obtaine d 
p(x), according to Equation 3 . Th is indicator takes into 
account that distant data points from the optimum behavior 
will have low values of p(x), so CI GMM will increase

𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑥{𝑝(𝑥)}) (3) 
 
6. USE OF THE HEALTH CONDITION INDICATORS FOR 
DETECTION OF ANOMALI ES 
The health condition indicators pro posed CISOM and CI GMM 
were estimated for the datasets of the damaged wind turbine 
gearbox using the SOM and GMM models  obtained from the 
datasets of the healthy wind turbine gearbox.  Thus, for each 
shaft, the condition  of gears and bearings was evaluated 
throughout the entire 10 -minute test.  
Figur e 6 shows their temporal evolution corresponding to the 
PLC and HS  shafts  used as examples. The sub -figures a and 
c correspond to the gears and the sub -figures b and d to the 
bearings in the shafts PLC and HS respectively. The first 
result  from this figure is that both indicators have similar 
behavior s and both are able to dete ct abnormal behavior. 
Also, it can be observed in Figure 6 that the cases a, c and d 
present   abnormal behavior detected by the indicators in the 
data sets of the damaged gearbox because they are 
overpassing the corresponding thresholds of normal behavior 
expected (disc ontinue lines). However, in case b the 
indicators are closer to the thresholds of normal behavior and 
it is more difficult to decide if an anomaly is present. In order 
to confirm the results shown in Figure 6, a different graphical 
representa tion was used facing the indicators corresponding 
to the gears (horizontal axis) against the indicators 
corresponding to the bearings (vertical axis) for the four 
shafts. Only the results for the indicator CI GMM  are presented  
in Figure 7  where in discontin ued lines the respective 
thresholds of normal behavior  are indicated , in red dots the 
data corresponding to the damaged gearbox and in green dots 
those belonging to the healthy gearbox.  
From Figure 7 it is possible to conclude the presence of 
constant and major faults on gears in the PLC and HS shafts, 
and also faults in the bearing of the IMS and HS shafts. Th ese

 7 7. CONCLUSION  
This paper has presented a methodology to estimate two 
indicators able to detect anomalies in a wind turbine gearb ox 
based on vibrations collected from key points of its 
components. The methodology described covers several 
steps from the pre -processing of the raw vibrational data until 
the estimation of normal behavior models and the indicators 
based on them able to d etect anomalies. The two estimated 
indicators have a similar objective but based on different 
algorithms, SOM and GMM respectively. The use of them in 
parallel makes the detection of abnormal behavior  more 
robust . 
The models and indicators developed used t wo different data 
sets of vibrations collected by accelerometers in two similar 
gearboxes of a wind turbine, one of then healthy and another 
one damaged.  
The models and indicators obtained demonstrated their 
ability to detect anomalies in the data sets cor responding to 
the damaged gearbox suggesting their possible use in the 
future.  However, the proposed m ethod exhibits some 
limitations such as the best that the available datasets 
corresponded to a simple point of operation of the gearboxes 
(1200 rpm in the  High Speed shaft) and the collection of data 
was for a short time period. Also, the combined effect of 
several failure modes in the damaged data set has to be taken 
into account. Future studies  will try to overpass these 
limitations.  In any case, the usef ulness of the proposed 
method has been proven  by different tests  as was described 
in the paper.
