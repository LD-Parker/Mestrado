ABSTRACT  
Predictive maintenance and condition monitoring systems for 
wind turbines have seen increas ed adoption to minimize 
downtime , reduc ing operation and maintenance costs. On 
today’s wind power plants, the integrated supervisory control 
and data acquisition (SCADA) system provides low -
frequency operational data that can be leveraged to quantify 
a wind turbine’ s health. The aim of this study is to utilize 
machine -learning techniques to predict axial cracking  
failures in  wind turbine gearbox  bearings up to 1 month ahead 
of time . The failures are assumed to have occurred when the 
investigated bearing was replaced.  While current SCADA 
systems show the overall condition of a wind turbine, often 
they do not allow  for the investigation of specific gearbox 
bearings ’ health . To enrich bearing fault signatures, 
additional data are computed  through  physics -based models  
using  gearbox  design information . Based on SCADA data, 
modeled data , and bearing failure log data from an actual 
wind plant,  the performances of different machine -learning 
models on unseen data are then evaluated using industry -
standard metrics , such as precision, recall , F1 score, and area 
under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ). Results 
show the overall system performance enhancement in 
predicting bearing failure when modeled data are included 
with SCADA data.  The reduction in terms of false alarms is 
about 50%, and improvement in terms of precision , F1 score , 
and AUC  is about 33% , 12%, and 6%, respectively, based on 
the best performing modeling case in this study.   1. INTRODUCTION  
Wind e nergy has been advancing rapidly as it plays a very 
significant part in clean -energy -based electric power 
generation (Kusiak  & Li, 201 1). However, the operation and 
maintenance (O&M) cost of a wind farm accounts for up to 
30% of total energy cost  (Fischer , Besnard,  & Bertling , 
2012 ), which can be reduced th rough continuous monitoring 
and successfully detecting incipient wind turbine failures. For 
this reason, predictive maintenance and condition monitoring 
systems are being implemented for O&M decision -maki ng in 
the wind industry  (Lau, Ma, & Pecht , 2012 ; Fen g, Qiu, 
Crabtree, Long, & Tavner, 2013; Qiao , & Lu, 2015 ). These 
systems utilize a combination of statistics, data mining , and 
machine -learning -based techniques for fault diagnostics and 
prognostics, to assess  wind turbine performance 
abnormali ties and pre dict time to failure. The performance of 
these systems is improving with advance s in data acquisition 
and signal processing technologies  (Qiao , Zhang,  & Chow , 
2015; Zaher, McArthur, Infield, & Patel , 2009; 
Colone,  Reder,  Tautz -Weinert, Melero, Natarajan,  & 
Watson, 2017 ).            
Wind turbines operate in adverse weather conditions and 
their drivetrains undergo severe variable loading because of 
emergency shutdowns, varying wind speed , and fluctuations  
in energy demand (Yang , Tavner , Crabtree , Feng, & Qiu, 
2013 ). One of the most important part s of a geared wind 
turbine drivetrain system is a gearbox that comprises  various 
bearings, gears , and shafts. Most of the gearbox failures are 
related to the shaft bearings and result in very costly repairs 
and high do wntime (Saidi , Ben Ali , Bechhoefer , & 
Benbouzid , 2017 ). Research has shown that cracks  can 
develop in the gear box bearing s only within 3 years of a wind 
turbine’s operation (Stadler  & Stubenrauch , 2013 ). The failed 
bearings can damage surrounding component s of the

2 gearbox , resulting in costly replacement of various 
components (Musial , Butterfield , & McNiff , 2007 ; Yang , 
Tavner , Crabtree , & Wilkinson , 2010 ). For these reasons, 
predicting wind turbine gearbox bearing failure is crucial.   
A wide range of appro aches for condition monitoring and 
fault prediction have been developed  (Leite, Araújo, & 
Rosas, 2018 ). Kusiak and Verma ( 2012 ) analyzed the bearing 
faults considering over temperature events  and using neural 
networks . Zhang (2018) put forward an automatic  fault 
prediction method to predict main bearing fault using neural 
networks. The author  predict s the bearing temperature using 
other features , such as active power output, ambient 
temperature, and turbine speed, and the fault is identified 
based on the pr ediction error. Koukoura  et al. ( 2018 ) 
developed an approach to predict wind turbine planet beari ng 
fault before 12 months, 6 months, and 1 month  using a linear 
regression model . These approaches generally use historical 
data of wind turbines collected by  a supervisory control and 
data acquisition ( SCADA ) system to identify patterns that 
lead to failu re. The SCADA system typically record s 
averages of sensor channels over  10-minute intervals to 
reduce storage and bandwidth. The data include various 
measureme nts, such as rotor speed, power, bearing 
temperature, and lubricant temperature  (Zaher, McArthur,  
Infield, & Patel, 2009 ). These SCADA data show the overall 
condition of a wind turbine and can be leveraged to detect 
when the turbine’s performance is degrad ing and to identify 
if a fault is developing. However, it becomes challenging to 
predict the fail ure of a specific wind turbine  gearbox bearing, 
because the SCADA data are often not directly linked to any 
gearbox  component. To bridge the gap, different fea tures are 
calculated from SCADA data using physics -based models 
and the gearbox design. These mod eled data , along with the 
SCADA data , are utilized for the bearing failure prediction , 
with an aim to improv e the performance of current 
prognostics techniques . 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 
describes characteristics of data,  the method to compute 
bearing -specific modeling data , and the data preprocessing 
technique we use. Section 3 presents strategies to address  the 
class imbalance pr oblem and machine -learning algorithms 
used for this study. In  Section 4 , we compare  the 
performances  of machine -learning models on historical 
bearing failure data  using standard evaluation metrics . 
Finally, Section 5 summarizes our contribution to the fiel d of 
wind turbine prognostics and discusses the areas of future 
work.         
2. DATA DESCRIPTION  AND PREPROCESSING  
The data used in th is study have been collected by a project 
partner from 12/01/2008 to 10/31/2018 at a wind farm  located 
in Texas . The investi gated data set contains a total of 13 1.5-
MW wind turbines that have an  identical  gearbox 
configuration. Each shaft of the gearbox has two bearings (A and B) mounted on different axial locations , and a ll 13 
turbines had encountered either high-speed shaft (HSS) or 
intermediate -speed shaft (IMS)  axial cracking failure on  
bearing A or bearing B. The bearings were replaced,  and 
lubricants of some turbines were also upgraded after the 
failure. Because  the effect of installing new bearings on old 
components is b eyond the scope of this study, we considered 
data up until the first failure of any bearing of the gearbox . 
The beari ng replacement dates are assumed as their failure 
dates in this study, but they could be different from when the 
actual failures occurred  or become detectable through 
instrumentation.  
The clear separation of train and test data in the beginning is 
importa nt as it helps  avoid accidently sharing information of 
test data during model development based on train data. To 
assess  the model  performa nce across a wind turbine’s life, we 
randomly select ed 10 turbines for model training and use d the 
remaining three  turbines for testing. It is worth noting that the 
three  turbines used for test ing had different bearing failures, 
but we will be treating the m as the same in our study . The 
rationale is that they share common  SCADA data channels 
that could be indicative of b earing failures and the modeled 
data related to them is normalized. Figure 1 shows the 
timeline of different bearing failures of all the turbines  and 
whether the data are used for model training or testing 
purposes.

The investigated SCADA data consist of 10 -minute -interval

3 recorded per day by a single turbine in the SCADA system.  
The gearbox bearing temperature is measured at another 
bearing (bearing C) on a high-speed shaft , which is different 
from the invest igated bearings A and B and used to support 
the axial loads. The “status code” channel i n the SCADA data 
shows the state of a wind turbine at a given time. During low 
wind speed, shutdowns, and maintenance activities, no power 
is produced by the wind turbi ne. Because these samples are 
out of the scope of our analysis, we filter them out and o nly 
consider the data when a turbine was in the running condition.  
To represent the health condition of a bearing, additional data 
are calculated from the filtered SCAD A data using physics -
based models (Guo & Keller , 2020 ; Guo, Sheng, Phillips, 
Keller, Vee rs, & Williams , 2020 ). The various parameters for 
HSS bearings and IMS bearings in modeled data are shown 
in Table 2. An analytical roller sliding model (Guo & Keller , 
2020) was used to calculate bearing roller and cage kinematic 
and sliding speed, which i s important input for computing  
frictional energy generation s on roller/raceway contact 
surfaces , as detailed in  Guo et al. , 2020 .  Bearing loads w ere 
calculated using a simple lumped -parameter model of high -
speed and intermediate -speed shafts ( Guo et al. , 2020 ). Roller  
load distribution and deflections are estimated analytically 
using the approach in Harris & Kotzalas (2007 ). All these 
physics -based models require infor mation on gearbox design 
and turbine operation his tory (SCADA data) as the input.

All time  series data in Tables 1 and 2  (i.e., SCADA data and 
modeled data ), are cand idate features for this study.  The 
Pearson co rrelation coefficient is calculated to determine 
linear correlation between  each pair of features  and to avoid 
multicollinearity . The features such as ambient temperature, 
bearing roller load, roller deflection, rolling speed , and 
sliding speed are dropped  considering the collinearity 
threshold as 0.9. The selection of which colinear feature to 
drop is done by using domain knowledge . For example, 
nacelle temperature is kept as it is more related to the wind 
turbine than highly correlating ambient temperatur e. As a 
result of  the high frequency of data collection, it is possible for SCADA data to contain noise  and sensor errors . The 
outliers in the training data are detected using a 1.5-
interquartile -range (IQR)  method  (Tukey , 1997 ), as it is 
considered robust  against skewed d ata. Because  the median 
value s are  not sensitive to outliers and  show the central 
tendency in asymmetrical distribution s, we replace detected 
outliers with median values . One thing to note is that t he 
detected outliers are few and they occ ur randomly. Also, we 
do not see higher frequency of outliers when a turbine is 
about to fail.  
Since  we only filter  the data when a turbine was producing 
power , we do not have a continuous stream of 10 -minute 
frequency  data and the total number of rows of data in any 
day can be between 0 and 144. With an assumption that the 
data do not change significantly in a single day, we aggregate 
the data generated on the  same day and represent them with 
summary statistics , as shown in Table 3. Because  the 
prediction horizon (1 month)  is comparatively long , 
aggregated data help us understand meaningful trends and 
changes that will signify an impending failure.  We use daily 
summary statistics of each feature  for model training and 
testing.

same turbine’s  processed data  (i.e., summary statistics)  
would look like for a same period .  
The power a wind turbine produces at a given wind spe ed can 
be important to quantify its health. Figure 4 shows a typical 
power curve of a win d turbine ( Sohoni, Gupta, & Nema, 
2016) .

Figure 4. Wind turbi ne power curve.  
A turbine operates at the rated power in Region 3 , which is 
considered to be the best for its operation ( Sohoni, Gupta, & 
Nema, 2016 ). In Region 3, load on the bearing is high and the 
bearing sliding is low, which results in less frictional  energy. 
When a turbine is operating in Region 1  and early phase o f 
Region 2 , the bearing sliding is higher , thereby  causing 
higher frictional energy (Guo & Keller, 20 20). It has been 
proven that frictional energy causes white etching cracks  in 
bench tests  of bearing  steel specimens  (Gould & Greco, 
2015). Hence, we calcu late how many data points lie in each 
approximate region in a day using the wind speed limits given 
in Table 4. The regions are approximate because the upper wind speed limit (i.e. , 6 m/s) f or Region 1’ is higher than a 
typical turbine’s cut -in wind speed (e.g., 3 to 4 m/s), and the 
upper wind speed limit (i.e. , 10 m/s) for Region 2’ is lower 
than a typical turbine’s rated wind speed (e.g. , 12 to 15 m/s).  
They are defined based on whether the  bearing is more prone 
to sliding and generate s more frictional en ergy.

Region 1 ’ 0 m/s  6 m/s  
Region 2 ’ 6 m/s  10 m/s  
Region 3 ’ 10 m/s  25 m /s 
Our aim is to predict bearing failure at least 1 month ahead of 
the actual failure (i.e., replacement date ); therefore , the last 1 
month of any wind turbine’s data is labeled as “faulty ” and 
earlier data are labeled as “healthy ,” as shown in Figure 5. 
The r ationale behind such labeling is an assumption that the 
data from the  last month before the failure contains a strong 
signal of bearing fault.

3. METHODOLOGY  
A supervised learning algorithm  analyze s the training data 
and ident ifies a linear or nonlinear boundary separating 
healthy and faulty class es of the training data , which can then 
be used to predict a class of new instances. Therefore, w e 
used supervised learning algorithms in this study.  Becaus e 
we mark only the last 1 mo nth of  data as “faulty ,” we have an 
extreme ly disproportionate ratio (~ 90:1) of observations in 
each class  of the training data.  Because of the class 
imbalance , algorithm s become biased in favor of data with 
the majority class and ignore data with the min ority class. 
Therefore, we utilize the following two techniques  to address 
class imbalance and evaluate the performance of each in 
different models . We do not use undersampling techniques , 
as they lose a lot of information  about the healthy turbine 
data.   
• Synthetic Minority Over -Sampling Technique  
(SMOTE ): SMOTE  (Chawla,  Bowyer,  Hall,  & 
Kegelmeyer , 2002 ) is an oversampling  technique in 
which new examples from the minority class  are 
synthetically generat ed. It selects two minority class 
instances randomly that are close in feature space and 
synthesizes a new sample at any point between the line 
joining them. This technique  is better than random 
oversampling , which  create s duplicate instances of a 
minority  class that do not add any new information.  
• Cost -Sensit ive Learning: In cost-sensitive learning 
(Zadrozny, Langford, & Abe, 2003 ), we penalize the 
learning algorithm by increasing the cost of the 
classification mistake on the minority class. Because  we 
have a class imbalance of  about  90:1, we penalize the 
algorithm 90 times more if it wrongly classifies the 
faulty  data as healthy.  
To build bearing failure prediction models, we selected f our 
algori thms : logistic regression  (McCullagh & Nelder,  1989) , 
random forest  (Liaw & Wiener, 2002) , extreme gradient 
boostin g (XGBoost ) (Chen & Carlos, 2016) , and long short -
term memory ( LSTM ) networks  (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 
1997) , which have the lowest to high est complexity , 
respectively .      
Logistic regression  is a linear classifier that finds a 
hyperplane in a feature space to separate observations 
according to their classes. The logistic regression transforms 
the output of a linear function using a logistic sigmoid 
function , such that it results in the probability value that can 
be mapp ed to a specific class. We utiliz e a logistic regression algorithm to find a linear boundary between healthy and 
faulty  wind turbine data.  
Random forest  is an ensemble learning method that 
combines the outputs of a large number of decision trees and 
finds  a nonlinear boundary in the feat ure space to separate 
classes. A decision tree is considered as a weak learner and 
often results in overfitting. In a random forest  algorithm,  
decision trees are grown using only a random subset of 
features that reduces cor relation among them. The final 
prediction of the observation is based on the voting of all 
decision trees , which outperforms any single decision tree 
and accounts for errors made by some.  
XGBoost  is a decision -tree-based ensemble algorithm. It 
uses a gradient-boosting framework in which decision trees 
are grown sequentially by accounting for errors made by prior 
ones. XGBoost also finds the nonlinear boundary in a feature 
space among classes. Further, it  is better than other boosting 
algorithm s, as it is o ptimized via parallel processing,  tree-
pruning , and regularization to avoid bias and overfitting.  
LSTM  is an artificial , recurrent , neural network architecture 
that is used to learn order dependence of sequential data. One 
LSTM unit contains input, output , and forget gates , which are 
used by a model to remember previous values. LSTM is 
considered to be the state -of-the-art algorithm for time series 
classification , as it efficiently accounts for the lagged values  
and is able to capture any underlying pattern in the sequential 
data. We util ize an LSTM network to predict wind turbine 
bearing failure at any given time using the past 1 month of 
sequential data.  
SMOTE and most of the existing sampling techniques cannot 
consider the temporal structure of  multivariate  sequential 
data. Because  LSTM handle s imbalanced data and  learn s to 
classify accurately  with correct cost function, we use only 
cost-sensitive learning  to train LSTM model s.  
The gearbox bearing failure does not  happen instantaneously 
and recent historical data are also very helpful for 
prognostics. Logistic regression, random forest , and 
XGBoost evaluate data points at a given time without 
bringing forward information from the past. Therefore, we 
add lagging var iables of SCADA channels up to  30 days 
while training these models. These  lag values are used to 
capture any underlying pattern in the last 1 month  before the 
bearing failure.  LSTM models inherently handle a sequence 
of past observations as an input ; there fore, we do not add lag 
variables while training them .  
All four algorith ms are trained and tested using the following 
two sets of data.  The list of final features is also shown.

speed, rotor speed, bearing temperature, oil temperature,  
and nacelle temperature; daily number of data points

data points lying in power curve Region 1 ’, Region 2 ’, 
and Region 3 ’. 
To compare the performanc es of algorithms  it is important to 
choose  the right evaluation metric. For a typical  binary  
classification model, a confusion matrix is normally used to 
evaluate its performance  (shown in Figure 6).   
 
Figure 6. Confusion matrix.  
The confusion matrix terms are defined as follows : 
• True Negatives : Correct predictions of “Healthy ” class 
samples 
• False Negatives : “Fault y” class samples incorrectly 
predicted as “Healthy ” (i.e., “missed  alarms ”)  
• True Positives : Correct predictions of “Faulty ” class 
samples  
• False Positives : “Healthy ” class samples incorrectly 
predicted as “Faulty ” (i.e., “false alarms ”). 
Because  we have a class imbalance, standard metrics such as 
accuracy  and error rate are biased toward the data with the 
majority class. We rely on precision, recall , F1 score , and 
area under receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUC ) to 
evaluate all models in this study.  
We can calculate precision, recall , and F1  score using  the 
formulas shown in Table 5. We consider the turbine’s last 1 
month of data as positives and earlier data as negatives.  
Precision is used to minimize false alar ms, whereas recall is 
used to minimize missed alarms. As the bearing’s failure cost 
is high, we would prefer high  recall with very few missed 
alarms. However, there is a trade -off between precision and 
recall, and an increase in recall comes at a cost of a  decrease 
in precision. If there is less precision in a prediction model, 
we get many false alarms. Because gearb ox bearings are not 
easily accessible, inspecting false alarms costs a lot as well. 
Therefore, we also use the F1 score to evaluate the overall  
performance of a prediction model , as it is a harmonic mean 
of precision and recall.  AUC is the area under rece iver operating characteristic -ROC 
(Fawcett , 2004) curve. A ROC curve is a probabilistic curve 
that illustrates the trade -off between  true positive rate (TPR) 
and false positive rate (FPR) at various classification 
thresholds.  TPR and FPR can be calculated using formulas  
given in Table 5.  The AUC provides a summary of the 
model’s performance using a single number  and i t shows the 
model’s ability t o distinguish between positive and negative 
classes. The AUC can be  between 0 .5 and 1, and the higher 
the AUC , the better the model. When the AUC is 0.5 , the 
model does not have class separation capacity. Since AUC is 
threshold -independent , it quantifies  the model’s performance 
holistically  and we can utilize it to compare different models.

We adopt the best or recommended practices in the model 
development processes. To build logistic regression and 
random forest models , we use the Scikit -Learn library  
(INRIA , 2018), and use the XGBoost  library (DMLC, 2019) 
for XGBoost models. Lo gistic regression, random forest , and 
XGBoost use a number of hyperparameters. We performed a  
randomized grid search to select the optimum 
hyperparameters that yield the best results using F1  score as 
a scoring m etric. To build LSTM models, we used the keras 
library  (Chollet  et al.,  2015 ), which is a deep learning 
framework. The LSTM models have two hidden layers , with 
50 and 25 nodes in each , respectively. To determine a number 
of hidden nodes in each layer, we u sed a  trial-and-error 
method. Because  LSTM m odels are prone to overfit, we 
added two layers of dropout , with a 50% dropout rate to avoid 
overfitting.  Based on the highest accuracy on validation data, 
we selected a  final architecture .  
4. RESULTS  
Table 6 and T able 7 summarize the performances  of models  
built using SMOTE and cost-sensitive learning as a class -
balancing technique , respectively . We compare these two 
methods to address class imbalance in the data. The best 
method to remedy class  imbalance  is highly dependent on the 
data set ( Weiss, McCarthy,  and Zabar,  2007 ) and in this 
problem, cost-sensitive learning performs slightly  better than 
oversampling usi ng SMOTE for most of the algorithm and 
data combinations.  As observed  in Table 7 , logistic 
regression models have the  highest recall  of 0.86 (SCADA  
data) a nd 0.85 ( both SCADA and modeled data) with cost -
sensitive learning , whereas LSTM networks have the  highest 
precision of 0.52 , F1 score  of 0.57 , and AUC of 0.9 7 using 
both SCADA and modeled data. Because the  F1 score is a

7 harmonic mean of precision and recall, it is reduced 
significantly by poor precision in all models bu ilt using 
logistic regression, random forest , and XGBoost algorithms.   
By adding 1 to 30 days of lag values while training logistic 
regression, random forest , and XGBoost models, fea ture 
space increases significantly , which result s in overfi tting 
observed by higher  performance on training data and lower  
performance on test data . The reason for poor performance of 
logistic regression models might be that the data are not 
linearly separ able. For tree -based models such as random forest and XGBoost, it has been observed that their 
performance is compromised in high -dimensional data  
(Jiang,  Cui, Zhang , & Fu, 2018 ; Nguyen , Huang , & Nguyen , 
2015 ). LSTM models are preferred for prognostics pro blems , 
as they can store the information about the recent historical 
data well and exploit the time dependency between them. 
Although LSTM models perform better, they do not offer 
model interpre tability and feature importance. LSTM models 
also require a la rge amount of data and they are more 
computationally expensive.

Our aim is to improve current gearbox bearing axial failure 
prognostic methods by addin g modeled data that capture a 
bearing’s fault signature to existing SCADA data. The results 
show that, for all four algorithms investigated with cost -
sensitive learning,  when modeled data are added, precision is 
improved, which increases the F1 score. The modeled data 
help reduce the number of false alarms by sacrificing 
relatively less recall. The overall system performance is also 
improved by an increase in AUC score.   We can visualize the performances of all models on unseen 
test data using the confusion  matrix and ROC curves. Figure 
7 and Figure 8 show the performance of LSTM models built 
using only SCADA data and modeled data along with 
SCADA data, respectively. When modeled data are used, we 
can see that performance is improved , as evidenced by the 
number of false alarms reduced from 105 to 52, about 50% 
improvement. By referring to the metrics in Table 7, the 
improvement in terms of precision is about 33%, and the 
sacrifice in terms of recall is about 17%, leading to an 
improvement in F1 score by 12% a nd in AUC by about 6%.  Model  Algorithm  Data  Model Performance

5. CONCLUSION  
This study shows the potential of bearing -specific data 
computed using physics -based  models and gearbox design to 
improve the existing bearing failure prognostics techniques  
that use only SCADA data . The modeled data help to reduce 
false alarms significantly  and improve F1 score  and overall 
AUC , about 50% , 12%, and 6% , respectively , in th e best 
performing  modeling case of this study . As there is a trade -
off between precision and recall, the optimum model should 
be chosen by tuning the classification threshold on the ROC 
curve and considering the cost associated with missed and 
false alarms . In this study, we build a generalized model that 
can predict failure  of any high-speed or intermediate -speed 
shaft  bearing caused by  axial cracking . However, overall performance can be improved if we make individual model s 
for each bearing using SCADA an d modeled data. We do not 
know when the bearing cracks start developing until they are 
visuall y detectable  or through dedicated condition 
monitoring solutions. In this study , we try to detect signals in 
the last 1 month before a failure  is assumed to have  occurred 
when the bearing is replaced . Therefore, another area to 
further study  this work woul d be to find the optimal time 
window to predict failure onsets  of bearings  that are  deemed  
physically detectable  and cost effective to support optimized 
maintenan ce decision -making .
