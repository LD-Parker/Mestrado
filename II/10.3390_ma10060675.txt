Abstract: Varying speed conditions bring a huge challenge to incipient fault detection of rolling
element bearings because both the change of speed and faults could lead to the amplitude Ô¨Çuctuation
of vibration signals. Effective detection methods need to be developed to eliminate the inÔ¨Çuence
of speed variation. This paper proposes an incipient fault detection method for bearings under
varying speed conditions. Firstly, relative residual (RR) features are extracted, which are insensitive
to the varying speed conditions and are able to reÔ¨Çect the degradation trend of bearings. Then,
a health indicator named selected negative log-likelihood probability (SNLLP) is constructed to fuse
a feature set including RR features and non-dimensional features. Finally, based on the constructed
SNLLP health indicator, a novel alarm trigger mechanism is designed to detect the incipient fault.
The proposed method is demonstrated using vibration signals from bearing tests and industrial wind
turbines. The results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for incipient fault detection of
rolling element bearings under varying speed conditions.

1. Introduction
Rolling element bearings play a vital role in various industrial Ô¨Åelds such as aviation, energy,
and metallurgy. They generally work under varying speed conditions, which brings great challenges
to the health monitoring and performance degradation evaluation of bearings [ 1]. For instance, the
rotating speed of wind turbines changes because of time-varying wind speed and grid control over the
long term. In such operation conditions, vibration signals always show non-stationary characteristics.
Both amplitudes and frequency components of vibration signals change with time [ 2,3]. Traditional
health monitoring methods generally assume that the change of vibration signals is just caused by
faults of mechanical equipment [ 4]. Therefore, these methods are unsuitable to health monitoring in the
varying speed conditions. Aiming for the issue of incipient fault detection of rolling element bearings
under varying speed conditions, new health monitoring methods should be developed. Basically,
there are two crucial factors determining the accuracy of incipient fault detection under varying speed
conditions: health indicator extraction and alarm trigger mechanism.
In the incipient fault detection process, a health indicator is always desired to effectively
compress the large amount of vibration signals and reÔ¨Çect the degradation trend of rotating machinery.
Many studies have been conducted on constructing such health indicators. Niu et al. [ 5] exploited
self-organizing map neural networks to extract a minimum quantization error fusion indicator for
methane compressor health monitoring. Soualhi et al. [ 6] used the Hilbert‚ÄìHuang transform to extract
Hilbert spectral density as a health indicator to track the degradation of the critical components of
bearings. Li et al. [ 7] extracted a compressed acoustic emission indicator based on the empirical model

decomposition for gear fault detection. Guo et al. [ 8] proposed a recurrent neural network based health
indicator for remaining useful life prediction of bearings. Javed et al. [ 9] extracted a novel indicator
based on trigonometric functions and cumulative transformation to monitor the degradation trend
of cutting tools and bearings. Qian et al. [ 10] applied recurrence quantiÔ¨Åcation analysis to extract
recurrence plot entropy indicators for monitoring bearing performance degradation. Picot et al. [ 11]
proposed a statistic-based spectral health indicator to detect bearing faults. These indicators are able
to reÔ¨Çect the degradation trend of rotating machinery, but they are hard to avoid being inÔ¨Çuenced
by the operation condition change. On the contrary, indicators such as kurtosis are insensitive to the
change of speed condition, but they are unable to reÔ¨Çect the degradation trend of rotating machinery.
Generally speaking, a desirable monitoring indicator should predominantly satisfy the following
two requirements: (1) being insensitive to the change of operation conditions; and (2) reÔ¨Çecting
the degradation degree of fault severity quantitatively. Considering the shortcoming of existing
indicators, it is necessary to extract new health indicators for the incipient fault detection under
varying speed conditions.
After constructing health indicators, an alarm trigger mechanism is needed to judge whether
incipient faults occur on rotating machinery or not. Various fault trigger mechanisms have been
designed to deal with this problem. Ginart et al. [ 12] presented a fault trigger mechanism based
on constant alarm threshold for fault detection of rotating machinery. Li et al. [ 7] detected gearbox
faults using a probability trigger mechanism, i.e., if more than a given percentage of features are
greater than a Ô¨Åxed fault detection threshold, then it is believed that the incipient fault happens.
Loutas et al. [13] employed an alarm trigger mechanism based on a heuristic threshold for health
monitoring of gearboxes. Li et al. [14] proposed an adaptive continuous trigger mechanism, which is
regarded that the incipient fault has occurred when several continuous indicator values exceed the 3 
interval. Jin et al. [ 15] employed a combined alarm trigger mechanism to successfully detect faults
of cooling fans and motor bearings. These approaches have good performance in the fault detection.
However, they still have several shortcomings. For instance, in the probability trigger mechanism, the
percentage is calculated based on all of the historical measurements, which changes little when a new
indicator value above the threshold appears. In the continuous trigger mechanism, several continuous
indicator values above the threshold often occur in the signiÔ¨Åcant faults stage, but seldom happen in
the incipient fault stage.
To deal with the aforementioned problems, this paper proposes an incipient fault detection
method for rolling element bearings under varying speed conditions. The major contributions of this
method are: (1) relative residual (RR) features based on extreme learning machine (ELM) are proposed,
which are insensitive to the varying speed conditions and are able to better reÔ¨Çect the degradation
trend of bearings; (2) a health indicator, i.e., selected negative log-likelihood probability (SNLLP), is
constructed to fuse multiple features; and (3) an alarm trigger mechanism is established to improve
the accuracy of incipient fault detection based on the analysis of the fault typical behavior.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the basic theory of ELM and
Gaussian mixture model (GMM), respectively. In Section 3, the proposed incipient fault detection
method is introduced in detail. In Section 4, the health state of the industrial wind turbine is monitored
to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Some concluding remarks are drawn in
Section 5.
2. Brief Introduction to ELM and GMM
2.1. Extreme Learning Machine
ELM was proposed by Huang for single hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) [ 16].
The learning speed of the feedforward neural network is constrained by gradient-based iterative
learning algorithms. Unlike many other popular learning algorithms, the learning speed of ELM is fast
because input weights and hidden neuron biases are randomly generated [ 17]. ELM has been widely

and good generalization performance.
The output of SLFNs with Lhidden nodes can be expressed as:
fL(x)=L

where aiis the weight vector connecting input nodes and the ith hidden node, biis the bias of the ith
hidden node, biis the weight connecting the ith hidden node to the output node and G(ai,bi,x)is the
output of the ith hidden node with respect to the input x. The architecture of SLFNs is shown in the

where ‹Ω‡Øú is the weight vector connecting input nodes and the ith hidden node, ‹æ‡Øú is the bias of the 
ith hidden node, ﬂö‡Øú is the weight connecting the ith hidden node to the output node and ‹Ω(‹©‡Øú,‹æ‡Øú,)›î 
is the output of the ith hidden node with respect to the input x. The architecture of SLFNs is shown 
in the Figure 1.

The number of hidden nodes ‹Æ is always less than the number of training samples, which 
means that the training error cannot be exactly ze ro but can approach zero . ELM randomly generates

2.2. Gaussian Mixture Model
GMM has strong robustness and excellent computing performance to model the complicated
internal distribution characteristic contained in the data by using several Gaussian mixture
components [ 18]. This characteristic makes it very suitable to smooth the probability distribution
of arbitrary shape. Therefore, the GMM has been widely used in image background extraction and
speech recognition in recent years [19].
Theoretically, arbitrary data can be expressed by MGaussian probability density functions

with the aid of the expectation‚Äìmaximization (EM)

Step 1: The K-means clustering algorithm is Ô¨Årst utilized to initialize GMM parameters xj0,uj0,√•j0.
Step 2: To each training data xi, estimate the probability produced by each unimodal Gaussian
probability density function. The probability produced by the jth Gaussian mixture component is
expressed as

Once the Ô¨Ånal parameters are determined, the GMM that is trained by the sample set has been
constructed. Then, the trained GMM can be used to evaluate the membership degree of new data
relative to the training sample set, which is able to be denoted by the p(xijF).
3. Proposed Incipient Fault Detection Method
The Ô¨Çowchart of the proposed method is shown in Figure 2. It is composed of three modules, i.e.,
RR extraction, health indicator construction and incipient fault detection.
In the RR features extraction module, real-time vibration signals acquired from rotating machinery
are de-noised by singular value decomposition (SVD) to enhance weak incipient fault characteristics.
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Materials 2017 ,10, 675 5 of 15
Then, dimensional features are extracted from the de-noised signals. Since the dimensional features
are easily inÔ¨Çuenced by speed variation, RR features are proposed to reduce the interference and better
reÔ¨Çect the health degradation trend of bearings. In the health indicator construction module, a feature
set is made up of RR features and non-dimensional features. Then, some features are selected from
the feature set using degradation evaluation metrics, and the dimension of these selected features
is further reduced by orthogonal locality preserving projections (OLPP). A novel health indicator
called SNLLP is constructed based on GMM to comprehensively quantify performance degradation of
bearings. In the incipient fault detection module, based on the SNLLP indicator, the incipient fault
is detected by the proposed alarm trigger mechanism. More details about these three modules are
presented as follows.

3.1. RR Featur es Extraction 
In the RR features extraction module, at first, real-time vibration signals are acquired from 
sensors attached on rolling element bearings. Since bearing fault characteristics, especially in the 
incipient stage, are always submerged in strong ba ckground noise, SVD is employed to cancel the 
noise imbedded in vibration signals [20]. Then, original features are extracted from the de-noised signals in time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency domain. Generally, these features are classified into two classes, i.e., dimensional features and non-dimensional features. Many dimensional features are always able to directly reflect the health degradation trend of bearings at a constant speed condition, but the amplitudes of th ese features are also susc eptible to varying speed 
conditions. To explore the relationships between the speed and dimensional features, varying speed 
experiments of bearings are executed in a test rig.  
The experimental system is shown in Figure 3. The test rig includes two bearings, a 3-hp motor 
for driving bearing operation. The motor rotating speed is controlled by a speed controller, which 
allows the tested bearing to operate under vari ous speeds. Accelerometers are fixed on end cap 
closing to the tested bearing. The sampling frequency is 25.6 kHz. Data acquisition equipment is utilized to collect the vibration signals of bearings in normal and fault states via increasing the 
motor speed from 20 Hz to 40 Hz. The speed keeps st able for a period after increasing each 0.5 Hz. 
Under each constant-speed period, 10 sets of vibration signals are acquired. Each set of vibration signal contains 76,800 data points, i.e., 3 s. Figure 4 shows the variation of standard deviation of inverse hyperbolic cosine (Std of IHC) [9] and root mean square(RMS) values with the increase of speed under normal and fault states. From Figu re 4, two obvious rule s could be concluded: 
ÔÇü There is an approximately linear relationship between the motor speed and the extracted 
features whether in the norm al state or fault state. 
ÔÇü The fitting-regression lines of the features under the fault state have a la rger slope than those 
under a normal state, which means that the bearing in the fault state is more susceptible to speed than the bearing in the normal state.

are always submerged in strong background noise, SVD is employed to cancel the noise imbedded

and fault states. From Figure 4, two obvious rules could be concluded:
 There is an approximately linear relationship between the motor speed and the extracted features
whether in the normal state or fault state.
 The Ô¨Åtting-regression lines of the features under the fault state have a larger slope than those
under a normal state, which means that the bearing in the fault state is more susceptible to speed
than the bearing in the normal state.

Feature values in the fault state will deviate from the distribution of those in the normal state,
leading to statistically abnormal changes in RR values. Therefore, faults can be detected by evaluating
the extracted RR values.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed RR features, experimental data are further analyzed.
As described above, vibration signals of bearings in normal and fault states within the 20‚Äì40 Hz speed
range are Ô¨Årst de-noised by the SVD. Then, Std of IHC and RMS are selected from the dimensional
features to demonstrate the performance of corresponding RR features. The Std of IHC and RMS
values in the normal state and corresponding speed parameters are used to train the ELM empirical
model. The performance of the extracted RR features feature in the normal and fault state is shown
in Figure 6. It is seen that the amplitudes of RR features in the normal state are close to 0 and stay
stable. In the same fault degree, the amplitudes of RR features are greater than 0. In addition, they are
still stable without being inÔ¨Çuenced by the speed variation obviously. The results indicate that RR
features can well recognize the normal and fault state of bearings and also have a good resistance to
speed variation.

 Step 3: The RR feature is constructed as ›ï(=‹¥‹¥ ‚àí›ï ‡∑ú) ›ï‡∑ú‚ÅÑ, where ›ï is the actual feature value 
extracted from the measured vibration signal.  
Feature values in the fault state will deviate from the distribution of those in the normal state, 
leading to statistically abnormal changes in RR values. Therefore, faults can be detected by 
evaluating the extracted RR values. 
To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed  RR features, experimental data are further 
analyzed. As described above, vibration signals of bearings in normal and fault states within the 20‚Äì40 Hz speed range are first de-noised by the SV D. Then, Std of IHC and RMS are selected from 
the dimensional features to demonstrate the perfor mance of corresponding RR features. The Std of 
IHC and RMS values in the normal state and corresp onding speed parameters are used to train the 
ELM empirical model. The performance of the extrac ted RR features feature in the normal and fault 
state is shown in Figure 6. It is seen that the amplitudes of RR feat ures in the normal state are close 
to 0 and stay stable. In the same fault degree, the amplitudes of RR features are greater than 0. In addition, they are still stable without being influenced by the speed variation obviously. The results indicate that RR features can well recognize the normal and fault state of bearings and also have a good resistance to speed variation.

3.2. Health Indicator Construction 
In this module, GMM-based SNLLP is constructed to provide a fusion health indicator. When 
the feature set composed of RR features and non-dimensional features is extracted, an optimal degradation feature selection method is required to select the features with useful information about bearing degradation processes. Good condition monitoring features should be well correlated to

feature selection method is required to select the features with useful information about bearing
degradation processes. Good condition monitoring features should be well correlated to bearing
degradation progresses, monotonous increasing or decreasing, robustness to outliers caused by noise,
etc. Therefore, correlation, monotonicity and robustness metrics are utilized here for optimal feature
selection. An integrated metric about these three evaluation metrics is used [21]:

where Jis total degradation evaluation score whose values belong to the interval [0, 1],Corr(F,T)is

is the weight of each metric. Three degradation evaluation metrics are computed by virtue of the
following equations:
Corr(F,T)=jK√•kFT(tk)tk √•kFT(tk)tkjrh

where F(tk)is the degradation feature value at the time tk,FT(tk)is the trend value which can be
obtained by common smoothness method, FR(tk)is the residual random value, Kis the number of
total feature values and ()is the unit step function.
In order to select the degradation features that have good performance, the features whose J
have higher scores are primarily selected. The selected degradation features still have redundant
information. Therefore, the dimension of these selected features is further reduced by OLPP . The OLPP
is utilized here to retain the low-dimensional nonlinear manifold structure that is hidden in the data
set and better dig out intrinsic fault information [ 22]. The former principal components whose total
cumulative contribution rate is above 90% are retained.
At last, the reduced principal components are fused using a GMM-based method [ 23]. The GMM
is trained by the values of the reduced principal components under the normal state. Then, the trained
GMM is used to online fuse degradation features. For each new captured sample, GMM will generate
p(xijF)using Equation (6), and the SNLLP health indicator is calculated as follows:
SNLLP = logp(xijF). (15)
3.3. Incipient Fault Detection
In this module, based on the constructed SNLLP health indicator, a new alarm trigger mechanism
is designed to detect the incipient fault based on the analysis of the fault typical behavior. For example,
more abnormal Ô¨Çuctuation would appear in the signals and the amplitude of signals may increase
gradually. The proposed alarm trigger mechanism is composed of two criteria: (1) in a sliding time
window, the number of indicator values above the adaptive threshold has exceeded a safety number;
and (2) the indicator values in the sliding time-window present an increasing trend, which is evaluated
by the Spearman coefÔ¨Åcient.
------------------------------End of the page -----------------------------------
Materials 2017 ,10, 675 9 of 15
At Ô¨Årst, the adaptive threshold based on the Chebyshev‚Äôs inequality is established to identify
outliers. For an SNLLP indicator Im, the mean and Std of its index set at time mareXmand Sm
respectively. The Chebyshev‚Äôs inequality can be expressed as:
P Im XmkSm1
k2,8k>1, (16)
where kis threshold tolerance. For a given conÔ¨Ådence level 1/k2, the bound interval is expressed
as
Xm kSm,Xm+kSm
. Equation (16) means that the probability of Im/2
Xm kSm,Xm+kSm
is
less than 1/k2[24]. The former partial SNLLP indicators (I1,I2, . . . , Im)are selected to calculate the
initial bound:
Tm=XmkSm. (17)
As a new sample at time m+1is captured, judge whether the SNLLP value of the sample belongs
to the bound interval or not. If the sample belongs to the bound interval, it is added into the index set,
i.e.,(I1, . . . , Im,Im+1), the bound Tm+1is recalculated:
Tm+1=Xm+1kSm+1, (18)
where Xm+1and Sm+1are the mean and standard deviation of the index set (I1, . . . , Im,Im+1).
Otherwise, the sample is regarded as an outlier and the bound Tm+1is not updated.
Since the SNLLP indicator values always perform the gradually increasing trend during the whole
life cycle of bearings, the upper bound is selected as the detection threshold. Compared with random
Ô¨Çuctuation, more abnormal Ô¨Çuctuation would appear when incipient faults occur. Therefore, the Ô¨Årst
criterion is deÔ¨Åned as follows: the number of indicator values above the adaptive threshold in the
sliding time-window has exceeded a safety number. The safety number is determined by the threshold
tolerance and window length, which can be calculated by the following equation:
Sn=l
k2, (19)
where Snis the safety number and lis the window length.
When incipient faults occur, the indicator always performs the gradually increasing trend.
The Spearman coefÔ¨Åcient between the indicator and time is an effective tool to evaluate the
trend [ 25]. First, indicator fFigi=1:Nand timefTigi=1:Nare converted to their ranks ffigi=1:Nand
ftigi=1:N, and then the Spearman coefÔ¨Åcient rbetweenffigi=1:Nandftigi=1:Nis computed using the
following equality:

i=1

where fandtare the means offfigi=1:Nandftigi=1:N, respectively. When fFigi=1:Nis a monotonous
increasing or decreasing function of fTigi=1:N, the Spearman coefÔ¨Åcient requals +1or 1. On the
contrary, iffFigi=1:Ndoes not have a good monotonic relation with fTigi=1:N, therwill be close to 0.
Since the gradually increasing trend just performs after the incipient fault occurs, it is not a
wise choice using the Spearman coefÔ¨Åcient in all of the historical measurements. Application of the
Spearman coefÔ¨Åcient in the sliding time-window is able to increase the sensitivity of detecting the
local increasing trends. Therefore, the second criterion can be deÔ¨Åned as follows: the Spearman
coefÔ¨Åcient rin the sliding time-window is higher than 1/2. When the two criteria above are satisÔ¨Åed
simultaneously, it means that an incipient fault has occurred.

4. Industrial Data VeriÔ¨Åcation
4.1. Introduction to the Industrial Wind Turbine
In this section, the proposed method is demonstrated on the incipient fault detection of generator
bearings in wind turbines (WTs). As shown in Figure 7, the drivetrain of WTs mainly consists of
blades, gearboxes and generators. Vibration data is acquired from condition monitoring system (CMS).
The sampling frequency of accelerometers in the generator bearing is 25.6 kHz and 102,400 samples
(i.e., 4 s) are recorded about each 4 h. In addition, generator speed information of WTs is collected from
the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. Due to the inÔ¨Çuence of wind speed
and grid control, WT operates under varying speed characteristics. In the monitoring wind farms,
from 25 September 2014 to 9 September 2015, a generator bearing appeared to naturally degenerate.
Vibration signals during the whole lifetime of the bearing are shown in Figure 8.
Materials 2017 , 10, 675 9 of 14 
 Therefore, the first criterion is defined as follows:  the number of indicator values above the adaptive 
threshold in the sliding time-window has exceeded a safety number. The safety number is determined by the threshold tolerance and window length, which can be calculated by the following 
equation: 
‹µ
‡Ø°=›à
›á‡¨∂, (19) 
where ‹µ‡Ø° is the safety number and ›à is the window length.  
When incipient faults occur, the indicator always  performs the gradually increasing trend. The 
Spearman coefficient between the indicator and time is an effective tool to evaluate the trend [25]. 
First, indicator ·àº‹®‡Øú·àΩ‡Øú‡≠Ä‡¨µ:‡Øá  and time ·àº‹∂‡Øú·àΩ‡Øú‡≠Ä‡¨µ:‡Øá  are converted to their ranks ·àº›Ç‡Øú·àΩ‡Øú‡≠Ä‡¨µ:‡Øá  and ·àº›ê‡Øú·àΩ‡Øú‡≠Ä‡¨µ:‡Øá , and 
then the Spearman coefficient ﬂ© between ·àº›Ç‡Øú·àΩ‡Øú‡≠Ä‡¨µ:‡Øá  and ·àº›ê‡Øú·àΩ‡Øú‡≠Ä‡¨µ:‡Øá  is computed using the following 
equality: 
=ﬂ©‚àë‡µ´›Ç‡Øú‚àí›ÇÃÖ‡µØ(›ê‡Øú‚àí›êÃÖ)‡Øá
‡Øú‡≠Ä‡¨µ
‡∂ß‚àë‡µ´›Ç‡Øú‚àí›ÇÃÖ‡µØ‡¨∂‡Øá
‡Øú‡≠Ä‡¨µ‚àë(›ê‡Øú‚àí›êÃÖ)‡¨∂ ‡Øá
‡Øú‡≠Ä‡¨µ, (20) 
where ›ÇÃÖ and ›êÃÖ are the means of ·àº›Ç‡Øú·àΩ‡Øú‡≠Ä‡¨µ:‡Øá  and ·àº›ê‡Øú·àΩ‡Øú‡≠Ä‡¨µ:‡Øá , respectively. When ·àº‹®‡Øú·àΩ‡Øú‡≠Ä‡¨µ:‡Øá  is a 
monotonous increasing or decreasing function of ·àº‹∂‡Øú·àΩ‡Øú‡≠Ä‡¨µ:‡Øá , the Spearman coefficient ﬂ© equals +1 
or ‚àí1. On the contrary, if ·àº‹®‡Øú·àΩ‡Øú‡≠Ä‡¨µ:‡Øá  does not have a good monotonic relation with ·àº‹∂‡Øú·àΩ‡Øú‡≠Ä‡¨µ:‡Øá , the ﬂ© 
will be close to 0. 
Since the gradually increasing trend just performs after the incipient fault occurs, it is not a wise 
choice using the Spearman coefficient in all of the historical measurements. Application of the Spearman coefficient in the sliding time-window is able to increase the sensitivity of detecting the 
local increasing trends. Therefore, the second cr iterion can be defined as follows: the Spearman 
coefficient ﬂ© in the sliding time-window is higher than 12‚ÅÑ. When the two criteria above are 
satisfied simultaneously, it means th at an incipient fault has occurred.

influence of wind speed and grid control, WT oper ates under varying speed characteristics. In the

4.2. RR Features Extraction of WT Bearings 
Original features in Table 1 are extracted from de-noised vibration signals of the bearing by 
SVD, i.e., 11 time-domain features, nine frequency-domain features and 16 time-frequency-domain features. In the time-domain features, two features are extracted, which are Std of IHC and standard deviation of inverse hyperbolic sine (Std of IHS) [9]. In the frequency domain, the harmonic amplitude sum (HAS) of and the harmonic energy sum (HES) of the ball-pass frequency outer ring 
(BPFO), ball-pass frequency inner ring (BPFI) and ball-spin frequency (HAS-BSF) are extracted, 
respectively. The sum of the three HAS features and the sum of the three HES features, which are 
named HASS and HESS, are calculated as well. In addition, a feature named ‚Äúpower ratio of maximal defective frequency to mean‚Äù (PMM) [26] is used as follows:

entire frequency energy. 
The 16 time-frequency-domain features are energies (E) and energy ratios (ER) of eight 
frequency bands decomposed by three-level wavelet packet decomposition. The db6 is selected as wavelet basis. The sampling frequency of accelerometers in the generator bearing is 25.6 kHz. Thus, the whole spectrum is divided into eight frequenc y bands where each frequency band has a range of 
1600 Hz.

In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed RR features, partial features have been
intuitively compared with the corresponding RR features, which are shown in Figure 9. As mentioned
before, the generator speed during the whole life cycle has larger Ô¨Çuctuation due to the inÔ¨Çuence
of wind speed and grid control. It is seen that, with the generator speed variation in a wide range,
peak-peak (PP) values have a larger and regular Ô¨Çuctuation. Especially when the generator speed
gradually decreases, the PP values also have a decreasing trend around 6000 h. It cannot effectively
reÔ¨Çect the bearing degradation trend at this moment. In contrast, the PP-RR has a small Ô¨Çuctuation
with the change of speed. The amplitudes of PP-RR are stable before 4000 h. It does not have an
obvious decreasing trend with the speed decreasing around 6000 h. The PP-RR presents an increasing
trend during the whole life cycle, which can better reÔ¨Çect the degradation trend of the bearing.

Then, OLPP is utilized to remove redundant information in the selected 18 degradation
features. The selected 18 degradation features are reduced as three principal components (PCs).
The dimensionality reduction result is shown in Figure 11a. At last, the GMM-based method is
utilized to fuse the three principal components. The normal data set, i.e., the former 1000 h principal

that, with the fusion of these PCs, SNLLP shows more obvious degradation trends than these PCs and

Based on the statistic characteristics of the SNLLP values, the incipient faults are detected by the 
proposed alarm trigger mechanism in Section 3.3.  The former 1000 h SNLLP values are used to 
calculate the initial threshold. 
To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed  method, another two approaches proposed by 
Ginart et al. [12] and Li et al. [7], respective ly, are applied for comparison. The results of these 
approaches are shown in Figure 12. It is seen that as a new measured sample is captured, the 
adaptive threshold in our approach is updated co ntinuously. There are some outliers caused by 
noise locating out of the adaptive threshold, whic h are marked by ‚Äú*‚Äù. Ginart‚Äôs approach gives a 
false alarm during the normal state of the bearing. It is unable to exclude outliers caused by noise 
disturbance due to lacking a rational alarm trigger mechanism. Li‚Äôs result lags behind our approach seriously because this approach is based on all historical data. When the incipient fault appears, the 
change of probability is slow. However, our pr oposed alarm trigger mechanism has detected the

5. Conclusions 
Aiming at the health monitoring of bearings  under varying speed conditions, this paper 
proposes an accurate incipient fault detection me thod. Based on the dependence relation analysis 
between speed and dimensional feat ures, RR features based on ELM are proposed to better reflect 
the degradation trend of bearings under varying speed conditions. Then, the SNLLP health 
indicator is constructed to fuse multi-parameter features. Finally, based on the constructed SNLLP 
health indicator, an incipient fault alarm is tri ggered by the proposed alar m trigger mechanism. The 
proposed method is demonstrated using vibration signals from test rigs of bearings and industrial WTs. The results show that the RR features are insensitive to the varying speed conditions and are able to quantitatively reflect the degradation trend of bearings. The proposed alarm trigger 
mechanism is more reliable and accurate for the detection of incipient faults compared with two 
other alarm trigger mechanisms. 
Although this study has improved the accuracy of the incipient fault detection for bearings 
under varying speed conditions, the selection number of original features is still set subjectively. How to determine the selection number of original features adaptively is still a problem that needs to be researched in our future.

5. Conclusions
Aiming at the health monitoring of bearings under varying speed conditions, this paper proposes
an accurate incipient fault detection method. Based on the dependence relation analysis between speed
and dimensional features, RR features based on ELM are proposed to better reÔ¨Çect the degradation
trend of bearings under varying speed conditions. Then, the SNLLP health indicator is constructed
to fuse multi-parameter features. Finally, based on the constructed SNLLP health indicator, an
incipient fault alarm is triggered by the proposed alarm trigger mechanism. The proposed method
is demonstrated using vibration signals from test rigs of bearings and industrial WTs. The results
show that the RR features are insensitive to the varying speed conditions and are able to quantitatively
reÔ¨Çect the degradation trend of bearings. The proposed alarm trigger mechanism is more reliable and
accurate for the detection of incipient faults compared with two other alarm trigger mechanisms.
Although this study has improved the accuracy of the incipient fault detection for bearings under
varying speed conditions, the selection number of original features is still set subjectively. How to
determine the selection number of original features adaptively is still a problem that needs to be
researched in our future.
